BigLS ? The 1st International Workshop on Big Data in Life Sciences  June 13, Crown Plaza, New Orleans Airport, LA and Medical Sciences (ICCABS 2013)  Message from the Workshop Co-chairs  Ananth Kalyanaraman (ananth@eecs.wsu.edu) School of EECS, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99164  Jaroslaw Zola (jaroslaw.zola@rutgers.edu) Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers Discovery Informatics Institute, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854   With the ever-increasing volume, velocity and variety biological and biomedical data collections continue to pose new challenges and increasing demands on computing and data management. The inherent complexity of this big data has forced us to rethink how we collect, store, combine and analyze it.

The International Workshop on Big Data in Life Sciences (abbreviated as ?BigLS? and pronounced as ?Beagles?) is an annual workshop dedicated to the broad theme of big data analytics in life sciences. The goal of the workshop is to bring together leading researchers and practitioners working on a diverse range of big data problems related to biology and medicine, and engage them in a discussion about current big data problems, the state of computational tools and analytics, current and imminent challenges, and the future trends within life sciences.

Specific topics in this inaugural edition of the BigLS workshop include:  - Next-generation sequencing and assembly - Metagenomics and metaproteomics - Systems biology and informatics - Network science and analytics - Statistical and integrative approaches to big data biology and informatics - Scientific workflows and platforms - High performance computing tools and challenges   This year?s workshop constitutes a series of 8 invited talks, including 2 keynote talks by luminaries in the field of big data biological analytics, followed by a joint panel with focus on addressing key questions that relate to the identification of key applications areas within biology that need big data analytics, and obtaining a fundamental understanding and characterization of key challenges involved in developing the next generation of algorithms and software for this important and emerging domain.
