Abstract-Optical device is a telecommunications device that uses  glass or plastic media made from silica and SiO2 to transmit data  using light or LED (Light Emitter Diode) as the data is  transmitted. Silica is one of the materials / media that serves as  the transmission of data on the component microring resonator.

This paper, investigate about the characteristic of microring  resonator and specifically about the temperature effect on the  cascaded parallel microring resonator. In this paper, also  explains the resistance of the microring resonator for the various  temperatures are given. How big is the change in the wavelength  shift is happening and how the resulting output of wavelength. A  cascaded parallel microring resonator is simulated using MatLab  to analyze the temperature effect on the ring resonator  components. This simulation also uses the couple mode theory to  get the value of coupling coefficient. The wavelength used in this  simulation was C-Band between 1530-1565 ?m. The simulations  result shows the resistance of the components cascade-parallel  microring resonator for a certain temperature. The simulated  temperature are varied between 28o Celcius to 500o Celsius.

Based on the simulation result it can be concluded that the  change in temperature will change the resonance wavelength. As  the temperature is increased, the resonance wavelength shifts  (The increased temperature will affect to the shifting of  resonance wavelength). The results of this study, a temperature  parameters are given to the resilience of the microring resonator.

I. INTRODUCTION  The devices used in communication system is a  combination of electronic and optical technologies. In distance  communication, optical fiber has been largely used and  powerful tool which has been developed with very high  performance respect to the transmission speed, the number of  wavelengths and transmission distance. advantages of optical  technology can be used with the bulk of technical performance  is very good but the disadvantage is a very high cost. Today,  metropolitan networks are using optical communication  networks. Even in Indonesia has been implemented, the  system uses fiber optics and many telecommunications  companies that use them.

The basic configuration of MR consists of a straight  waveguide and a ring resonator. MR as optical filter has  attracted much attention because of their high wavelength  selectivity in combination with the small size. In general, a  device with a full configuration that serves as a MR optical  filter consists of two ports with a straight waveguide MR. MR  devices can be assembled by a single ring or multiple rings in  a serial or parallel configuration[1].

The background of this research, based on paper [2] that  simulates the resistance temperature on MR. This paper is an  outgrowth of the paper [2] on temperature resistance. The  different of this paper with the previous paper [2] lies in the  MR component. In the current study uses the concept of  parallel MR series which will be described in chapter II  (theory). In the previous paper [2], described the effect of  temperature on single MR. This paper using a variety  parameter of temperature as a function to determine how much  of the effect of temperature on the result of transmission on  MR.



II. THEORY  Frequency band used in this study were C-band ranging  from 1.530 ?m up to 1.565 ?m. C-Band is the frequency band  commonly in use in optical communications. Various  frequency bands were shown in Table 1.

Historically, the O band frequency, called the first, at 0.8-  0.9 ?m, however, the losses were high at this frequency so that  the window is used primarily for short-range communications.

Lower frequency (O band and E band) around 1.300 ?m has  much lower loss. Intermediate frequency (S band and C band)  around 1.500 ?m are most widely used. This frequency has the  lowest attenuation loss[3].

Microring Resonator (MR)  MR is a technique that uses the technique of coupling to  transmit data to multiple destinations, such as for example is  the WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing)  communication system. employment system MR as well as  WDM, ie several wavelengths (lambda) is transmitted in a  single channel (mux). As an illustrative example is shown in  Figure 1. For example, there are multiple wavelengths to be transmitted in a single channel (?1, ?2, ?3, ?4). If the  wavelength used is ?3, then the other wavelengths (?1, ?2, ?4)  will return and will serve as input to the transmission of data  to transmit again.

Figure 1. Illustration of MR  Figure 2 illustrates the basic configuration of MR,  which consists of unidirectional coupling between a ring  resonator with radius R and Ei2 waveguide. R is radius of of  ring and Ei2 =    .

Figure 2. Model of a single ring resonator with one coupling coefficient[5]  Defining that a single unidirectional mode of the  resonator is excited, the coupling is lossless, single  polarization is considered, none of the waveguide segments  and coupler elements couple waves of different polarization.

The various kinds of losses occurring along the propagation of  light in the MR filter are incorporated in the attenuation  constant, the interaction can be described by the matrix  relation[4]:  [    ]    [    ] [     ]          (1)  Et1 = Ei1 t + jEi2 K          (2a)  Et2 = jEi1 Kt + Ei2 t          (2b)  The complex mode amplitudes E are normalized, so  that their squared magnitude corresponds to the modal power.

The coupler parameters t and ? depend on the specific  coupling mechanism used. The   denotes the conjugated complex value of t and ?, respectively. The matrix is  symmetric because the networks under consideration are  reciprocal. Therefore[4]:  |t | + |K  | = 1           (3)  Ei2 = ? . e j?  Et2           (4)  From (1) and (4) we obtain:  Et2 =    (5)  This leads to the transmission power Pt1 in the output  waveguide, which is:        (6)  Where t = |t| exp (j ?t), |t| representing the coupling  losses and ?t the phase of the coupler. The circulating power  Pi2 in the ring is given by:        (7)  On resonance, (  + ?t) = 2 ? m, where m is an integer, the following is obtained[4]:        (8)  B. Cascaded-Parallel MR  The parallel configuration in Figure 3, MR arranged in  such a way that there is no direct interaction between the rings.

MR parallel configuration offers more flexibility to the  manufacturing process compared with other configurations.

Figure 3. Model parallel coupled MR  Each MR refractive index or neff there. In the parallel  configuration, the distance from one ring to another ring is  very close. Value of L also determines the response filter and  L being the circumference of the ring. Therefore, this distance  should be chosen carefully to obtain the desired interference in  the range of a specific wavelength.

When optimizing the response filter design for a desired  wavelength, L should vary like one other parameter. In  addition to allowing precise phase relationship, the distance  should be set to be large enough to avoid direct interaction  between the ring with other rings[1].

Ei2 = Et2 exp    (9)  Where L = 2?R, and R is radius of ring. By  substituting equation (2) to (9), we obtain the transmission  amplitude of an optical MR for cascaded parallel as follows :                   (10)  Where ? = exp (- ??R) and ? = ? L. So, from  equation (10), the power for the transmission of cascaded  parallel MR is obtained[5]:           (11)

For the first, we find neff values obtained from MatLab  function and bisection method. After neff values obtained, and  then find value of coupling coefficient from couple mode  equation. Coupling coefficient value is inserted into the  formula of MR. After that, conversion MR equation to  cascaded parallel equation. And the last, the value of  temperature effect on MR can be obtained from .



IV. DISCUSSION  Figure 5 is the transmission power of MR as formulated  in equation (10), with the parameters used are as follows :  refractive index n1 (core) = 1.468 ?m cladding refractive index  n0 (cladding) = 1463 ?m, h = 5 ?m wide. By Figure 5, shows  the normal power of MR as a function of wavelength and it?s a  single MR.

Figure 5. Transmission power of MR  Figure 6, shows the transmission power as a function of  wavelength in MR with radius of core R (Cascade Parallel),  where the distance between the rings was maintained in order  to avoid interference.

Figure 7. Transmission power of MRR with a comparison between room temperature and 3 simulated temperatures  The  refractive index of the optical materials is not a  constant parameter over temperature region in which the  materials, such as crystals, semiconductors and glasses are  used in different optical devices or system. The variation of  the refractive index with the temperature at constant pressure  is called the thermo optic coefficient. The analysis of thermo  optic coefficient are essential to characteristic the temperature  dependent nonlinear optical devices, the optical fiber  communications system, semiconductor technology and the  ultrafast femstone technology.

The sellmeier coefficient at any temperature T are  computed from the room temperature sellmeier equation and  the smoothed dn/dt or C values by calculating refractive index  from the relations[5]:  (12)  Sellmeier equation is the relationship between  refractive index and wavelength for a particular media. This  equation is used to determine the dispersion of light in the  medium[6].

Figure 8, shows that the temperature affects the value  of refractive index. The higher the value of refractive index  with the increase in temperature occurs. By equation (11), we  can get a way to give a temperature which will be used on MR  that will make a difference in the stimulation of MR.

Figure 8. Comparison between refractive index with increased temperature  Figure 9, Explain the comparison between room  temperature (T0=28 o Celcius) and high temperature (Tmax=500  o   Celcius). Another parameters used is n1= 1.468, n0= 1.463  with width of core (h) = 5 ?m, R = 14.7 ?m. When the  temperature is increased, the value of wavelength will go up as  well (shifted).

Figure 9. Transmission power of MRR with a comparison between room  temperature (T0=28 o Celcius) and high temperature (Tmax=500  o Celcius)  Figure 10 is the simulation result using difference ??  between T1= 150 o Celcius, T2= 325  o Celcius and T3= 500  o   Celcius. We can see the difference between the temperature of  o Celcius to 500  o Celcius, when the temperature reaches  o Celcius then obtained a wavelength shift from 1539  ?m  to 1540 ?m. When the temperature shifts to 325 o , the  wavelength shift up from 1.542 ?m to 1.540 ?m. And final  temperature 500 o Celcius with wavelength 1.542 ?m shift up  to 1.544 ?m.

V. CONCLUSION  Distance between the first ring with the next to be  maintained, because if it does not cause interference or  coupling process may occur in the transmission process and  will result in failure in the transmission that allows the entire  wavelength will be sent back as desired.

Wavelength shift caused by temperature used in  parallel cascaded MR is not too significant. The shift that  occurs in only a few wavelengths. Although the optical  communication system using light as the transmission, which  use temperature is not too high, because the high temperatures  may result in damage to optical devices.
