Mining Target-oriented Fuzzy Correlation Rules in Telecom Database

Abstract   In this paper, we propose an algorithm for mining  the target-oriented fuzzy correlation rules to discover the strong correlations between a specific telecom service and other services from a telecom database.

We show how, by using the fuzzy statistics analysis, the target-oriented fuzzy correlation rules can be obtained from a given database. Our work can assist the telecom service provider in finding the services highly related to the most popular telecom service. This kind of information is quite useful for the telecom service provider to provide the appropriate services to their customers for effective churn management.

1. Introduction   In telecommunications industry, which changed from a rapidly growing market into a fierce competition and saturated market, suffers a critical issue of the customers who are easily to change a telecom service provider to another ones. For telecommunications industry, however, acquiring a new customer will pay much higher costs than retaining an existing one, and thus, decreasing the churn rate has become more and more important. The goal of churn management is not only to discover the customers who might be lost but also provide them the correct services they want. Thus, to effective churn management, a useful technique for finding the telecom services which the customers really want is needed.

In all data mining techniques, mining association rules is often defined as finding the itemsets which frequently occur together in a given dataset [1, 2, 10, 12]. The general form of an association rule is ,BA  where A and B are two itemsets, and ?=BA . A wide  application of mining association rules is to identify the customers? behaviors in various business databases.

For example, in telecommunications industry, mining association rules can help us to extract the sets of the telecom services which are frequently used by the same customers in the telecom database. Clearly, this kind of information is useful for understanding the popular sets of the telecom services which they provide for their customers. However, two services which are frequently used by the same customers can not always imply that there exists a strong relationship between them. For example, assume that a telecom service S  is popular and used almost by all customers, then the service S is very likely used with other services frequently by the some customers, but in fact, the relationships between this service and other services may be not strong. Thus, mining association rules may generate some misleading information for a telecom service provider to provide appropriate services to their customers. In this case, mining the correlation rules may be a good way to find the telecom services which the customers really want.

Mining correlation rules is a procedure of finding the itemsets which are highly related to each other from a given dataset [4, 10, 12]. However, in practical telecom databases, data are not only described by binary values but also are described by quantitative ones, such as the number of times that a customer used in a period time, waiting to be explored, therefore, methods for discovering the correlation rules from these quantitative data are also needed. For avoiding the shape boundary problem, the concept of fuzzy set theory [17] is commonly used in this case to transform these quantitative data into the fuzzy items or the fuzzy attributes, and this kind of fuzzy rule is called the fuzzy correlation rule.

To discover the services which the customers really want, we propose an algorithm for mining the target-  2009 Advances in Social Network Analysis and Mining  DOI 10.1109/ASONAM.2009.63     oriented fuzzy correlation rules to focus on finding the strong correlations between the most popular service and other services according to the numbers of times that the customers used. Our work can help the telecom service provider to retain the telecom services highly related to the most popular service. In this paper, we show how, by using the fuzzy statistics analysis, the target-oriented fuzzy correlation rules can be obtained from the given database. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Some basic concepts involved in mining the fuzzy correlation rules are introduced in section 2. The proposed algorithm for mining the target-oriented fuzzy correlation rules is presented in section 3. An experiment is displayed in section 4. The conclusions are given in section 5.

2. Preliminaries   Some basic concepts involved in mining the fuzzy correlation rules are introduced in this section.

2.1. Fuzzy association rule   Mining fuzzy association rules is the task of finding the fuzzy itemsets which frequently occur together from the given database [3, 5, 7-14].

Let },,,{ 21 mfffF = be a set of fuzzy items, =T  ),,,{ 21 nttt be a set of fuzzy records, and each fuzzy  record it  is represented as a vector with m  values,  ),(),(( 21 ii tftf  )),(, im tf  where )( ij tf  is the degree  that fuzzy item jf appears in record ?)(, iji tft  ].1,0[  Then, a fuzzy association rule is defined as an implication form, such as AF ,BF  where FFF BA ?,  are two fuzzy itemsets, and .BbballAaaall FfFf ?????  A  fuzzy association rule BA FF holds in T with the  fuzzy support, }),,({ BA FFfsupp and with the fuzzy  confidence, )( BA FFfconf [9].

The fuzzy support and the fuzzy confidence of the fuzzy association rule, BA FF , are defined as follows:  n  FFftf FFfsupp  BAjij  n  i BA  }),{|)((min }),({ 1  ?  = =  (1)  })({  }),({ )(  A  BA BA Ffsupp  FFfsupp FFfconf =            (2)  If the }),({ BA FFfsupp is greater than or equal to the  predefined threshold, minimal fuzzy support, and the )( BA FFfconf is also greater than or equal to the  predefined threshold, minimal fuzzy confidence, and then the fuzzy association rule, AF ,BF  is considered  an interesting fuzzy association rule.

2.2. Fuzzy correlation rule   While the task of mining fuzzy association rules concerns the co-occurrence of the fuzzy itemsets, the task of mining fuzzy correlation rules focuses on the correlation relationships among the fuzzy itemsets. In previous researches [15, 16], we have presented an algorithm to discover fuzzy correlation rules by using the fuzzy simple correlation analysis [6].

Assume that },,,{ 21 mfffF = is a set of fuzzy items;  ),,,{ 21 ntttT = is a fuzzy dataset with n records, and  each record it  is represented as a vector with m values,  )),(,),(),(( 21 imii tftftf where )( ij tf is the degree that  fuzzy item jf occurs in record ].1,0[)(, ?iji tft  Then,  the form of a fuzzy correlation rule is ,BA FF ? where  BA FF ,  F? are two fuzzy itemsets, and ??? Aaaall Ff  .Bbball Ff ??  A fuzzy correlation rule BA FF ? holds in  T with the fuzzy support, }),,({ BA FFfsupp and with the  fuzzy confidence, ),( BA FFfconf ? and with the fuzzy  simple correlation coefficient, .,BAr  The fuzzy support and the fuzzy confidence of ,BA FF ? are the same as of a fuzzy association rule.

The fuzzy simple correlation coefficient of BA FF ?  is  defined as follows:  BA  BA BA ss  s r  ? = ,,                          (3)  , where   ))(())((1 ,  ?  ??? =  =  n  tt s  n i BiBAiA  BA  ???? (4)  }){|)(min()( AjijiA Fftft ?=?                    (5)  }){|)(min()( BjijiB Fftft ?=?                    (6)  })({ AA Ffsupp=?                         (7)  })({ BB Ffsupp=?                         (8)  AA Ss =                               (9)   BB Ss =                             (10)   ))((    ?  ?  = =  n  t S  n  i AiA  A  ??  (11)      ))((    ?  ?  = =  n  t S  n  i BiB  B  ??  (12)  Similarly, if the }),({ BA FFfsupp of BA FF ? is  greater than or equal to the minimal fuzzy support; the )( BA FFfconf ? of BA FF ?  is greater than or equal  to the minimal fuzzy confidence; the BAr , of BA FF ?  is  also greater than or equal to a predefined threshold, called the minimal fuzzy correlation coefficient, and then the fuzzy correlation rule, ,BA FF ?  is considered  an interesting fuzzy correlation rule as well.

3. Target-oriented fuzzy correlation rules   To discover the strong correlations between a popular telecom service and other telecom services according to the numbers of times that the customers used, we propose an algorithm for mining the target- oriented fuzzy correlation rules. A target-oriented fuzzy correlation rule is a fuzzy correlation rule with a fuzzy item we specify. In this section, we show how, by using the fuzzy statistics analysis, the target-oriented fuzzy correlation rules can be obtained from a given database.

Assume that },,,{ 21 mfffF = be a set of fuzzy items,  and tF  is the target fuzzy item of F ; ),,,{ 21 ntttT =  be a fuzzy dataset with n  records, and each sample record it  is represented as a vector with m  values,  )),(,),(),(( 21 imii tftftf where )( ij tf is the degree of  the fuzzy item jf belongs to record it , )( ij tf  ? ]1,0[ .

Before staring the algorithm, three user-predefined thresholds ,,,, fff rcs need to be determined, where fs  is the minimal fuzzy support, fc is the minimal fuzzy  confidence, fr  is the minimal fuzzy simple correlation  coefficient. The details of the algorithm are described as follows:  Step 1: For each fuzzy item Ff j ? , the value of  )( jfS is computed.

n  tf fS  n  i ij  j == 1  )( )(                                 (13)  Step 2: Let 1L be the set of the fuzzy items whose  value of )( jfS  is greater than or equal to fs .

TF  is the fuzzy item with the largest value of  )( jfS .

Step 3: Let TFLL ?= 1 '  1 .

Step 4: Let 2C  be the set of the combinations of '  1L  joint with .TF   }.|),{( '  12 LFFFC ATA ?=  Step 5: For each member of ,2C say ),,( TA FF the  value of the fuzzy support, }),,({ TA FFfsupp  and the value of the fuzzy simple correlation coefficient, ,,tAr are computed respectively by  formula (1) and by formula (3).

Step 6: Let 2L is the set of the members of 2C  whose  fuzzy supports are greater than or equal to  fs and fuzzy simple correlation coefficients  are greater than or equal to .fr  Step 7: Let '2C be the set of the combinations of '  1L  joint with .'1L  ,,|),{( '   '  2 LFFFFC CBCB ?=  }.CB FF ?  Step 8: For each member of ,'2C say ),,( CB FF the  value of the fuzzy support, }),,({ CB FFfsupp  and the value of the fuzzy simple correlation coefficient, ,,CBr are computed respectively  by formula (1) and by formula (3) as well.

Step 9: Let '2L is the set of the members of  '  2C  whose  fuzzy supports are greater than or equal to  fs and fuzzy simple correlation coefficients  are greater than or equal to .fr  Step 10: Generate each ,3, ?kCk  by '  1L  joint with  .1?kL  Assume that DF is a member of '  1L ;  ),( FE FF  is a member of ;1?kL  the size of EF  is .e If ),( DE FF  is a member of 1?kL or '  1?kL ,  then the combination )},,({ FDE FFF is a  member of kC . Similarly, if ),( DF FF  is a  member of ekL ? or ,'ekL ? then the combination  }),{,( DFE FFF is also a member of kC .

Step 11: For each member of ,kC say ),,( GF FF the  value of the fuzzy support, }),,({ GF FFfsupp  and the value of the fuzzy simple correlation coefficient, ,,GFr are computed respectively  by formula (1) and by formula (3).

Step 12: Let kL is the set of the members of kC  whose fuzzy supports are greater than or equal to fs and fuzzy simple correlation  coefficients are greater than or equal to .fr  Step 13: Generate each ,3,' ?kCk  by '  1?kL  joint with     .' 1?kL  Assume that ),( QP FF and ),( RP FF  are  two members of ;' 1?kL the size of PF  is ;p  the size of the union set },,{, RQ FF is a ;pk ?  and then the combination }),{,( RQP FFF  is a  member of kC .

Step 14: For each member of ,'kC say ),,( YX FF the  value of the fuzzy support, }),,({ YX FFfsupp  and the value of the fuzzy simple correlation coefficient, ,,YXr are computed respectively  by formula (1) and by formula (3).

Step 15: Let 'kL is the set of the members of '  kC  whose fuzzy supports are greater than or equal to fs and fuzzy simple correlation  coefficients are greater than or equal to .fr  Step 16: Repeat step 10 to step 15, until next ' 1+kC  is  an empty set.

Step 17: For each number of ,2, ?kLk say ),,( ZW FF  two candidate fuzzy correlation rules with ,TF ZW FF ? and ,WZ FF ? can be generated.

If the fuzzy confidence of a candidate rule is greater than or equal to fc , then this fuzzy  correlation rule is considered an interesting rule.

4. Experiment   A simple dataset sampling from a real telecom database is shown in Table 1. Each entry ijt of Table 1  is the number of times per month that the customer Cidi used the telecom service Sj averaged over eight months.

Before starting the procedure of mining the target- oriented fuzzy correlation rules from this dataset, the thresholds need to be determined in advance. Here, fs  is set to 0.25, fc is set to 0.80, fr is set to 0.30.  First,  we use the formula (14) to determine the degrees of interesting to the telecom services for each customer, and transform the Table 1 into Table 2. Therefore, each entry ijt of the Table 2 is the degree of interesting that  the customer Cidi used the telecom service Sj.

Next, the experimental steps are described as follows:     Step 1: For each telecom service jS , ,51=j the  value of )( jSS  is computed and listed in  Table 3.

Step 2: According to Table 3, },,,,{ 543211 SSSSSL = ,  and .2SFT =  Step 3: Let .1 '  1 TFLL ?=  Thus, }.,,,{ 5431 '  1 SSSSL =  Step 4: Let 2C  be the set of the combinations of '  1L  joint with .tF   Therefore, ,(),,{( 3212 SSSC =  )}.,(),,(), 25242 SSSSS  Step 5: The fuzzy support and the fuzzy simple correlation coefficient of each member of  2C  are computed and listed in Table 4.

'  2L '  3C  is  an empty set, and thus, the step 14, step 15, step 16, are ignored.

Step 17: According to 2L and ,3L ten candidate fuzzy  correlation rules with 2S are generated. The  fuzzy confidences of these candidate rules are computed and shown as in Table 7.

In addition, the rule (16) show us  that there is a strong relationship between telecom services { 1S , 2S } and telecom service 3S . In original  telecom database, 1S represents the dramatic service;  2S  represents the adult service; 3S  represents the sport  service.

5. Conclusions   In this paper, to discover the strong correlations between a specific telecom service and other services, we propose an algorithm for mining the target-oriented fuzzy correlation rules. Our experimental results can find out the services highly related to the most popular telecom service. Of course, this kind of information is quite useful for the telecom service provider to provide the appropriate services to their customers and remove useless services to reach effective churn management in telecommunications industry.
