MMIR: Mining Multi-scale Intervention Rules in  Sub-Complex System

Abstract?Intervention analysis is the common method to reveal relationships between objects in human as well as biological society. Data mining research community is just starting to pay attention to intervention analysis. As the traditional association rules are not successful at measuring intervention, this paper tries to mining intervention rules from time series data of sub- complex system. The main contributions of this study include: (1) introduces a new concept of intervention rules. It can quantitatively detect at what scale, how intensive and how long the intervention does make sense; (2) conduct wavelet transform on time series. The decomposition scale can denotes the intervention scale; (3) proposes a new concept named directional correlation to measure intervention intensity; (4) calculates the intervention intensity between time series data with different time delays. The time delay can uncover after how long the intervention takes place; (5) conducts experiments on real datasets. The results show that intervention rules do exist at different decomposition scale of the original data. Moreover, the number of rules discovered by multi-scale analysing methods is always 4 or 5 times more than those found by single scale methods. And the stability of rules discovered by the improved multi-scale mining algorithm MMIR* is always 100%, while the stability of rules discovered by the basic multi-scale mining algorithm MMIR fluctuate around 70%.

I.  INTRODUCTION In the fields of market regulation, unemployment rate  control and influenza supervision, intervention is widely used to control the stability of the system. It is with important economical value for the government. 1  This study focuses on mining intervention rules between two time series data of sub-complex systems. An intervention rule (IR) from time series X to Y is a three tuple in the form of Interv(X?Y)=(scale, delay, intensity). Example 1 explains the meaning of IR and each tuple in an IR.

The patient may occasionally suffocate while sleeping. Thus, the burst of breath rate would cause abnormal fluctuate of heart rate.

The meaning of Interv(breath rate?heart rate)=(3, 2, 0.7) is: (1)3: breath rate interferes with heart rate at the third frequency scale; (2)2: after 2 seconds the change of breath rate will interfere heart rate; (3)0.7: the intervention intensity is 0.7.

The following compares the difference between IR and correlation in intervention measurement.

Why IR can measure the intervention from breath rate to heart rate?

Why the traditional correlation coefficient can not?

(1) Intervention must have direction. IR is directional, i.e.

from breath rate to heart rate while correlation is not.

(2) Intervention must have time delay. The second tuple of  IR can represent time delay while correlation can not.

(3) Intervention must have quantitative intensity. The third  tuple of IR can represent intensity while correlation only represents the linear similarity between two series.

(4) Intervention is multi-scale because signals interfere with each other in a specific brand of frequency. The first tuple of IR can represent the frequency scale while correlation can not.

Tang et al. [1] firstly introduced the concept and the tasks of intervention rules mining. Zhang et al [2] proposed the naive intervention rules mining method based on association rules.

Yang [3] proposed the algorithm MIPES to mine interventions in parallel event sequences.

In another aspect, Literatures [4~7] researched the hidden relationship between temporal sequences via pattern matching.

2010 12th International Asia-Pacific Web Conference  DOI 10.1109/APWeb.2010.35     Multiple resolution analysis [8], wavelet transform [9]and correlation analysis[10] are widely used in time series analysis also. However, many researches consider time series to be an atomic sequence. In practice, the series may contain several sub-series. Thus, to obtain interest relationships, it is more important to analyse those series at multiple scales.



II. MINING MULTI-SCALE INTERVENTION RULE  A. Goal of this study Given a pair of two time series, the goal of this study is to  firstly generate all candidate intervention rules, and then returns rules with intensity higher than a specified threshold.

B. Generate candidate intervention rules The algorithm can be described by example 2.

Example 2: Consider example 1. Figure 2 shows how to  generate intervention rules from breath rate to heart rate. The algorithm contains straightforwardly three key steps.

Figure 2 Generate candidate intervention rules Step 1.Decompose the original time series into 2 sub-series at decomposition scale 1 and 2 using discrete wavelet transform (Fig 2b,c).

Step 2.Shift breath rate of each sub-series (Fig 2b,c) along the time axis forward 1 timestamp (Fig 2 d, f) and 2 timestamps (Fig 2 e, g). This step results in 4 kinds of relationships between breath rate and heart rate.

Step 3.Calculate the intensity of the 4 sub-series between breath rate and heart rate.

Thus 4 candidate intervention rules can be generated. The meaning of variables in algorithm 1 is given in Table 1.

This paper proposed two types of intervention intensity r1 and r2. Let Corr be the traditional correlation, and DirCorr be directional correlation proposed by this paper. The following paragraphs will concentrate on explaining DirCorr.

r1 = (Corr(Xs,d, Ys,d)+Corr(X?s,d,Y?s,d)/2 (1)  r2 = (DirCorr(Xs,d, Ys,d)+DirCorr(X?s,d,Y?s,d)/2 (2) Definition 2 Let X=X(1, t) be a time series. Then x(i) (1<i<t) is called burst point of X if |x(i)|>|x(i-1)| and |x(i)|>|x(i+1)|.

Definition3 Let X(1, t) and Y(1, t) be two time series with equal length t. The Directional Correlation between X and Y (DirCorr(X, Y)) is defined as:  ? =  ?== m  k t YXDirCorr  ji,kkkkji, )  ij))(wj,Y(i),j,Corr(X(i*w),(  (3)  X(ik, jk) needs to satisfy three conditions.(1) For any k, X(ik), X(jk) are burst point of X; (2) For any ik?p?jk, X(p) is not a burst point.(3)X(i1, j1)?X(i2, j2) ???X(ik, jk)=X(1,t);  Step 1  (1, 1, 0.2)  Step 2  (1, 2, 0.4) (2, 1, 0.7) (2, 2, 0.1)  Step 3  a  b c  d e f g     Proposition1. Let X=X(1,t)=(X(i1,j1),?, X(im,jm)), Y=Y(1,t) =(Y(i1,j1),?, Y(im,jm)), be two time series with equal length t.

Corr(X,Y)=r. For any k, 1?k?m, X(ik), X(jk) are burst points.

(1) if Corr(X(ik,jk), Y(ik,jk))>r, then DirCorr(X,Y)>r; (2) if Corr(X(ik,jk), Y(ik,jk))<r, then DirCorr(X,Y)<r; (3)0?DirCorr(X,Y) ?1 Proof: Consider (1). By Equation 2, if Corr(X(ik,jk), Y(ik,jk))>r, we have DirCorr(X,Y)> wi1,j1*r+?+ wim,jm*r =r.

Thus, (1) is proved. Similarly, it?s easy to prove (2)(3).

According to proposition 1, The correlation of temporally adjacent points will not be weakened by other points.

Moreover, because those temporally adjacent points are selected according to the burst points of X, thus, DirCorr(X,Y) can quantify the intervention from X to Y.



III. EXPERIMENT AND PERFORMANCE STUDY The dataset is obtained from Santa Fe time series[19] data  set B1. It contains the breath rate and instantaneous heart rate of a sleeping human suffering from sleep apnea. We take the former 10000 records and normalize both series to zero mean and unit variance. All experiments are conducted in matlab6.5, Pentium 1.7G, 512 M memory.

The decomposition scale ranges from 0 to 4. The shifting length ranges from 0 to 3. Only rules with intensity higher than 0.5 will be returned. MMIR uses traditional correlation to calculate intensity. MMIR* uses directional correlation.

A. The discovery ability of intervention rules Table 2 shows the number of rules discovered by MMIR  and MMIR* as the time series length increases. The results show that intervention rules which are not obvious in the original series are usually hidden in decomposition scales.
