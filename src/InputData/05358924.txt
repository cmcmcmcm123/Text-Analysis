A Fuzzy Calendar-based Algorithm for Mining Temporal Association

Abstract Fuzzy temporal association rules can take into account the temporal requirements of the user which tend to be ill-defined or uncertain. However, fuzzy temporal association rules still have some shortcomings: firstly, neglecting the effect of all kinds of potential negative examples that affect its expression capability; secondly, probably showing no practical significance or even misleading even if it possesses high confidence and support. In this paper, the relativity-based interest measure value is introduced based on the fuzzy calendar-based temporal association rules, and a fuzzy calendar-based temporal association rules mining algorithm with interest measure is also proposed. Finally, this algorithm was applied to the prediction of telemetry data from the power system of small satellite. It was proved that this algorithm has a good effect and feasibility.

Keywords: Association rule, Interest measure, Fuzzy calendar constraint, prediction    1. Introduction  Recently, discovery of temporal association rule has drawn more and more attention. Users are hard to specify the temporal requirements accurately. Thus a  fuzzy calendar-based algebra is developed to allow users to describe desired temporal requirements in fuzzy calendars easily and naturally. A fuzzy calendar-based temporal association rules was proposed by Wan-Jui Lee [1]. A advanced multidimensional time series fuzzy association rules was proposed by Wei-Hong Guo [2]. A fuzzy temporal association rules within valid time intervals was proposed by Yan Pan [3], and an algorithm based on FP-tree is devised for mining temporal association rules.

Fuzzy temporal association rules possess high confidence and support. In practice, it?s quite not enough if just possess high confidence and support.

Considering the impact of negative examples, the rules will have no practical significance or even mislead users. It is not the credibility of or support is not high, but even if it has a high degree of confidence and support, the actual value of the rules has been difficult to ensure. That is to say, their interest has been generated reduced. Thus we have proposed a solution, the introduction of the third threshold ?Interest measure. Bing He [4] proposed a interest measure based association algorithm, introduce the interest measure into association rules, improve the actual value of association rules.

These deficiencies are the problem must confront in   DOI 10.1109/FSKD.2009.347    DOI 10.1109/FSKD.2009.347       practical applications. To have a wider range of real value, we need to improve the practical significance of fuzzy temporal association rules. To deal with the aforementioned problems of fuzzy calendar-based temporal association rules, a new approach make use of relativity-based interest measure value presented in association rules is proposed in this paper. The algorithm was applied to the prediction of data from the power system of small satellite, and its effects turned out to be good, the practicality of the algorithm is proved to be satisfied.

2. Problem Solution   In this section we will introduce the conception of interest measure. The definition of the improved interest measure and our proposed fuzzy calendar-based temporal association rules will also be given.

2.1 The Introduction of Interest Measure  Degrees of interest are used to perform users? concerns of the rules. Such metrics are users? comprehensive measure of the simplicity, certainty, practicality and novelty of rules. Mining at different goals and different mining environment, the degree of the rule which a user?s concern with is different. For example, the rule that "at a certain period of time, many cash flow happened through a group of people", when the mining is designed to identify potential bank customers, this rule is not much effect; when mining aimed at distinguish the criminal, this rule will be great concern because of crime are at a certain period of time happened many cash-flow anomaly. Interest measure of the rules consists of directive interest and objective interest.

Current research focuses on the objective interest.

Objective interest is the user's objective concern about rules. It is mainly depend on the specific structure and data used in the mining process of the rules. This kind  of measurement has the generality. To avoid too many people? views about the rules affect the effectiveness, statistical methods is applied to the definition of rules, thus ensuring its effectiveness.

According to the improved definition of association rules proposed by Hao Feng Zhou, etc.[5]and the definition of interest based on relevance proposed by Han, etc.[6], this paper analyzes the deficiencies of interest in the existing mining algorithm and improved fuzzy calendar-based temporal association rules algorithm.

2.2 Definition of Improved Association Rules  and Interest Measure   Credibility-support threshold of fuzzy time series association rules cannot account for the negative situations. For example, we cannot get a rule that can be used to express the situation: the possibility for customers to buy the cookies and will not buy the milk is 20%, and 52% of the transaction records is not bought cookies and milk at the same time.

Obviously, such purchase trends (that is, bought cookies and do not buy milk) in real life are likely to exist. However, because of the definition for fuzzy time series association rules, the results in data mining will lose very useful information.

Considering the negative situations, the association rules can be defined as the following forms to solve the problems above. That is, the definition of the association rules can be written as the following forms of implicit formula:  Definition 5(Modified association rules)  1p ? 2p  ??? lp ? 1lp + ? 2lp + ??? np ? 1q ? 2q  ??? kq ? 1kq + ? 2kq + ??? mq ?2?where  { 1p ? 2p ??? np } ? I? { 1q ? 2q ??? mq } ?  I? { 1p ? 2p ??? np }?{ 1q ? 2q ??? mq } = ? ?       And ip ?T? jq ?T? 'ip ?T? 'jq ?T ?1?i?l?  l+1?i??n, 1?j?k? k+1?j??m? for each transaction log/record T that supports the rules.

Thus, we can express the sentence above as follows:  ?coffee?? ' 'milk ?C= 0.20?S= 0.52  Here, the relevant concept of probability is giving before the definition of interest measure.

The probability of the possibility of the incident can be described as: happened probability of case X in transactions can be express as P (X). P?XY?is the probability that case X and Y happened at the same time. Thus, if P?XY?= P?X?P?Y?, while the definition the case X and Y in transactions is independent of each other, if P?XY?? P?X?P?Y?, while the case X and Y in transactions is not independent of each other (that is case X and Y relevant).

According to association rules and the definition of probability, we can see:  Supp?XY?=P?XY? Supp?X?=P?X? Supp?Y?=P?Y?  Definition 6(Interest Measure based on Correlation)   Given transaction set D, the interest measure of the association rules X?Y on D is defined as:  RI = ,X YCorr = ( ) ( ) ( )  Supp XY Supp X Supp Y  = ( ) ( ) ( ) P XY  P X P Y   Where, ,X YCorr  is the relevant degree of the rules,  When ,X YCorr >1, case X appearence and case Y  appearence are positive correlation; when ,X YCorr <1,  they are negative correlation; when ,X YCorr =1, they are  independent of each other.

Definition 7(Improved Association Rules) Given translation set D, the association rules X?Yon D, the  support threshold min_sup, confidence threshold and  interest measure Ri .Only if Supp ? min_sup?Conf ?  min_conf? RI ? Ri > 1 are established, said X?Y for  the improved association rules. Where Ri is defined by  users.

In this way, the mining criterion of the entire  association rules are unified within the framework of probability theory. From the perspective of probability of relevance, The support reflects whether an item/case set in transactions is a general rule; The confidence reflects the direction of rules relationship, that is, from X to Y or from Y to X; The interest measure reflects the relationship among association rules, by which we can see how close between X and Y.

3. Improved Fuzzy Calendar-based Temporal Association Rules Mining Algorithm   Based on the analysis above, a fuzzy calendar-based temporal association rules within interest measure is proposed, its basic idea is as follows:  1? The transaction database is divided into n zones  ? 1D ? 2D ??? nD ?, each partition includes  only the basic time period determined by the smallest fuzzy calendar time granularity (such as the minimum time granularity is days ,then the basic time period is one day) of transactions, calculating the weight of each partition (degree of membership), as well as generate positive frequent itemsets L.

2? Filtered all frequent itemsets generated by the first step using the weighted confidence level and interest threshold, resulting in the usual sense of the association rules.

3? Considering the negative of the association rules of which interest less than one, as they       meet the weighted confidence level and threshold of interest measure, then generate the association rules.

4. Algorithm application   Here is an example of the power system?s remote sensing data of a certain type of satellite. According to previous theory of Association Rules Data Mining, we should firstly transform satellite?s remote sensing data into the form of itemset, which is formed by the cases happened in different channel during the same period.

The format of each item in itemset is # # # * XX, all in the form of Arabic numerals. The top three figures represent the channel number, where to fill ?0? in front when the data is not three-figure. The fourth figure represents the transform direction, which "0" on behalf of lower, and "1" on behalf of higher. The last two figures represent the extent of change, which is in the form of percentage. In addition, when data does not change, the latest three digits should be "000". For example, the output change of above-mentioned 27-volt voltage regulator can be expressed as 057103, meaning that the data increased by 3%. In this way, taking the cases happened during the same period as an itemset, which would be arranged in chronological order, we can finally get a generate of a text file as input of Association Rules Mining at last.

The mining job of Spacecraft?s channel data association rules is carried out at Matlab programming environment. Procedure?s Frequent Itemset search algorithm is using the above-mentioned calendar fuzzy association rules algorithm.  Aimed at mining the output voltage change of Satellite power subsystem?s nickel-cadmium battery pack, firstly we get a generation of data files to be excavated, and then do the mining job applying the fuzzy calendar temporal association rules with Interest Measure, and finally obtain Interested Association Rules which is extracted from the data files. Rules listed in Table 4-1 can be used to guide the AHP algorithm to determine the  structure of the matrix. Table 4-2 has listed the negative association rules which can be used to guide the AHP algorithm to determine the matrix structure.

From the mining results of association rules, we can see the Association Rules of mining process come to an agreement with experts? judgement.

Application of the mining results of Association Rules in AHP algorithm prediction causal adjustment [7], [8]. Take spacecraft data as research object, and a certain satellite?s nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) battery pack voltage as prediction variables, we have studied some key factors that affect variables, and calculated factors? adjustment coefficient to prediction variables.

Therefore, we can add temporal adjustment factors to prediction process, and modify the causal prediction method without considering the causal affection. Based on this method, we have predicted the Ni-Cd battery pack voltage, and added the casual adjustment algorithm to original prediction model, and then multiplied the current changing value of each affecting factors by corresponding total adjustment coefficient, and then plus the output of prediction model, and estimate the prediction interval at the confidence level 95%. The result is showed in Figure 4-1 and Fig 4-2.

Fig4-1 is casual adjustment when doing data mining job by using Apriori algorithm, while Fig 4-2 is the result after casual adjustment using interested fuzzy calendar casual associated rules. It can be seen clearly that the later method increase prediction accuracy greatly, and reduce the prediction interval along with the increase of accuracy.

5. Conclusion   The potential problems of considering only confidence and support on the existing fuzzy calendar-based algorithm for mining temporal association rules is discussed in this paper. Firstly, the association rules do not consider all the capable negative influence of sample, and after the modification of definition of the association rules, we       found that though one rule get high confidence and support, it still have no actual significance even misleading. Therefore, we put forward an idea about adding a threshold value based on the correlation interest measure, and give out formal definition and practical significance. The rules are considered as interested and mined, only if the threshold value of the rules is higher than the designated interest measure.

Finally, the algorithm is proved that it is effective in  the data prediction on the power system of a small satellite.
