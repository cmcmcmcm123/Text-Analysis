Improved Algorithms Research for Association Rule Based on Matrix

Abstract  In association rules, although Apriori algorithm uses cut-technology when it generates item sets of candidates, it has to scan the entire database while scanning the transaction database each time. The scanning speed is very slow for its large amount of data. The improved Apriori algorithm based on matrix is improved from the Apriori algorithm and the matrix algorithm. Its basic idea is transforming the event database into matrix database so as to get the matrix item set of maximum item set. When finding the frequent k-item set from the frequent k-1item set, only its matrix set is found. So only the corresponding data are calculated to get frequent k item set. Therefore the improved Apriori algorithm ? s computing time is very fast. Simulation data are used in experiments to compare the speeds of the improved Apriori algorithm and the Apriori algorithm. The results of the experiments prove the efficiency of improved Apriori algorithm.

Apriori algorithm is an influential algorithm to mine association rules. Apriori applies iterative methods named Layer by Layer Search. To search frequent item sets fast, Apriori applies Anti-monotonicity of frequent item sets to compress search space. DHP algorithm applies Hash technique and Reduction technique of event database to increase the efficiency of Apriori algorithm. TreeProjection algorithm generates frequent item sets by determining item sets in a lexicographical order. Association rules mine AprioriTid optimization algorithm, AprioriTid optimization algorithm optimizes (1)event compression and item compression; (2) key words recognition of candidate item sets. The Association Rule Mining Algorithm on improved market basket analysis introduces interestingness weighting. The Association Mining Algorithm based on matrix constructs effective data matrix and  effectively cut the data matrix to search frequent item sets, which reduces a great amount of search time of higher-frequent item sets. The Mining Association Rulebased on equivalence relation generates candidate frequent item sets based on equivalence and equivalence class, which reduces the expense of the system. Apriori algorithm mentioned in the literature is the most influential algorithm to mine Boolean frequent item sets.

Apriori algorithm applies Reduction technique when it generates its candidate item sets, but it has to scan the entire database each time, which leads to the slow speed. Aiming at the disadvantages of Apriori algorithm and matrix algorithm and combining the advantages of the two algorithms, a new improved algorithm is proposed.

The improved Apriori algorithm based on matrix is improved from the Apriori algorithm. Its basic idea is transforming event database into event matrix library A, finds the maximum item set P while transforming , then finds items in the maximum item set P and the mat of the item set, then finds its S(Support), at last all the frequent item sets are found. In this way, scanning the database one time results in frequent item sets directly without the process of finding candidate item sets in Apriori algorithm. Therefore the data amount to be scanned is small and the speed is very fast. In an event database D with m data records, its any event Tk = [ Ik1 , Ik2, , Ik3 , ? Ikm ] ?k=1,2,?,m?, then Apriori-sort algorithm is dealt with in the following 4 steps: 1) Find the maximum item set: scan all of the event database D, find the maximum item set P in event item set Ti(i=1,2,3,? n), that is, P= {Pm|m=1,2,3,?,and Pm?Ti, i=1,2,3,?,n} 2)Find matrix library Amxn?Assume that the event item set in event database D is Ti(i=1,2,3,?,m)?and the maximum item set in D is P=[I1,I2, I3 , ?In ]?Assume that in matrix Amxn item aij ?1?i?m, and 1?j?n?is 1 when event Ti in database D includes item Ij in the maximum item set P, , otherwise  0.

3) Find Mat(Ij,Ik,Id) of any item set IjIkId: Assume that the event item set in event database D is P=[I1,I2, I3 , ?In ], and the maximum item set in D is P=[I1,I2, I3 , ?In ]?the matrix of event matrix library in event database D is Amxn, the mat of item set IjIk is Mat(Ij,Ik), the mat of item Id is Mat(Id)?then the mat of item set IjIkId is  iii IdMatIkIjMatIdIkIjMat )(*),(),,( = ?  4) Find frequent item sets: From Mat(Ij,Ik,Id) of item set IjIkId and Theorem 1, find its S(Support)  mIdIkIjMatIdIkIjSupport m  i i /)),,((),,(  ?  =  = ? if its  S(Support) is less than its minimum S(Support), then the item set is frequent item set, otherwise delete the non-frequent item set.

2. The improved Apriori algorithm based on Matrix  The basic principle of the improved Apriori algorithm based on Matrix is finding the mat of event database. In an event database D with m data records, its any event Tk = [ Ik1 , Ik2, , Ik3 , ?Ikn ]?k=1,2,?,m?, then the Apriori-sort algorithm is shown as follows: 1)  MaxItemSet(D,P);// find the maximum item set P in event database D  2)  SwapJuzhen(D,P,A);// from the maximum item P, transform transaction database D into the corresponding matrix library A 3) for(i=0;i<n;i++)//n is the item number of the maximum item set  { c1[i]=0?// / S(Support)of an item of initialization is 0  for(j=0;j<m;j++)//m is the item number of the maximum database  c1[i]= c1[i]+A?ij?;// find S(Support) of an item if (c1[i]>=minsup)// If S(Support) of an item is more than or  equal to the minimum S(Support), then the item set is frequent item set  l1=l1?{ c1[i]}//, add a frequent item set ?// get a frequent item 4?while(lk-1!=null)// As long as frequent item k-1 is not empty, keep finding frequent k item set JuzhenGen(lk-1,A,minsump);// from frequent k-1item set, get frequent k item Function SwapJuzhen(D,P,A) in the algorithm are as follows: procedure  SwapJuzhen(D,P,A) for(i=0;i<m;i++)// m is the record number of the maximum database  { for(j=0;j<n;j++)// n is the item number of the maximum  item set ? if (Ik?P?j?)// If item Ik is the j item of the maximum  item set, A(ij)=1?    //the value of the matrix is 1 else//otherwise A(ij)=0?    // the value of the matrix is 0 ?  ?//transform database D into matrix library A  Function JuzhenGen(Lk-1,A,minsump) in the algorithm are as follows: procedure  JuzhenGen(Lk-1,A,minsump) for each I1?Lk-1;//l1 is an item set in frequent k-1 item set for each I2?Lk-1;//l2 is another item set in frequent k-1 item set  { if(I1[1]=I2[1] ? I1[2]=I2[2] ? ? ? I1[k-2]=I2[k-2] ?  I1[k-1]?I2[k-1])//the first k-2 items in frequent k-1 item set are the same but the last item is different  cl=0;// S(Support) of an item of initialization is 0 for(i=0;i<m;i++) {  Mat(I1[1] ? I1[2] ??? I1[k-2] ? I1[k-1] ? I2[k-1])i= Mat(I1[1]?I1[2]???I1[k-2]?I1[k-1])i* Mat(I2[k-1])i;//form k item set       Cl=cl+ Mat(I1[1]?I1[2]???I1[k-2]?I1[k-1]?I2[k-1])i;//find S(Support) of k item set  } If (cl>=minsup)// S(Support) is more than or equal to the  minimum S(Support) { I1=I1?I2[k-1]);//get frequent k item set Lk=Lk?{I1};//add frequent item set to k item set ?  ?  3  Simulation Experiment and Analysis  Qualitative analysis of complexity of time: The improved Apriori algorithm based on matrix scans the database D once without finding candidate item sets when searching frequent item sets. Therefore the improved Apriori algorithm based on matrix computes much faster than the traditional one does.

To prove correctness and effectiveness of the improved Apriori algorithm based on matrix, about 500-5000 sample data are chosen (the sample data document is standard simulation datasets on association rules provided by the Almaden Center of IBM Company), under the same hardware configuration, the work efficiencies of Apriori algorithm and the improved Apriori algorithm based on matrix are tested 10 times. In these tests, the computing time of the two algorithms is compared under the same software and hardware configuration, that is, both with the hardware of Intel(R) Pentium(K) 2.80GHZ CPU?1GB memory? 80GB and Windows XP sp2 operating system. The authors find that the mined results of the two algorithms are the same in all the computing of the simulation data, but the computing time of the improved Apriori algorithm based on matrix is far less than that of Apriori algorithm. The results of the experiments are shown in table 2 and picture2.

Table 2 Computing time of the two algorithms  Record  number  Apriori Computing time?ms?

Picture 2 is the curve of the change of computing time of  the two algorithms with the change of event amount when the tested record number is 500-5000.  The abscissa is the event data amount in event database, the ordinate is the computing time. From this picture, the computing time of the two algorithms becomes longer with the increase of the event data amount, but the computing time of the improved Apriori algorithm does not go up so fast, and the computing time of the improved Apriori algorithm based on matrix is far less than that of Apriori algorithm.

4  Conclusion  Mining the association rules are of great practical value, it is applied widely in the field of data mining.

Because of the large scale of event database mined, the working efficiency of mining algorithm of association rules becomes extremely important. The authors have made a deep study on Apriori algorithm and design an improved Apriori algorithm based on matrix. This algorithm only scans the event database once, then transforms an event database into event matrix library shown in binary data and mines the matrix library. The experiments show: the efficiency of mining time of the improved Apriori algorithm based on matrix is higher. At the same time, the improved Apriori algorithm based on matrix can be applied on any occasion when Apriori algorithm is applicable.
