I. INTRODUCTION  Association rule is an important research in data mining and was first introduced by Agarwal and other researchers. This rule is used to find the relationships between items of the transaction data sets in order to provide reference for decision-making. The traditional algorithms of association rules consider that rules in the database is permanently effective. However, because the transaction data sets usually have the time characteristics, the rules change greatly with time. To set up a Meta-association rule for the rule is more intuitive to describe the tendency of rule changes and is better for decision-making. In order to describe the regularities of changes over  time in association rules, Liu preliminarily introduced the new technology of dynamic association rules in reference [1]. This article, which is based on the fact that rules change with time, introduces the definition of Meta-rules of dynamic association rule, and uses integrated method such as AR-Markov models to mine the Meta-rules of dynamic association rule.



II. RELATED DEFINITIONS AND THEOREMS  A. Definition of dynamic association rule  Dynamic association rule is a type of association rule, which can describe the changes  of itself. Let 1 2  { , , , } m  I i i i  be a set of items,  Let D be the task-relevant data, which is collected during a time period t, and t can be divided into n disjoint time segment which  makes a time series 1 2  { , , , } n  t t t t . According  to t, D can be divided into n subsets  1 2 { , , , }  n D D D D , where ( {1, 2, , })  i D i n  is collected in the time segment  ( {1,2, , }) i t i n . Let T set of items such that  T I , if A and B are set of items, ,A I B I and A B There are related  definition of dynamic association rule as  This work is supported by the Industrial Technology Research  Project of Lanzhou 2009-1-4   DOI 10.1109/NSWCTC.2010.248    DOI 10.1109/NSWCTC.2010.248         follows.

The support vector ( SV ): The support vector of a dynamic association rule A B (or set of items A B )is defined as:  1 2( ) ( ) ( ) [ , , , ] .

nA B A B A B SV s s s st    ( ) ( ) ( {1,2, })  i i A B A B i  s f D i n    1  ( ) iA B f is occurrence frequency of items B in  subsets ( {1, 2, , }) i  D i n , iD is transaction  number of iD , Let support  of  item set B  be S , then:  ( )   ( )( ) i  n  A B  i  A BA Bs s f M f M    2  Confidence vector (CV): The confidence vector of a dynamic association rule A B is defined as:  1 2( ) ( ) ( ) [ , , , ] .

nA B A B A B CV c c c st  ( ) ( ) ( )  i i i i  n  A B A B A A B A i  c s s s s      (3)  Where ( )iA Bs  is the NO.i element of SV ,  iA s  is the NO.i element of  A s  in item set A.

So the dynamic association rules can be defined as: ( , , , )A B SV CV s c , where , , ,SV C V s c  can be computed according formula 1 2 3 ,and SV CV s c together describe the  characters of the rule.

B. Definition of meta-association rule  The formal definitions of meta-association rule for dynamic association rule as follows:  definition 1:In datasets 1 2  { , , , } n  D D D D ( {1,2, , })i n ,  the support vector of meta-association rule in  rule A B  is defined as 1 2( ) ( ) ( )  [ , , , ] nA B A B A B  SV s s s  or 1 2  [ , , ..., ] n  SV f f f if and only if there are  (1 )i i n  to cause ( ) m in _ s u piA Bs ,  where min_ sup  is given the minimum support, then meta-association rule of the dynamic association rule in datasets D is defined as:  :A B SV .

Similarly, the meta-association rule of  confidence vector in datasets 1 2  { , , , } n  D D D D  ( {1, 2, , })i n  is defined as :A B CV .

C. Auto Regression (AR) model description  Definition of AR model: let n  samples, which is same range or has same scope range, to compose the stationary normal and zero mean  time series tx (t=1,2,?,n). if k>p, if it?s relation  coefficient ,k k  0 then series tx  to fit in with  AR  model  ( ) t tB x a    or  1 1 2 2t t t p t p tx x x x a ,  where 1 1, , , n  is AR coefficient, ta  is residual.

AR model parameter estimation: The parameter estimation of AR model time series is selecting suitable parameters to make the residual at of model white noise. Commonly used method is moment estimation, maximum likelihood estimation, the least sum of squares estimates, least square estimation, and so on.

This paper is use of the least squares method to estimate model parameters. The specific process of calculating is shown in reference [3] and [4]  Test of AR model: In this paper, the testing rule of residual white noise and AIC rule to test AR model. AIC rule is also called information rule, whose formula is: 2( ) ln 2aAIC p N p ,  where p is model order, N is the length of time  series { tx }, when { tx } is stationary normal         distribution time series, 2 21  N  a tN t  a ,  where N is number of data, ta  is residual.

D. Markov chain and it?s transition probability matrix  Let Ei be the state of time t, actual value Xn always corresponds with the state-space, then Markov chain forms. For any integer n,  ( ) { | }, ( , ) m k m  k ij j ip P X E X E i j n  shows  that the system is in the state of Ei conditions at the time of m, and system is in the state of probability Ej at moment of m+k. Sequence  ( )k ijp  in order, we can get the matrix as follows:  ( ) ( ) ( ) 11 12 1 ( ) ( ) ( )  ( ) 21 22 2  ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 2  k k k n  k k k k n  k k k n n nn  p  p p p p p p  p p p      The matrix is called k-step transition probability matrix of Markov chain. In the  matrix, for ( )  n  k ij  j  p suppose the number of  original samples transferring from Ei to state Ej after k steps is Mij. The original number of  samples in state Ej  is Mi , then ( ) ij i  Mk ij Mp . So  tendency and the future state can be predicted based on the state transition probability matrix.



III. INTRODUCTION OF THE META-ASSOCIATION RULES FOR DYNAMIC  ASSOCIATION RULE  From the chapter 1.1, we can see that the dynamic association rules can be described by four parameters, the support vector  vector confidence support and confidence. We establish the meta-association rules of dynamic association rules to predict the possible value of the support and confidence in the next state. At present, the method to propose the establishment of a meta-association rules are those based on  probability and statistics is proposed in reference [6]. We propose one method which based on AR-Markov model, detailed steps are as follows:  1) The CV series { 1 2 , , ,  n f f f } as original  series { tx } t=1,2,?,n pre-process the data in  order to get normal and zero-mean time series, when {xt} is the stable and non-mean time series,  then estimate the average of { tx } and take the  zero treatment.

2) test selection and estimation of the model parameters. First of all, take AR(1) as the suitable Model, Estimate the AR model parameters and get the models of every order according to the least square method. Finally, select the minimum-order of AIC value.

3) use AR to predict the fitting value of the actual series , and by calculating the difference between fitting value and the actual value, as well as the percentage of the difference.

4) conduct state division to the difference percentage according to the forecast results of support frequency, growth of the support vector series and Markov chain analysis methods.

5) Calculate the probability ijP  of each state  transferring to any other state through the theory that frequency is close to probability, and then get a one-step transition probability matrix P and k-step transition probability matrix P(k).

6) forecast the next state through one step transition probability matrix, that is to forecast the k-th state through the k-step transition probability matrix. Through the forecast, we can get the probability of the k-th value.

7) We take the median value of the state transition interval as the final forecasted value.



IV. EXAMPLE ANALYSIS  This paper modifies the algorithms of dynamics association rules in documents[2] and         then applies it to the sale database of a supermarket in years 2006 and 2007, and finally gets the rule, A B, which means, a customer buys A on the premise of purchasing B, then the support count of every month in these two years, SV=[162,175,162,156,174,157,154,177,159,171, 166,162,171,183,163,152,165,175,167,170,170, 167,171,164] and establish the AR-Markov model , investigate the trend of rule changes, and predict the support count of the rule in 2008.

steps:  1)Take the given series as the original series{xt} t=1,2,?,24  and establish the AR  model 1 1 2 2t t t p t p tx x x x ,  use the least squares and AIC rule, when p=9  a =38.2765 and AIC=90.8967 reached the  minimum value, and parameters list is:  =[ 0.2027,-0.2177,-0.1417,0.2197,0.0757  ,0.0539,-0.0415,0.3362,0.5307]  2)We use the model to fit the data in 2007 and then get table 1, the data in the table is the actual value, forecast rule of support counting and the difference percentage in 2007.

TABLE I. AR MODEL FORECAST RESULTS IN   Month Actual  Forecast  value  percentage  %  state  1 171 166 -2.924 E2  2 183 171 -6.557 E2  3 163 164 0.6135 E3  4 152 163 7.2368 E4  5 165 174 5.4545 E4  6 175 168 -4.0 E2  7 167 171 2.3952 E4  8 170 161 -5.2941 E2  9 170 175 2.9412 E4  10 167 169 1.1976 E3  11 171 162 -5.2632 E2  12 164 172 4.878 E4  The data in the table shows:  the forecasted average error got through AR model in 2006 is: -0.1886%, and the maximum error in the year is: 7.2368%, so the result of AR model forecast is acceptable.

3)According to the forecast results of support frequency and  Markov chain analysis methods, it is divided five states based on  percentage : state E1: the percentage is less than -8%; state E2: percentage is greater than -8% and less than -2%; state E3: the percentage is greater than -2% and less than -2%; state E4: percentage is greater than 2% and less than 8%; state E5: Percentage is greater than 8%.  the state of forecast difference between the percentage is shown in table 1.

4) Calculate the state transition probability to determine state transition matrix. From the analysis we can see that the rule in 2006 for the state transition is shown in table 2:  TABLE II. STATE TRANSITION IN 2007  from table 2 we can get one step transition probability matrix  0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 0 . 6 0  0 . 5 0 0 0 . 5 0  0 . 5 0 0 . 2 5 0 . 2 5  P    from part 1.4 we can get:  0 .4 4 0 0 0 .1 9 0 0 0 .3 7 0 0  ( 2 ) 0 .3 5 0 0 0 .2 2 5 0 0 .4 2 5 0  0 .3 5 0 0 0 .1 6 2 5 0 .4 8 7 5  P    0.3680 0.1805 0.4515  (3) 0.3950 0.1762 0.4288  0.3950 0.1919 0.4131  P  5) From the transition probability matrix, we  state  E2 state  E3 state  E4 Total  state  E2 1 1 3 5  state  E3 1 0 1 2  state  E4 2 1 1 4  Total 4 2 5 11         can get the probability of every possible state for the support counts of the rules on the first quarter of 2008, that is shown as table 3:  TABLE III.  PROBABILITY VALUE ON THE SUPPORT  COUNT OF THE RULE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008  6) select the median value as a final forecast, the forecasting results of the rule's support count in  the first four months of 2008 are as shown in table 4.

TABLE IV.  USE AR-MARKOV MODELS TO FORECAST  THE RESULTS  Forecast  range  Median  forecast  state  probability  Jan [159,166] 163 0.50  Feb [167,173] 170  0.4400  March [168,178] 173  0.4515  From Table 4, we can see that with the use of this model, we can get the forecast range of the January 2008 is [159,166], the median forecast is 163, but with the direct use of AR model, the value we get is 168, and the actual value is 162, it indicates that the value got from direct use of the model is more reliable than that from the AR model. This model applies to large fluctuations and more random forecast of original data. We have used determining state range based on time-series forecast and combined with Markov process to amend the value of fitting time series simulation, which will not bring about greater Markov forecast error, and the data got when such applications are mixed shows that the accuracy is better than a single use of time-series model. Table 4 also shows the support for the rule in the next three years on the rise. According to the median forecast and the probability of state which are  proposed by AR-Markov model we can grasp the future change trends of support for dynamic association rule.



V.  CONCLUSIONS  This article is based on  reference [1, 2] ,  has put forward the concept of dynamic association rules, introduced the definition of Meta-association Rules for dynamic association rule, put forward a AR-Markov model based mining method for meta-association rule of dynamic association rules. The mining method overcomes the shortcomings of big differences or uneven distribution in data got from static association rule mining algorithms. The results of the example in this paper shows that  the fitting accuracy and forecast accuracy of forecasts are much higher. This model is suitable to be used to mine meta-association rule when there is much historical and irregular data. We can more accurately grasp the trend of rules change through fitting the trend of rule changes and forecasting the future data, so that the dynamic association rule mining will get the more accurate results under the guidance of reasonable meta-association rule.
