I.  INTRODUCTION The research on time segments of cyclic association rules  started in the early stages at home and abroad. Such as the discovery of Temporal Constraint Association Rules made by Ou-yang wei-ming[1], but he did not discuss the Cycle Association Rules. The paper [2] by OzdenB raised Cyclic Association Rules is determined by man, the users use their experience to give a unit of time and cycle length (time units for the integer multiple). Then Cycle Association Rules are solved in line with the affairs existed in these time segments.

This often brings about that the division of time segment is not very accurate, and it is more likely to miss a number of Cycle Association Rules. So far, the problems of the existing Cycle Association Rules discovery arithmetic are mentioned in details as bellow.

A. The choice of time segment data For the problem of paper [2] by Xu min has raised a new  discovery model on Cycle Association Rules [4][5] . Through clustering analysis, a cycle is divided into time segments which have different lengths, thereby Cycle Association Rules can be discovered more accurately. However, this discovery model of Cycle Association Rules choose the number of affairs which occur every moment as the characteristic point of time segments data to cluster, the clustering is carried out for services, and projects have their own distribution, this clustering approach can?t reflect the laws of individual projects.

We set an example to illustrate, for a period of time, 0:00 to 14:00 of each day are showed in Figure 1, for example, in text [4][5] ,according to the number of affairs occurred in each moment we can cluster the affairs occurred in the time segment of 1~5,6~12 into the same category. Each time clustering occurred in the number of items 3-8 for each segment in terms of time A moment occurred in the number of projects (including the number of projects  A?s affairs) can be clustered.

In the time segment 3-8, A support project is 66% ,In the time segment 1-5,A support project is 41.3%,In the time segment 6- 12,A support project 38.6 %.If the minimum support is 54%, according to the text [4][5] the clustering method can not be found that this method is the frequent, However, Project A clustering by the number of items that occurred each time can be found frequently.

Although the cluster according to the occurred affairs every moment can solve the problem in the text [4][5], it is still has problems. Because this cluster only consided that the number of projects took place every moment and ignored the total number of services occurred every moment. While the number of projects are the same between the two moments, the total number of services between two moments might be different and make the support of the two projects different. However, only support for the project each moment can truly reflect and decide whether it is frequent or not. Therefore, clustering according to the project is an one-sided consideration of the  Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Fund ,No.Y1090603 Zhejiang Science and Technology Department Project,No.2009C35012 Zhejiang Forestry University Science Project,No.200728 Zhejiang Forestry University Teach Innovate Project,No.YB0848     number of project took place in every moment ,it can?t reflect inherent laws of the degree of support each moment. So, we continue to set an example of the situation in Figure 1 to illustrate the problem. In the Figure 1,because according to the number of the occurring items that the time between 3-8 is a kind of clustering, if the minimum support changes to 72%, in such a case, the time between  3-8 is not  frequent. But if we cluster by the ratio between the number of services every time and the total numbers of the occurring services at that moment, the 6-8 time segment can clustered into one category which its program?s degree is equal to 75%,so the program A in the 6-8 time segment is frequent. However, program A can be found frequently in accordance with the degree of the program support every time. If clustering in accordance with the number of the occurred programs every time will be missing the frequent in the 6-8 time segments.

The example of analysis of Cycle Association Rules  B. Define the number of the cyclic time segment In text [2-5] there is another issue, how many segments is  divided in a cycle is determined by man.Although in the text [4][5] the length of time segment of the cyclic association rules? model cluster automatically in accordance with the number of affairs , but this cluster is got from result of the Fisher arithmetic in the identified number of time segments by man. This ignores the cluster number which is another indicator to determine the effect of clustering. However, the choice of the cluster number is according to the actual situation of detail data rather than decided by man.

C. The choice of basic arithmetic In text [2-5][10] the existing Cyclic Association Rules are  based on Apriori arithmetic, Text [1] : cyclic association rules discovery arithmetic with temporal constraints. They all have problems such as existence of a very large set of options, match models and database services to your search costing lot of time, high consumption of resources, and low operating efficiency and so on.

D. The idea to solve the existing problems The Arithmetic of Discover Cyclic Association Rules  Based on Difference Sequence Arithmetic Clustering(CARCFP)  consists of two phases: Difference Sequence Arithmetic Clustering (DSAC) and Cyclic FP-tree(CFP-tree). First of all, time series vector made up of the support of the items use the clustering based on difference sequence arithmetic [7] and DB Index [9]to determine each time segment dynamically in the Cyclic association rules. Using DB Index [9]to control the number of cluster can achieve the best results. We use DSAC to discover the useful association rules if it is possible. CFP- tree which is based on FP-tree to discover the Cyclic association Rules for the database on each time segment of the cyclic. FP-tree is superior to the Apriori arithmetic. CFP-tree based on the conditions of the cyclical nature of FP-tree crop technology increases in the efficiency of the arithmetic substantially. The theory and experiment shows the CFP-tree arithmetic of the cyclic association rules based on FP-tree is much better than the arithmetic of the cyclic association rules based on Apriori in the efficiency both in time and space.



II. DSAC  A. Choose the feature point of the time segment?s data In this paper, the feature point of the time segment?s data is  defined in details bellow:  1) the support of every item occurred every moment in one cyclic can constitute each one-dimensional weight of the time series vector ei. N-dimensional time series vector ei=<x1,?,xn>, each dimension of ei range from all real numbers of the closed interval[0,1].

2) The time series vector sequence consisted of the time series vector is expressed as E={ei|i=1,?,m},the length of the time series vector sequence Lend(E)=m,Time(E) is to be a cyclic. The time interval between the any two time series vector of the E is equal, Granularity (E) is an accurate data..

In the paper, the DSAC arithmetic is mainly clustering the time series vector sequence E of the first cyclic.

B. The preparation before the time series vector is clustering We are in face of the problem that how many kinds of the  time series vectors can be categored in a cyclic to achieve the best clustering results before the time series vector is clustering. In another word, what are the  indicators to determine the best clustering results.

1) Clustering validity function[11-13]  we need clustering validity function to control the  number of the cluster to solve the above problem. Here we use DB Index to control the number of the cluster. The smaller the value of the DB Index?the better is effect of the cluster class.

2) Optimization of the DSAC arithmetic---decrease the research range of the best number of the cluster Copt  There are n time series vector e in a cyclic ,we can choose the number of the cluster e from 2 to n, apply DB Index and Difference Sequence Arithmetic to determine the best optimal class number of the cluster Copt. If the research range of the cluster class e is from 2 to n, in another way 2<= Copt<=n. So     the theory in the text [14] is applied to this paper,So the paper take rules: nc ?max  , so that  2<= Copt<= n .

C. Difference Sequence Arithmetic [7] Each moment of the time series vector ei in the first cyclic  is clustered, this vector with time parameter is an ordered sample, we can use Fisher Arithmetic. Text [4][5] use this arithmetic to cluster the number of the items every moment.

But Fisher Arithmetic doesn?t consider the order of the sample when it is in the calculation of the diameter of each category.

About this order we can take Difference Sequence Arithmetic to cluster the time series vector ei. Difference Sequence Arithmetic not only consider the order of the sample with time parameter ,but also calculate simply and the result is intuitive.

D. DSAC Difference Sequence Arithmetic can not determine that how  many classes can be categoried to be the best optimal class, so we need DB Index to decide the optimal class of the cluster.

The paper combines these two methods to cluster the time series vector ei in the first cyclic so that we can determine the distribution law of the feature point of the time segment?s data, and then to determine each time segment of the Cyclic Association Rules.

DSAC Arithmetic:  1) Step 1:calculate m-1 difference degree g[i] of the time series vector sequence with m time series vector in a cyclic and m-2 second difference degree h[i],then they can form corresponding the difference degree and the minor difference degree of the array.

2) Step 2:because the class of the time series vector sequence E is from 2 to m . So we find m split point. In the second difference degree sequence array, we can find the max h[i], then determine the corresponding split point , then find the h[i]max in the remaining h[i] and determine the corresponding split point, do as this. Avoiding to scan the found h[i] repeatedly we can sort. Exchange the h[i]max and h[0] in the first place. Then exchange the second maximum h[i] and h[1] in the second place ,always do this until the m >h[i].

3) Step 3:because of sort the initial position of each h[i] is disrupted, if we want to find h[i] to determine the split point, we must write down the initial position. h[i] contains two components of the structure variable. h[i].data is the second defference degree. The position of h[i].place store the initial position i.

4) 1st step of the step 2:to determine one h[i],according to h[i].place take advantage of the formula we can determine the position of the split point k_wei, then put k_wei into the corresponding position in Fen with sort from min to max. when k_wei is in Fen it still keep the order.

5) 2nd step of step 2:when a new split point is determined, take the new Fen and INDEX(e.Fen)to calculate the corresponding DBe, then compare DBe and DB*. If DBe < DB*, DBe covers DB*,at the same time we can find DBemin when Fen run end. The smaller DBe is, the better effect of the  cluster. Of course, the corresponding list Fen is the optimal class.



III. CFP-TREE We use DSAC Arithmetic to cluster the time series vector  which is consisted of the support of the occurred items every moment, and then determine each time segment of the Cyclic Association Rules. After this we can find useful cyclic association rules in each time segment of a cyclic.

A. Two method to discover the frequent items of the cyclic 1) Method 1: at each time segment of the any cyclic  frequent items exist a corresponding frequent item to contain it.

So we only scoop frequent itemsets of each time segment in one cyclic, then put this frequent items and services array of the time segment of the other cyclic into confrontation, so that we can find all cyclic frequent items. First we can build FP-tree in each time segment of the first cyclic, use FP-growth to produce frequent items of each time segment of the first cyclic, and then put these frequent items and services of corresponding time segment into confrontation to produce all cyclic frequent items.

2) Method 2: we can do optimization of the method 2.

According to the theorem 1, we can build FP-tree in each time segment of the first cyclic, start from the list of the cyclic frequent items L, use cyclical crop technology based on FP-tree to produce all cyclic frequent items ,and then discover the Lusty Cyclic Association Rules. It is CFP-tree.

B. Cyclical crop technology based on FP-tree The detail idea of cyclical crop technology based on FP-  tree: do improvement of the FP-growth of the text [8], add the function to discover the cyclic frequent itemsets. On condition of model ? on FP-growth to do cyclical crop. The set combined with model ?and FP-tree(fo example, ?is {kma} , the condition of ?is FP-tree {(f:3,b:3)}|kma, soform the set {{fkma},{bkma}}) is compared with all services of corresponding time segment of the other cyclics, crop the itemset which its cyclical support < Smin in the set. When the FP-tree in each time segment [sj,ej] of first cyclic is finished ,the whole cyclic frequent itemsets is done.

We set the root on Figure 2 as an example, set Mis model condition of ma which involves items., under ma there are mac and maf MM ?? {f}{c} ? , so we can know from the theorem 3 that the cyclic support of ma in Figure 2 , the cyclic support of all other mac and maf. so it is the mac and maf. In the child tree which take ma as root, the cyclic support of ma is max.If ma is not cyclical frequent items, except the root ma, is not the cyclical frequent itemset. If we use cyclical crop technology based on FP-tree of method 2 ,only root ma do need to be compared once to services array of the corresponding time segment of the other cyclic, so the child tree will not be formed in Figure 3. Compared to the method 1 ,method 2 can save the cost of child tree on condition of root ma, at the same time it can save the cost of the cyclical confrontation. On the condition that ma is not cyclical frequent items, method 2 can directly forms.Figure 3. Method 2 can control the extent of tree of the cyclic frequent items and decrease the research space.

Discover the Lusty Cyclic Association Rules All the cyclic frequent items at every time segment [si,ei] of  each cyclic can directly form Lusty Cyclic Association Rules.

In details, on all not empty sets a in every cyclic frequent items L, if support(L)/support(a)>=cmin, the Lusty Cyclic Association Rules a?(L-a)[C,si,ei,sa?(L-a),ca?(L-a)].



IV. ARITHMETIC ANALYSIS AND THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENT  1) Hardware / software platform of experimental test and the parameters:S240XP Server(double Intel Xeon MP CPU, 1GB Memory. Programming language VC++6.0,Operating system Windows2000AdvanceServer,Database Oracle9i.

2) The Data Set of experimental:Gathering 600000 pretreatment Data Set of high-dimensional industrial authenticity each day. One day is one cyclic. Time Series vector Sequence E experienced the time span Time(E)=a day.

Granularity (E)=one second. The types of the gathering sample Lend(E)=86400, so Cmax= 294Lend(E) ? .people can get Copt     =95 after DSAC algorithm cluster. Copt =95 is feasible after the estimation of the validity function DB Index.

Figure 4 shows the number of the items based on CARCFP are larger than those based on Fisher at the same min support and total time length. It proposes that CARCFP algorithm is optimizer than the cyclic association rules model of the text [4][5]. Because the algorithm of the text [4][5] can discover more cyclic association rules than the algorithm of paper [2], so CARCFP algorithm is optimizer than the paper[2].

Comparison between the CARCFP and the number of the discovering cyclic frequent items of the cyclic association rules model  Figure 5 shows: The costing time of the two arithmetic is decreased with the increase of the min support. Because the higher the min support is , the more the items are out. CARCFP takes more less time than the Arithmetic of the cyclic association rules based on Apriori.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS The CARCFP can discover useful cyclic association rules  as many as possible. Time and space efficiency get great improved when it is compared with the arithmetic of discover cyclic association rules based on Apriori. The paper analyzed and summarized some inherent nature and laws of the cycle association rules, and the experiment has reflected it. All experiments indicate that CARCFP is applied to analysis the cyclical database of the industrial production. The actual research results of CARCFP as these: The system of industrial embedded information collection and decision-making has been put into pre-operational phase. These above provide a certain reference on practical application of cyclic association rules and further theoretical research. However, there is another more complex problem of the cyclic association rules waiting for us to do Further exploration and research, that is the field of the maintenance of cyclic association rules. this problem is about incremental update of cyclic association rules. It needs to consider the number of diversification of items in the database of each cyclic and the threshold of cyclic support.
