A Method of Predicting Users` Behaviors Based on Inter-transaction Association Rules

Abstract?Association rules is one of web data mining methods, taking advantage of the knowledge acquired through the web log and finding the user?s navigational behavior. Recently, nearly all researches of association rules are based on intra- transaction. They all focus on the relationship among web pages. But user is the center of all the internet services, and they should be given more considered. In this paper, a new method of predicting users` behaviors based on inter- transaction association rules is proposed. Through the improved Mafia algorithm, the maximum frequent itemsets with CUI can be found. We generate the inter-transaction association rules, discovering the relationship among users, predicting next pages the user visited. Experimental results prove that this method provides more accurate prediction results than former researches, and users will get more of the content they want.

I.  INTRODUCTION In the Internet, the most important thing for a web site  manager is how to make users who visit the web site with a comfortable feeling [1]. While the most important thing is how to get he wants conveniently for users. Web usage mining [2] based on traditional data mining technology which is used for discovering users` interesting patterns and browsing behaviors. It can satisfy all the needs above.

Association rules is a web usage mining method which describes the potential association relationships between users and pages. There?re two kinds of association rule -- intra-transaction association rules and inter-transaction association rules [3]. Opposite to the former one, focuses on the relationship among the web pages in one user browsing session [4], the latter one can make predictions in different browsing sessions. Considering users must be the center of all the network activities, we commence seeking for the relationship among users.

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we discuss the background of study and the related works. In section 3, a new method is described in details. In section 4, Empirical results and analyses are presented. Section 5 presents the conclusions and our future works.



II. BACKGROUND  A. Basic Description of Web Association Rules A complete statement of a web usage mining database  included a set of n users, U = {u1, u2, ?, un} and a set of m web pages transactions, P = {p1, p2, ?, pm}. We set pi as a transaction and the users who have visited pi set as its items.

Each transaction marked by a TID (Transaction ID) number for recognizing simply.

A formulation is raised: pi = < (u1, w (u1)), (u2, w (u2)), ?, (un, w(un))>.

When a user visits the web site, he or she may leave browsing history. As the formulation above, w (un) is a weight value. If it equals 1, the user un has visited the web page pi; if it equals 0, the user hasn?t visited the web page.

This paper proposed a method that mines inter- transaction association rules among different users who visited the same pages. Through analyzing the visiting history, it can predict what the user might be visited next time.

B. Definitions and Properties For mining inter-transaction association rules, related  definitions and properties are given as follows.

Definition 1 (Sliding Window): Inter-transaction  association rules are generated from different transactions. It uses the data from the whole database, no doubt that the computing is very complex. So sliding window technology [7] can be used to control the data flow. Sliding window W is a block of n continuous data, the amount of blocks named w (the number of sub-windows). As figure 1, w = 4.

Definition 2 (CUI): When maximum frequent itemsets have been generated, CUI(common user itemset) is an intersection which recorded the TID, those items in a transaction of the original data has been occurred at the same time.

Definition 3(Support): The support of association rules YX equals the support of YX ? .  If support value is  large, the association rule is important, otherwise it is useless.

The formulations are:  || )()(sup  D XcountXport =   )|(sup)(sup YXportYXport =  2009 Sixth Web Information Systems and Applications Conference  DOI 10.1109/WISA.2009.18   2009 Sixth Web Information Systems and Applications Conference  DOI 10.1109/WISA.2009.18      Figure 1.  The definition of sliding window  Definition 4(Confidence): The confidence of association rules YX  can be determined whether the rule is credible.

The formulation is:  )(sup )(sup)(  Xport YXportYXconfidence ?=  Definition 5(Maximum Frequent Itemset): X which includes some items was a set in database D. When  supmin)(sup ?Xport , X is the frequent itemset. When X without any supersets, it can be called maximum frequent itemset.

Property 1: Any proper subsets of frequent itemsets are not maximum frequent itemsets.

Definition 6(Inter-transaction association rules): An inter-transaction association rule YX  can be defined as follows:  1. ., ???? YX  2. .1,)0( uiXei ????  3. .0,1,)( ????? juiYjei

III. THE INTER-TRANSACTION ASSOCIATION RULES BASED ON MAXIMUM FREQUENT ITEMSET  The aim of web usage mining is to supply better services to users. We will achieve it through 3 steps. They are data preparation, model discovery and association rules generation.

A. Data Preparation The data from web logs can?t be used directly. This step  is important to the accuracy of the result [8, 9], and it?s necessary for a better discovering result of inter-transaction association rules. It filters the redundant data, and then transforms the data format.

B. Pattern Discovery Through the improved Mafia algorithm, the MFI  (maximum frequent itemset) and CUI (common user itemset)  can be generated. We converse intra-transaction to inter- transaction, and analyze the inclusion relation of different items in sliding window. Users? interesting was found in the final.

Steps are as follows: Step 1: Find out and store the MFI in appropriate format.

In the Internet, the information is huge. So Mafia which  can manipulate huge data efficiently was chosen. However, it can?t record the TID intersection of which items in original database occurs at the same transaction. So we improved it.

Now it can not only find the MFI, but also stores the useful TID intersection, which we called CUI.

Algorithm 1: Generating MFI and the relative CUI with  improved Mafia algorithm: Input: The whole database.

Output: MFI and CUI.

input the database ///Mafia //Creating DFS space and candidate itemsets tree Simple(Current node C, MFI) {......  } //Three kinds of pruning mechanisms //1.Parent Equivalence Pruning PEP(Current node C, MFI) { ?? } //2.HUTMFI Superset Pruning HUTMFI(Current node C, MFI) {......} //3.FHUT - Frequent Head-Union-Tail FHUT(node C, MFI, Boolean Is HUT) {......} MFI found.

///Generating the CUI for each transaction in MFI.

//Acquiring the TID occurs in original database.

read from the original database; for (get a line) { store each(transnum1,Tidset1) in table1; } end for //Creating CUI read from the file included maximum frequent itemsets  information ; for (get a line from MFI) { split every number in every MFI; find (transnum2, Tidset2) in table1; store (transnum2, Tidset2); //Intersect intersect (transnum2) named CUI; //(Tidset2,CUI) is the every transaction in MFI and  the relative CUI store (Tidset2,CUI) } end for CUI is the key to mine inter-transaction association rules.

Because of comparing the inclusion relation of CUIs, we can find the association rules.

Step 2: Transforming the MFI from intra-transaction to  inter-transaction.

Through the continuous moving of sliding window, the  value of CUI has changed by pruning method. When it cannot satisfy the pruning criterion, it will be eliminated.

Finally, the user pattern was generated.

The beginning of each sliding window is a nonempty transaction. Assuming that t represents a TID which is stored in CUI, n was the number of a sub-window. If t appears in nth sub-window, t must exist in the sliding window which started at t-n+1. If t-n+1 satisfied the following pruning methods, we eliminated the transaction included t-n+1.

Pruning criterion: 1. If the item in TIDset is less than 0, equal to 0, beyond  the max transaction or contains nothing.

2. If two TIDsets included each other, only leave the set  which contained another.

Algorithm 2: Transforming the MFI to inter-transaction  MFI, for generating the user pattern.

Input: MFI and CUI which brought by algorithm 1.

Output: Inter-transaction MFI and user pattern.

read from the result of algorithm 1; for(1 n w); for(Tidset, Transaction num2) { New Transaction num = t ? n +1; Add New_Transaction num to New Intra-transaction  Maximum Frequent Itemsets; } ///Pruning method for(each New Transaction) //Method 1 if(New Transaction num  0 || New Transaction num=  || New Transaction num > Max Tidset number ) delete New Transaction num; //Method 2 if(New Tidset 1 ? New Tidset 2) delete New Tidset 1; end for With the methods above, the inter-transaction MFI has  been discovered, and then the inter-transaction association rules can be discovered.

C. Inter-transaction Association Rules Generation The inter-transaction MFI was found in step 2, giving a  minconf value and finding out the contain relation between sub-window[1] and the posterior sub-windows (see table 3), the association rules could be build if some items were contained in other items [4]. Otherwise, we run the pruning mechanisms till the last sub-window [10].

For example, in figure 3, the rate of inclusive relation between sub-window[2] and sub-window[1] is 67%, this value is greater than the value of mincof -- 60%, then the association rule can be generated as sub-window[1]  sub- window[2].



IV. EXPERIMENTS RESULTS The database used in experiments includes 17 different  tags in a website.

Firstly, the format of this database was as table 1, after  data preparation, the format is adjusted as table 2.

TABLE I.  THE ORIGINAL FORMAT  Users Web pages U1 Homepage, Homepage, ?  U2 Weather, ? U3 Tech, Weather, Weather, ?  U4 Living, ? U5 Homepage, ?  ? ?  TABLE II.   FORMAT AFTER TRANSFORMED  Web pages Users Homepage U1, U5, U7, U11, ?  Weather U2, U3, ? Tech U3, U10, ?  Politics U4, U10 , ?  Living U6, U8, U9, U10, ? ? ?  Next, MFI is generated by using the data in table 2.

Assuming sliding window number is 4, the minsup is 40%.

Using algorithm 1, MFI and CUI can be found. Then we transform intra-transaction MFI to inter-transaction MFI.

The result can be seen as table 3.

TABLE III.  USING SLIDING WINDOW TRANSFORMS THE MAXIMUM FREQUENT ITEMSETS FROM INTRA-TRANSACTION TO INTER-  TRANSACTION  No. Users(sub-window) CUI  1 U5, U4, U9, U8, U3, U12, U6, U14, U13 [1] 2 3 4 5 7 14  2 U1, U12, U6, U13 [1] 3 4 5 6 9 10  3 U7, U10, U4, U15, U8, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1] 1 2 3 4 5 7  4 U11, U4, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1] 1 2 3 4 13 14  5 U4, U2, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1] 1 2 4 5 7 13  6 U16, U12, U6, U14, U13 [1] 4 5 6 7 10 13  7 U1, U12, U6, U13 [2] 2 3 4 5 8 9  8 U16, U12, U6, U14, U13 [2] 3 4 5 6 9 12  9 U1, U12, U6, U13 [3] 1 2 3 4 7 8  10 U16, U12, U6, U14, U13 [3] 2 3 4 5 8 11  11 U16, U12, U6, U14, U13 [4] 1 2 3 4 7 10  The minsup is 40%. The minconf is 60%, we named it as a fault-tolerance value, if the rate of right recommending pages above or equal 60%, that means the recommending results would satisfy the users` expectation.

For example, from column of CUI, there are 67% of same items in line 7 are included in line 1. This value is above the minconf. So one association rule can be generated as U5, U4, U9, U8, U3, U12, U6, U14, U13 [1]  U1, U12, U6, U13 [2], and the confidence value is 67%.

According to the method mentioned above, all the association rules can be generated as follows:  U5, U4, U9, U8, U3, U12, U6, U14, U13 [1]  U1, U12, U6, U13 [2], the confidence value is 67%.

U7, U10, U4, U15, U8, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1]  U1, U12, U6, U13 [2], the confidence value is 67%.

U1, U12, U6, U13 [1]  U16, U12, U6, U14, U13 [2], the confidence value is 83%.

U5, U4, U9, U8, U3, U12, U6, U14, U13 [1]  U1, U12, U6, U13 [3], the confidence value is 63%.

U7, U10, U4, U15, U8, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1]  U1, U12, U6, U13 [3], the confidence value is 83%.

U11, U4, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1]  U1, U12, U6, U13 [3], the confidence value is 67%.

U4, U2, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1]  U1, U12, U6, U13 [3], the confidence value is 67%.

U5, U4, U9, U8, U3, U12, U6, U14, U13 [1]  U16, U12, U6, U14, U13 [3], the confidence value is 67%.

U7, U10, U4, U15, U8, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1]  U16, U12, U6, U14, U13 [3], the confidence value is 67%.

U5, U4, U9, U8, U3, U12, U6, U14, U13 [1]  U16, U12, U6, U14, U13 [4], the confidence value is 67%.

U7, U10, U4, U15, U8, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1]  U16, U12, U6, U14, U13 [4], the confidence value is 83%.

U11, U4, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1]  U16, U12, U6, U14, U13 [4], the confidence value is 67%.

U4, U2, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1]  U16, U12, U6, U14, U13 [4], the confidence value is 67%.

If the right sides of association rules are the same, keep the bigger confidence value ones, abandon the smaller.

Finally, the inter-transaction association rules are:  U1, U12, U6, U13 [1]  U16, U12, U6, U14, U13 [2], the confidence value is 83%.

U7, U10, U4, U15, U8, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1]  U1, U12, U6, U13 [3], the confidence value is 83%.

U7, U10, U4, U15, U8, U3, U12, U14, U13 [1]  U16, U12, U6, U14, U13 [4], the confidence value is 83%.

From the first of the three rules, we can tell that when U16 visits website, he/she may be interested in the content that U1, U12, U6, U13 like.



V. CONCLUSION This paper proposes a new method based on improved  Mafia algorithm, when it generates MFI, it also generates CUI. Using the inclusive relation between CUIs, the inter- transaction association rules can be found. This method is easier and much more efficient compared to the traditional association rules. It can not only recommend more pages to users, but also inherited the superiority of Mafia algorithm which deals with huge database efficiently.
