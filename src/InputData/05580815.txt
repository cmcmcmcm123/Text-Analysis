Keywords: Adaptive learning systems; Data mining; Concept maps  1. Introduction  In recent years, some researchers focused on the research topic of adaptive learning systems [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. In [2], Bai and Chen presented a method for evaluating students? learning achievement using fuzzy membership functions and fuzzy rules. In [3], Bai and Chen presented a method for automatically constructing grade membership functions of fuzzy rules for students? evaluation. In [4], Bai and Chen presented a method for automatically constructing concept maps based on fuzzy rules for adapting learning systems. In [6], Lee et al. presented a method to automatically construct concepts maps for conceptual diagnosis. In [5], Bai and Chen presented a method to automatically construct concept maps based on data mining techniques to overcome the drawbacks of Lee et al.?s method [6].

In this paper, we present a new method to automatically construct concept maps for adaptive learning systems. First, we calculate the counter values, where the counter values indicate the answer-consistence between any two questions.

Then, base on four kinds of association rules, we apply the Apriori Algorithm [1] to mine some information. Finally, we calculate the relevance degree between any two concepts to construct concepts maps for adaptive learning systems. The  proposed method provides us with a useful way to construct concept maps in adaptive learning systems.

2. A new method for automatically constructing concept maps  In this section, we present a new method to automatically construct concept maps for adaptive learning systems. Assume that there are n learners ,,, 21 ?SS nS , there are m questions ,,, 21 ?QQ mQ , and there are p concepts ,,, 21 ?CC pC ,  then we can transform the test portfolio of the learners and the conceptual weight relationships to the matrix G and the matrix QC, respectively.

Let Qx denote the xth question, where 1 ? x ? m, and let Sz denote the zth student, where 1 ? z ? n. Then, we can get the grade matrix G, shown as follows:    ,        n  mnmm  n  n  m  SSS  ggg  ggg ggg  Q  Q Q  G  ?  ? ????  ? ?  ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  =    where gxz?[0,1], gxz = 1 denotes the student Sz gets the right answer in question Qx, and gxz = 0 denotes the student Sz has a wrong answer in question Qx, where 1 ? x ? m and 1 ? z ? n.

In the same way, we can construct the questions-concept matrix QC, shown as follows:  ,        p  mpmm  p  p  m  CCC  qcqcqc  qcqcqc qcqcqc  Q  Q Q  QC  ?  ? ????  ? ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  =          where qcst denotes the degree of relevance of question Qs with respect to concept Ct and 0 ? qcst ? 1. The proposed method to construct concept maps in adaptive learning systems is now presented as follows: Setp 1:  Base on the grade matrix G, calculate the counter value ),( yx QQCount  between the questions Qx and Qy by the matrix G, where Qx = [gx1 gx2 ? gxn], Qy = [gy1 gy2 ? gyn], and  ),( yx QQCount  = ,)(  ? =  n  k ykxk gg          (1)  where the counter value ),( yx QQCount  indicates the  answer-consistence between the questions Qx and Qy; denotes the XNOR operator. If ),( yx QQCount  ? n  40%, then consider four kinds of association rules based on Qx and Qy as shown in Step 2. Otherwise, we ignore it, where n denotes the number of students. For example, if Qx = [0  0 0  1  1] and Qy = [0  0  0  0  1], then Count(Qx, Qy) = Count([0  0  0  1  1], [0  0  0  0  1]) = (0  0) + (0  0) + (0  0) + (1  0) + (1  1) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 4.

Setp 2: Based on the counter values ),( yx QQCount  obtained in Step 1, consider four kinds of association rules, shown as follows:  (1) If the learner gets the right answer in question Qx, then he/she also gets the right answer in question Qy.

(2) If the learner gets the right answer in question Qy, then he/she also gets the right answer in question Qx,  (3) If the learner has the wrong answer in question Qx, then he/she also has the wrong answer in question Qy,  (4) If the learner has the wrong answer in question Qy, then he/she also has the wrong answer in question Qx.

Calculate the confidence cfxy of the association rule Qx ? Qy based on four kinds of association rules, shown as follows:  cfxy = )(  ),(  x  yx  QSup QQSup ,                        (2)  where ?cfxy? denotes the confidence of the association rule ?Qx ? Qy?, ?Sup(Qx,Qy)? denotes the support of the 2-itemset (Qx, Qy), and ?Sup(Qx)? denotes the support of the 1-itemset Qx. Assume that the minimum confidence in this example is 0.75, then if the confidence of an association rule is smaller than 0.75, we delete this association rule. For example, Table 1 shows the confidences of the association rules ?Qx ? Qy? and ?Qy ? Qx?, respectively, where they denotes that ?if the question Qx is correctly learned by the learner, then the  question Qy is also correctly learned by the learner? and ?if the question Qy is correctly learned by the learner, then the question Qx is also correctly learned by the learner?, respectively. (i.e., Correct to Correct)  TABLE 1. ASSOCIATION RULES (CORRECT TO CORRECT)  Association Rules Confidence Preserve or Delete Qx ? Qy 0.5 Delete Qy ? Qx 1 Preserve   Table 2 shows the confidences of the association rule  ?Qx ? Qy? and ?Qy ? Qx?, respectively, where they denotes that ?if the question Qx is incorrectly learned by the learner, then the question Qy is also incorrectly learned by the learner? and ?if the question Qy is incorrectly learned by the learner, then the question Qx is also incorrectly learned by the learner?, respectively. (i.e., Incorrect to Incorrect)  TABLE 2. ASSOCIATION RULES (INCORRECT TO INCORRECT)  Association Rules Confidence Preserve or Delete Qx ? Qy 1 Preserve Qy ? Qx 0.75 Preserve   Setp 3: Create a new question-concept QC? from the question-concept matrix QC base on two cases, shown as follows:  Case 1: If there are more than one nonzero values in a concept Ct?s column for all questions Qs from matrix QC, where 1 ? s ? m, m is the number of questions, then we calculate the qc?st , shown as follows:  ? =  = m  u ut  st st  qc  qcqc   '                       (3)  Case 2: Otherwise, we let qc?st = qcst,                        (4)  where qc?st denotes the degree of relevance of question Qs with respect to concept Ct of matrix QC?, 1 ? s ? m, 1 ? t ? p, m is the number of questions, p is the number of concepts and 0 ? qc?st ? 1, qcst denotes the degree of relevance of question Qs with respect to concept Ct of matrix QC, 1 ? s ? m, 1 ? t ? p, m is the number of questions, p is the number of concepts  and 0 ? qcst ? 1 and? =  m  u utqc   denotes the total degree of  relevance of concept Ct in all questions. Assume that the association rule ?Qx ? Qy? is based on ?incorrectly learned to incorrectly learned? and it?s concept relationship is ?Ci ? Cj?, where Ci denotes a concept appearing in the question Qx, Cj denotes a concept appearing in the question Qy, 1 ? i ? p, 1 ? j ? p and i ? j. Because ?P?Q? and ?~Q ? ~P? are          logically equivalent, if the association rule Qx ? Qy is based on ?correctly learned to correctly learned?, then it?s concept relationship should be ?Cj ? Ci?. Then, we calculate the relevance degree ( )  yx QQji CC ??rev  between concepts Ci and  Cj from the relationship Qx ? Qy, shown as follows: ( )  yx QQji CC ??rev  = qcxi ? qc?yj ? cfxy ,      (5)  where ? ( ) yx QQji  CC ??rev ? denotes the relevance degree of the  relationship ?Ci ? Cj? from the relationship ?Qx ? Qy?, ( ) [ ],1,0rev ?? ? yx QQji CC  Ci denotes a concept in question Qx,  Cj denotes a concept in question Qy, qcxi denotes the degree of relevance of question Qx with respect to concept Ci of matrix QC, and 0 ? qcxi ? 1 and qc?yj denotes the degree of relevance of question Qy with respect to concept Cj of matrix QC?, and 0 ? qcyj?? 1 and cfxy denotes the confidence of the association rule ?Qx ? Qy?.

Step 4: Let  ? = Min(qcst),                       (6) where ? denotes the threshold value of the relevance degree ??[0,1], qcst denotes the degree of relevance of question Qs with respect to concept Ct of matrix QC, 1 ? s ? m, 1 ? t ? p, m is the number of questions, p is the number of concepts, and 0 ? qcst ? 1. If ( )  yx QQji CC ??rev  is smaller than ?, then  we calculate ?: ? = Ni + Nj,                       (7)  where ? denotes the summation of Ni and Nj, Ni denotes the number of the questions which have concept Ci, Nj denotes the number of the questions which have concept Cj. If ? < m ? 50%, then we preserve the relevance degree  ( ) yx QQji  CC ??rev even though it is smaller than threshold  value ?, where m is the number of total questions. Because question Qx and question Qy are the unusual questions which contain the concept Ci and concept Cj, respectively, we consider the relationship ?Ci ? Cj? is more important between Qx and Qy.

Step 5: Construct the concepts-relationship between any two concepts Ci and Cj. If ( )  yx QQji CC ??rev  is larger than ? or ?  < m ? 50%, then we set the relationship form the concept Ci to the concept Cj with the relevance degree, where the concepts-relationship from Ci to Cj means that the concept Ci should be the pre-required concept of the concept Cj.

Step 6: If there are more than one concepts- relationship between concepts Ci and Cj, then we only keep the concept-relationship with the maximum relevance degree and delete the others.

3. An example  Assume that the grade matrix G and the questions-concept matrix QC are shown as follows:   ,         SSSSS  Q Q Q Q Q  G  ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  =      .

03.004.03.0 005.005.0        CCCCC  Q Q Q Q Q  QC  ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  =    [Step 1] Based on the grade matrix G, we can calculate the counter values ),( yx QQCount between any two questions Qx and Qy, where 1 ? x ? 5, 1 ? y ? 5 and x ? y, shown as follows: Count(Q1, Q2) = Count([0  0  0  1  1], [0  0  0  0  1]) = (0  0) + (0  0) + (0  0) + (1  0) + (1  1) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 4, Count(Q1, Q3) = Count([0  0  0  1  1], [0  0  0  0  0]) = 3, Count(Q1, Q4) = Count([0  0  0  1  1], [1  1  0  0  0]) = 1, Count(Q1, Q5) = Count([0  0  0  1  1], [1  1  1  0  0]) = 0, Count(Q2, Q3) = Count([0  0  0  0  1], [0  0  0  0  0]) = 4, Count(Q2, Q4) = Count([0  0  0  0  1], [1  1  0  0  0]) = 2, Count(Q2, Q5) = Count([0  0  0  0  1], [1  1  1  0  0]) = 1, Count(Q3, Q4) = Count([0  0  0  0  0], [1  1  0  0  0]) = 3, Count(Q3, Q5) = Count([0  0  0  0  0], [1  1  1  0  0]) = 2, Count(Q4, Q5) = Count([1  1  0  0  0], [1  1  1  0  0]) = 4.

We keep the counter values which are not smaller than 40% of n, where n is the number of students. Because the number of students is 5 (i.e., n = 5), we can see that 5 ? 40% = 2.

[Step 2] Based on the counter values obtained in Step 1, we consider four kinds of association rules. Table  and Table show the support of the 1-itemset of the questions that the learner gets the right answer and the support of the 1-itemset of the questions that the learners has a wrong answer, respectively.

TABLE 3. THE SUPPORT OF THE1-ITEMSET OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE STUDENT GETS THE RIGHT ANSWER IN THE QUESTIONS  1-Itemset Support Q1 2 Q2 1 Q3 0 Q4 2 Q5 3                TABLE 4. THE SUPPORT OF THE 1-ITEMSET OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE STUDENT HAS A WRONG ANSWER IN THE QUESTIONS  1-Itemset Support Q1 3 Q2 4 Q3 5 Q4 3 Q5 2   Table  and Table  show the support of the 2-itemset of  the questions that the learner gets the right answer and the support of the 2-itemset of the questions that the learners has the wrong answer, respectively.

TABLE 5. THE SUPPORT OF THE 2-ITEMSET OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE STUDENT GETS THE RIGHT ANSWER IN THE QUESTIONS  1-Itemset Support {Q1,Q2} 1 {Q1,Q3} 0 {Q1,Q4} 0 {Q1,Q5} 0 {Q2,Q3} 0 {Q2,Q4} 0 {Q2,Q5} 0 {Q3,Q4} 0 {Q3,Q5} 0 {Q4,Q5} 2    TABLE 6. THE SUPPORT OF THE 2-ITEMSET OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE STUDENT HAS THE WRONG ANSWER IN THE QUESTIONS  1-Itemset Support {Q1,Q2} 3 {Q1,Q3} 3 {Q1,Q4} 1 {Q1,Q5} 0 {Q2,Q3} 4 {Q2,Q4} 2 {Q2,Q5} 1 {Q3,Q4} 3 {Q3,Q5} 2 {Q4,Q5} 2   Based on Table , Table , Table  and Table , we can  calculate the confidences of the association rules. The minimum confidence we used in this example is 0.75. If the confidence of the association rule is smaller than 0.75, then we delete the association rule. The results are shown as follows: (i) For ,4),( 21 =QQCount  we can get the following results:     (Correct to Correct) Association Rules Confidence Preserve or Delete  Q1 ? Q2 0.5 Delete Q2 ?

Q2 0.667 Delete   (v) For 3),( 43 =QQCount , we can get the following results:  (Correct to Correct) Association Rules Confidence Preserve or Delete  Q3 ? Q4 0 Delete Q4 ? Q3 0 Delete  (Incorrect to Incorrect) Association Rules Confidence Preserve or Delete  Q3 ? Q4 0.6 Delete Q4 ?

Q4 1 Preserve  [Step 3] Based on Eqs (3) and (4), we can get matrix QC?, shown as follows:  ,    03.00286.0167.0 0000278.0 005.0714.00 0000555.0  '       CCCCC  Q Q Q Q Q  QC  ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  =  and based on Eq (5) after calculating the relevance degree ( )  yx QQji CC ??rev  between concepts Ci and Cj from the  relationship Qx ? Qy, the results are shown as follows: (i) For Q2 ? Q1: Based on the correct to correct relationship,  we can get ( )21rev CC ?  = 1 ? 0.714 ? 1 = 0.714.

(ii) For Q1 ? Q2: Based on the incorrect to incorrect relationship, we can get  ( )21rev CC ?  = 1 ? 0.714 ? 1 = 0.714.

(iii) For Q2 ? Q1: Based on the incorrect to incorrect  relationship, we can get ( )12rev CC ?  = 1 ? 0.555 ? 0.75 = 0.417.

(iv) For Q1 ? Q3: Based on the incorrect to incorrect relationship, we can get ( )31rev CC ?  = 1 ? 0.5 ? 1 = 0.5.

(v) For Q2 ? Q3: Based on the incorrect to incorrect relationship, we can get  ( )12rev CC ?  = 1 ? 0.278 ? 1 = 0.278, ( )32rev CC ?  = 1 ? 0.5 ? 1 = 0.5.

(vi) For Q3 ? Q2: Based on the incorrect to incorrect relationship, we can get ( )21rev CC ?  = 0.5 ? 0.714 ? 0.8 = 0.286,  ( )23rev CC ?  = 0.5 ? 0.714 ? 0.8 = 0.286.

(vii) For Q4 ? Q3: Based on the incorrect to incorrect  relationship, we can get ( )31rev CC ?  = 0.3 ? 0.5 ? 1 = 0.15, ( )12rev CC ?  = 0.4 ? 0.278 ? 1 = 0.111,  ( )32rev CC ?  = 0.4 ? 0.5 ? 1 = 0.2,  ( )14rev CC ?  = 0.3 ? 0.278 ? 1 = 0.083, ( )34rev CC ?  = 0.3 ? 0.5 ? 1 = 0.15.

(viii) For Q5 ? Q3: Based on the incorrect to incorrect  relationship, we can get ( )15rev CC ?  = 1 ? 0.278 ? 1 = 0.278, ( )35rev CC ?  = 1 ? 0.5 ? 1 = 0.5.

(ix) For Q4 ? Q5: Based on the correct to correct  relationship, we can get ( )15rev CC ?  = 1 ? 0.167 ? 1 = 0.167, ( )25rev CC ?  = 1 ? 0.286 ? 1 = 0.286, ( )45rev CC ?  = 1 ? 0.3 ? 1 = 0.3.

(x) For Q5 ? Q4: Based on the incorrect to incorrect  relationship, we can get ( )15rev CC ?  = 1 ? 0.167 ? 1 = 0.167, ( )25rev CC ?  = 1 ? 0.286 ? 1 = 0.286, ( )45rev CC ?  = 1 ? 0.3 ? 1 = 0.3.

[Step 4] Based on Eqs. (6) and (7), we can get: ? = 0.3 , rev(C2 ? C1) = 0.278,  and ? = 2 + 3 = 5, rev(C1 ? C2) = 0.286,  and ? = 3 + 2 = 5, rev(C3 ? C2) = 0.286,  and ? = 1 + 2 = 3, rev(C1 ?

C3) = 0.15,   and ? = 1 + 1 = 2, rev(C5 ? C1) = 0.278,  and ? = 1 + 3 = 4, rev(C5 ? C1) = 0.167,  and ? = 1 + 3 = 4, rev(C5 ? C2) = 0.286,  and ? = 1 + 2 = 3, rev(C5 ? C1) = 0.167,  and ? = 1 + 3 = 4, rev(C5 ? C2) = 0.286,  and ? = 1 + 2 = 3, [Step 5] Based on the concepts-relationship whose relevance degree are larger than ? (i.e., 0.3) or ? < 5 ? 50% (i.e., ? < 2.5), then we add an arrow form the concept Ci to the concept Cj associated with the relevance degree, as shown in Fig. 1.

[Step 6] Finally, we get the complete concepts-relationship map, as shown in Fig. 2.

First, we calculate the counter values, where the counter values indicate the answer-consistence between any two questions. Then, base on four kinds of association rules, we apply the Apriori Algorithm [1] to mine some information.

Finally, we calculate the relevance degree between any two concepts to construct concepts maps for adaptive learning systems. The proposed method provides us with a useful way to construct concepts map in adaptive learning systems.
