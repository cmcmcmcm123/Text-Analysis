Abstract-Mutually-inversistic fuzzy interval logic is the integration of mutually-inversistic fuzzy logic constructed by the author and interval arithmetic. It is used to deal with the fuzziness of interval values. It can be used to mine the fuzzy interval association rules embraced in the interval-values relational databases.

I. INTRODUCTION  An implicational proposition has a couple of mutually inverse processes: the process of establishing the implicational proposition and the process of employing it to make hypothetical inference after it is established. Classical logic[1] does not have the mutually inverse processes, so the author proposes mutually-inversistic logic[2]. Fuzzy logic[3] is an extension of classical logic, dealing with fuzziness. It also does not have the mutually inverse processes, so the author proposes mutually-inversistic fuzzy logic, also called mutually-inversistic logic with uncertainty[4]. The membership grade of an interval cannot be described by a single value, it can only be described by an membership grade interval. So, in this paper, the author combines mutually-inversistic fuzzy logic with interval arithmetic[5], proposing mutually- inversistic fuzzy interval logic.

Up to now, the fuzzy association rule mining of interval- valued relational databases[6, 7] is to regard the interval as a single value. The fuzzy support and fuzzy certainty of the fuzzy association rules mined are also single values. This does not reflect the real situation of the interval-valued relational databases. The fuzzy interval association rule mining based on mutually-inversistic fuzzy interval logic is to mine the intervals, the strength of support of the fuzzy interval association rules mined is a membership grade interval. This reflects the real situation of the interval-valued relational databases.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces mutually-inversistic fuzzy interval logic. Section 3 is fuzzy interval association rule mining from the interval- valued relational databases. Section 4 is prediction. Section 5 is the concluding remarks.



II. MUTUALLY-INVERSISTIC FUZZY INTERVAL  LOGIC Mutually-inversistic fuzzy interval logic can be formed  by combining mutually-inversistic fuzzy logic and interval arithmetic. The membership grade of an interval cannot be described by a single value, but by a membership grade interval. Suppose the membership grade interval of interval [xi-, xi+] is [?xi- , ?xi+ ], then we use [?x1- , ?x1+ ]/ [x1-, x1+]+?+[?xi- , ?xi+ ]/ [xi-, xi+]+?+[?xn- , ?xn+ ]/ [xn-, xn+] to represent the fuzzy interval ?A+. ??A+ [xi-, xi+]= [?xi- , ?xi+ ].

The adequate set of mutually-inversistic fuzzy interval logic is {?i (interval negation), ?i (interval conjunction), ?i-1  (interval mutually inverse implication)}. ?i [?x- , ?x+ ] is defined as [1- ?x+ , 1-?x- ]. [?x1- , ?x1+ ] ?i [?x2- , ?x2+ ] is defined as [(?x1-  +?x2- )/2, (?x1+ +?x2+ )/2].

For fuzzy interval mutually inverse implication  proposition ?A+ ?i-1 ?C+ ?there is a process of determining the membership grade interval of it, that is, the process of fuzzy interval association rule mining, and the process of hypothetical inference after it has been established as the major premise. The hypothetical inference consists of two steps. The first step is determining the membership grade interval of the minor premise ?A+ . The second step is the membership grade interval of the major premise times that of the minor premise to obtain that of the conclusion.

The fuzzy interval association rules are mined like this.

Suppose the universe is {[i1-, i1+], [i2-, i2+],?, [in-, in+]}. The membership grade interval of [ii-, ii+] to the antecedent ?A+ is [ai-, ai+], to the consequent ?C+ is [ci-, ci+]. The strength of support interval [ssi-, ssi+] of [ai-, ai+]?i-1 [ci-, ci+] is depicted by Algorithm 1.

Algorithm 1 (1) int-=c- - a+ ; (2) int+=c+-a-; (3) if(int- <=0<= int+ ) (4) then {ss+=1; (5)     if(int+ >=0.5) then temp1=0.5; (6)                else temp1=1- int+ ; (7)     temp2=1- int- ;     (8)     if(temp2 <= temp1 ) then ss-= temp2 ; (9)                     else ss-= temp1; (10)     } (11)  else if (int- >0) (12)      then {if(int- >=0.5) then ss- = ss- =0.5; (13)                      else if(int+ >=0.5) then { ss- =0.5; (14)                                          ss+=1- int- ; (15)                                         } (16)                                     else { ss+=1- int- ; (17)                                          ss- =1- int+ ; (18)                                         } (19)          } (20)  else if(int+ <0) (21)      then { ss+=1+ int+ ; (22)           ss- =1+ int- ; (23)          }   After [ss1-, ss1+],?, [ssn-, ssn+] have all been calculated,  we use [sst-, sst+]=([ss1-, ss1+]+?+ [ssn-, ssn+])/n to calculate the total strength of support interval [sst-, sst+], that is, the membership grade interval of the fuzzy interval mutually inverse implication proposition ?A+ ?i-1 ?C+ .



III. FUZZY INTERVAL ASSOCIATION RULE MINING Suppose we have an air quality interval-valued relational  database shown in Table 1.

Table 1 Air quality interval-valued relational database Universe Coal Consumption (CC) Traffic Density (TD) SO2 Density (SO2) [i1-, i1+] [0.58, 0.62] [2.5, 3.5] [0.015, 0.025] [i2-, i2+] [2, 2.5] [8.5, 9.5] [0.085, 0.095] [i3-, i3+] [0.2, 0.3] [18, 20] [0.011, 0.015] [i4-, i4+] [1.35, 1.45] [47.5, 48] [0.08, 0.095]   Suppose we want to mine the fuzzy interval association  rule ?if coal consumption (CC) is high and traffic density (TD) is heavy, then SO2 is dense?(-CC+ ?i -TD+ ?i-1 -SO2+ ).

High, heavy, and dense are fuzzy concepts, their membership functions are shown in Fig. 1 through Fig. 3.

Fig.1  The membership function for high  ?high  CC 0 2.5   TD  Fig.2  The membership function for heavy  ?heavy    SO2  Fig.3  The membership function for dense  ?dense   0.15     Each interval of attribute CC is converted to membership grade interval using Fig. 1, then we obtain fuzzy interval - CC+.

-CC+ =[0.232, 0.248]/ [i1-, i1+]+[0.8, 1]/ [i2-, i2+]+[0.08, 0.12]/ [i3-, i3+]+[0.54, 0.58]/ [i4-, i4+].

Likewise,  -TD+ =[0.05, 0.07]/ [i1-, i1+]+[0.17, 0.19]/ [i2-, i2+]+[0.36, 0.4]/ [i3-, i3+]+[0.95, 0.96]/ [i4-, i4+].

-SO2+ =[0.1, 0.167]/ [i1-, i1+]+[0.566, 0.633]/ [i2-, i2+]+[0.073, 0.1]/ [i3-, i3+]+[0.533, 0.633]/ [i4-, i4+].

Now, let?s calculate the strength of support interval of each interval to the association rule.

For [i1-, i1+], [a1-, a1+]=([0.232, 0.248]+[0.05, 0.07])/2=[(0.232+0.05)/2, (0.248+0.07)/2]=[0.141, 0.159].

[int1-, int1+]=[c1-, c1+]-[a1-, a1+]=[0.1, 0.167]-[0.141, 0.159]=[(0.1-0.159), (0.167-0.141)]=[-0.059, 0.026]. ss1+=1.

temp11=1-int1+=1-0.026=0.974. temp21=1+int1-=1+(- 0.059)=0.941. ss1-=temp21=0.941. [ss1- , ss1+ ]=[0.941, 1].

Likewise, [ss2- , ss2+ ]=[0.952, 1]. [ss3- , ss3+ ]=[0.823, 0.88]. [ss4- , ss4+ ]=[0.763, 0.888].

The total strength of support interval (the membership grade interval) of the fuzzy interval association rule (the major premise) -CC+ ?i -TD+ ?i-1 -SO2+ is [sst- , sst+ ]=( [ss1- , ss1+ ]+ [ss2- , ss2+ ]+ [ss3- , ss3+ ]+ [ss4- , ss4+ ])/4=([0.941, 1]+[0.952, 1]+[0.823, 0.88]+[0.763, 0.888])/4=[(0.941+0.952+0.823+0.763)/4, (1+1+0.88+0.888)/4]=[0.871, 0.942].



IV. PREDICTION  Suppose we have checked [i5-, i5+]: [CC5-, CC5+]=[0.135, 0.142], [TD5-, TD5+]=[10, 10.5]. And we want to predict the SO2 density.

First, let?s calculate the membership grade interval [a5-, a5+] of the minor premise -A5+. By Fig. 1, we can obtain  -CC5+: [0.054, 0.057]/ [i5-, i5+].

Likewise,  -TD5+: [0.2, 0.23]/ [i5-, i5+].

[a5-, a5+]=([0.054, 0.057]+[0.2, 0.23])/2=[(0.054+0.2)/2,  (0.057+0.23)/2]=[0.127, 0.144].

Then, by the membership grade interval of the major  premise [0.871, 0.942] times the membership grade interval of the minor premise [0.127, 0.144], we obtain the membership grade interval of the conclusion, that is, the membership grade interval of the SO2 density [?-SO25 , ?+SO25 ]=[0.871, 0.942]*[0.127, 0.144]=[(0.871*0.127), (0.942*0.144)]=[0.111, 0.135].

By Fig. 3, [SO-25, SO+25]= [?-SO25 , ?+SO25 ]*0.15=[(0.111*0.15), (0.135*0.15)]=[0.017, 0.02]. So, the predicted SO2 density interval is [0.017, 0.02].



V. CONCLUDING REMARKS  The membership grade of an interval cannot be described by a single value, but by a membership grade interval. So, this paper combines mutually-inversistic fuzzy logic with interval arithmetic to form mutually-inversistic fuzzy interval logic. Up to now, the fuzzy association rule mining of interval-valued relational databases is to regard the  interval as a single value. This does not reflect the real situation. The fuzzy interval association rule mining based on mutually-inversistic fuzzy interval logic is to mine the intervals.
