I. INTRODUCTION  With the increasing development of information technology and the continued large-scale of the data scale various professions, the data mining technology is unceasingly mature and develops gradually to the domain application direction. Data mining is a kind of technology which extracts the non-ordinary, implicit, unknown, potentially useful information from the large-scale data [1, 2]. As the continuous development of the cause of the sports information, the sports field has accumulated large amounts of data, so it will become a trend that data mining is applied to the data analysis in sports field, especially competitive and adversarial sports. Data mining's analysis methods are various, such as association rule mining and clustering analysis. In this paper, association rule mining as well as the improved Apriori algorithm are used to analyze the technology movements in football games. The correlation between movements therefore can be obtained, so that the rate of shoot goals for the players will be enhanced, which will provide a scientific basis for the training.



II. ASSOCIATION RULES AND ApRIORI ALGORITHM  Association rules, which reflect the mutual dependency and the relatedness between matters, are an important, highly active area of data mining. The extraction of association rules is to dig out the interesting association or correlation between the item sets in a large number of data. Apriori algorithm is the classical algorithm of the model in association rules, and it is the improved algorithm introduced by R. Agrawal et al [3] in 1994, which is based on AIS algorithm. Apriori algorithm uses a technology called "floor by floor search of the iterative method," of which the basic idea is to use recursive layer by layer approach. First, scan the database, resulting in frequent item sets; and then Apriori-gen makes use of the connection of the members of Lk-1 to produce candidates for frequent item sets Ck, especially after the members' being pruned. The supported numbers of each candidate frequent item sets    Lina Wang No.2 middle school of Handan city  Handan, China wanglinaenglish@126.com  thereby can be calculated by scanning the transaction database.

According to the comparison with the user-specified minimum supports, the item sets which are greater than the minimum supports are combined into K number of frequent item sets Lk ? The algorithm shall be carried on until no candidate frequent item sets are generated. As a result, all the frequent item sets are combined.

The biggest advantage of the Apriori algorithm is that algorithm's idea is relatively simple, which is based on recursive statistic, generating frequent item sets. Although it is easy to implement, the Apriori algorithm itself has a number of disadvantages, such as:  (1) Multiple scan of the transaction database will come into being. When a large number of transactional data are stored in the database, each scan time will be very long. In this way, their efficiency will be very low.

(2) A large number of candidate item sets will be produced. The k-1 candidate sets produced by Lk-1 are presenting exponential growth.



III. ASSOCIATION RULES ALGORITHM  A matrix representation of the database is given, the methods of which are following: item sets are arranged in sequence and transaction sets are also ranked in order. Item sets stand for row vector, while the panel stands for column vector. If the i item set is in the} affairs, then the value of the} row, and the i column in the matrix is 1, otherwise it is 0, which will be accordingly called Boolean matrix of the database. As is known from the analysis, anyone transaction needs scanning only one time, and then a Boolean matrix [4] corresponding to the database can be gotten.

For the inadequacies of Apriori algorithm, this paper adopts Association Rules of Boolean Matrix Algorithm (Association Rules Algorithm Based on Boolean Matrix, abbrev. ARABBM), and gives the basic design ideas and description of the algorithm. Compared with the classical algorithm, the algorithm only scans the database once to accelerate the speed of scanning the frequent item sets.

Boolean matrix is a good data representation; ARABBM algorithm transmits the transaction database into a Boolean matrix form and then stores in bits and finally saves a lot of memory space; frequent item sets instead of candidate item sets are directly generated by Boolean algorithm. Therefore, on one hand ,bottlenecks problems of iteratively producing  PElTS 2009    frequent item sets shall be effectively solved improve the efficiency of frequent item sets found; on the other hand, the efficiency of frequent item sets' being found shall be improved.

A. The relevant definition and theorem  Definition 1 I={I j,I2, ... .L} is a collection of items, D={Dj,DJ, ... ,Dm} is a collection of services. Given minimum support min_sup, then the minimum support several min_supth = min_sup x m. The entire database can be represented by Boolean matrix, namely:  A mn= a2j a22??? a2n

IV. ASSOCIATION MINING OF THE COMMON TECHNIQUES IN FOOTBALL MATCH  Here is an example to illustrate how to use the algorithm to dig out the most common technical movements among football match association process with ARABBM. Five common goal-data connected with football match technical movements (similar to mass data mining process) is shown in Table 1, namely I = {L, 12, 13, L, I5} , I, is on behalf of the technical action steal, 12 -shots district 2, 13 -the dribble breakthrough,

I.j~midfield attack, 15 -Positioning the ball. D = {D), D2, D3, D.j, D5} , if the minimum support min_sup = 30%, minimum confidence level ofmin_conf= 40%, transaction number m = 5, then the minimum supports several min_supth = 2.

Table 1 football match technical movement transaction data  Scan Boolean matrix A'5.j, as in  A j A2 A3 A5 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 (2) 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0  Seek the matrix of all 2-item sets vector inner product to obtain the corresponding supports:  {II,I2}.supth=1 xO+Ox 1+1 x 1+0 x 1+1 x 1=2  Similarly, {L, I3}.Supth = 2, {L, I5}.Supth = 1, {I2, I3} .

Supth = 3, {I2, I5}.Supth = 3, {I3, I5} . Supth = 2. Because of {Ij, I5}.Supth <2, {I], I5} belongs to non-frequent item sets.

(1)  TID Technical movements  1 1],14  2 12,13,1 5  3 11,12,1 3,1 5  4 12,15  5 1],12,1 3  (1) D transformed into a Boolean matrix A55, as in  A j A2 A3 A.j A5 1 0 0 1 0 o 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 o 1 001 1 1 100  (2) Scan Boolean matrices A55, seeking frequent 1- item sets. The supports can be obtained by vector in each project (element values in each column of the boolean matrix): Ij.supth = 3, I2.supth = 4, Ij.supth = 3, I.j.supth = 1, Ij.supth = 3.

Because I.j.supth <min_supth = 2, {I.j} belongs to non- frequent item sets. The corresponding vector A.j is to be removed of the project L in the Boolean matrix A55? Therefore frequent 1 - item sets collection can be obtained: L1 = {{I j}, {I2} , {I3} , {I5} } .

ml a m2' .. a mn  Where each column represents the project, aij(l~i~m, 1 0~n) is satisfied: if the item Ij(j~n) in the transaction Di(i ~m) appears, note the aij=l, otherwise aij=O. The definition of item Ij vector [5] for the Aj={ajj,a2j;?? ,amj} , then the item Ij support recorded as ~.supth=ajj+a2j+???+amj .

Definition 2 K item sets {L, Ij ; ? ? , Ik } of the vector inner product is expressed as Aij???k=Ai/\Aj/\ ... /\Ak=( ali/\alj/\ ...

/\ ajk' a? /\ a2j /\ ... /\ a?- ... , ami /\ amj /\ ... /\ amk), Where " /\" presents logic and computing. K item sets {L, Ij ; ? ? , Ik} 's supports are recorded as {L, Ij; ? ? , Ik}.supth = ali/\alj/\ .?. /\ a., + a? /\ a2j /\ ... /\ a? + ... + ami /\ amj /\ ... /\ amk. If the supports of the numbers in K item sets are not less than the minimum support counts , then the set is called frequent item sets.

Theorem 1 A non-frequent item sets must be either a superset of the non-frequent item sets.

Theorem 2 If in the K item set X={ 11, 12, ??? , Ik }there exists j E X so that ILk-1G)I<k-1, then X is not a frequent item sets. Wherell.j., G)lrepresents frequent (k-1) a collection of the numbers ofj contained in the item sets Lk- 1?  Proof: Suppose X is a K-dimensional frequent item sets, then it's K a K-1 dimensional subset are in Lk-1? In K-1 dimensional subset generated by x, each item j E X there were, K-1 times, j EX, arelLk_ 1G)I>k-1, with contradiction conditions, therefore, X is not a frequent item sets.

Theorem 3 [6] For a collection of frequent K item sets Lk, if ILkl<k+1, the number of frequent item sets in the largest mining transaction database is k. Where, ILkl refers to the numbers of frequent item sets K in the Lk.

According to Theorem 1 to Theorem 3, the candidate item sets can be effectively cut, and the redundant item sets can also be eliminated. It is more efficient than Apriori algorithm to frequent item sets.

So frequent 2- item sets set is described as follows:  L2={ {II,I2},{lj,13},{12,13},{12,lj},{13,lj}} 0  (3) According to Theorem 2, the appearing numbers of every item in L2 are calculated as follows, IL2(l j)1=2, IL2(12)1 =3, IL2(13)1=3, IL2(lj)I=2. Since the appearing numbers of these items are not less than 2, corresponding vectors need not to be deleted in the Boolean matrix A'j4.

(4) Seek all 3- item sets vector inner product in the Boolean matrix A'j4 to obtain the corresponding supports:  {l j,12,13} .supth=2, {lj,12,lj} .supth- l, {l j,13,lj}.supth=l,{12,I3,lj}.

supth=2. Owing to the supports is less than the minimum support in the project set {II, 12, Ij} " {II,I3,lj}, so they have non-frequent item sets. The collection of Frequent item sets 3-: L3={ {lj,12,13},{12,I3,lj}}.

According to Theorem 3, because IL31<4, when algorithm is over, all the frequent item sets are as follows:  L={ {Ij},{12},{13},{Ij}, {lj,12},{l j,13},{12,13},{12,lj}, {13,lj}, {l j,12,13}, {12,13,lj}}.

Take the formed association rules frequent 3- item sets {L, 12, 13} for example, the relationship among the technical movements represented by {II, 12,13} shall be illustrated.

Ij--'1213, 12--'Ij13, 13--'Ijl2 ' Ijl2--'13 ' Ijl3--'12 ' 1213--' I, confidence degrees are as follows:  Confidence (Ij--' 1213) =2/3=70%  Confidence (12--'Ij13) =2/4=50%  Confidence (13--'Ij12) =2/3=70%  Confidence (l jl2--'13) =1=100%  Confidence (l jl3--'12) =1=100%  Confidence (1213--'L) =1=100%  They all meet the minimum level of confidence: min_conf = 0.4 = 40%.From the above ,we can know that during the excavation process the transaction data table the most commonly used technical moves are Ij (steals), 12 (2 area shot), 13 (the dribble breakthrough) and their combinations, and they are to meet the threshold min_sup and min_conf. Of these combinations, Ij--'1213 indicates that the football player "steal" the other side ball which is followed by at least 30% of support and 70% of confidence, then the player will use "the dribble breakthrough" technical action to shot from the Stadium 2 area, which easily lead them to kick the ball into the other goal.

Use the same methods to deal with all the possible formed association rules, which will provide guidance for the players to focus on the technical movement exercises, thereby enhancing the rate of shoot goals.

v. CONCLUSIONS This article describes the data mining of association rules  mining, and discusses the application of the improved mining algorithm in the most commonly used movements of kicking   goals in football match. Moreover, common association relations of the technical movements will be extracted, which provides a decision for coaches to train and guide the football players. It makes it an important tool to enhance the level of competition by applying data mining technology in football match.
