An Approach to Privacy-Preserving Alert Correlation and Analysis

Abstract?Privacy issues are concerned when data holders share their detected security data for correlation and analysis purpose.

This paper proposes an approach to correlate and analyze intrusion alerts, while preserve privacy for alert holders. The raw intrusion alerts are protected by improved k-anonymity model, which preserves the alert regulation inside disturbed data records. With this privacy preserving technique, combing the typical FP-tree association rules mining algorithm, the approach provides the capacity of well balancing the alert correlation and the privacy preservation. Experimental results show that this approach works comparatively efficient and reaches a well balance between the alerts correlation and the privacy issues.

I. INTRODUCTION Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are widely deployed to  defend against large-scale attacks and security threats. Existing IDSs, however, often trigger too many alerts daily[1-3].

Moreover, the false alerts are mixed up with the true ones[1, 4], making it more difficult to identify the real hidden attacks.

Alert correlation and analysis methods[1, 3] have been investigated to get an in-depth insight into the threats and to build a higher level attack scenario across networks.

Meanwhile various communities such as organizations, institutions and users are unwilling to share their data for security analysis without privacy guarantees. Data holders have concerns that sharing detailed information will be at the risk of their own security, such as information around intranet topology structure, certain services, and the security infrastructure deployment. Therefore, privacy-preserving techniques are required in the process of IDS alerts correlation and analysis.

Existing privacy-preserving approaches[5-7] usually perform transformation on original data to protect sensitive data before sharing and correlating. Lincoln et al.[5] apply standard and keyed hash functions to ensure privacy for the sensitive attributes such as IP addresses. The approach is feasible even in large alert loads, while it still has limitations in alerts correlation when using different keys in keyed hashing.

Xu and Ning [6] use a conceptual hierarchy based approach to generalize original attributes to high-level concepts. The approach, however, is not easy to control the generalization process in complex circumstance. Xu and Ning[7] also propose three methods to anonymize sensitive attributes of alerts and build attack scenarios. Their schemes include artificial alerts injection into original data sets, attribute randomization and  data set partitioning and randomization. But the correlation results will be highly influenced by the selection of parameters.

Therefore, a privacy-preserving correlation and analysis approach is proposed in this paper to discover efficient association rules among protected alert?s attributes. Within affordable calculation cost, it has been proved to be efficient to perform alert correlation and preserve sensitive attributes. The generated association rules can be used in operational IDSs to retrench intrusion events and react against attacks found.

Section 2 designs the framework for alert correlation and analysis with privacy-preserving capability. Section 3 proposes a privacy-preserving based alert correlation and analysis method. Section 4 shows experiments and performance comparison with classical alert correlation algorithm.

Conclusions and further work are shown in Section 5.



II. ALERT CORRELATION AND ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK WITH PRIVACY-PRESERVING CAPABILITY  Intrusion alert correlation and analysis closely rely on the collections of security data sets, which become sensitive when certain security or individual information is involved. For instance, IP addresses and port numbers in IDS alerts might show intranet topology and running services, which are considered sensitive for certain critical networks. These would also be the foundations for hackers to compromise the whole network step by step. In this section, a privacy-preserving alert correlation and analysis framework is designed to obtain association rules among protected alert?s attributes for the purpose of alerts correlation.

The privacy-preserving alert correlation and analysis framework, which is shown in Fig. 1, is designed on the basis of the classical Common Intrusion Detection Framework (CIDF)[8]. The external rectangle region represents the network domain relatively independent to other ones. Detected intrusion alerts within this domain will be protected before being shared for security correlation and analysis. Taking the different level of sensitivity of the variant attributes in the mining process of the alert correlation into account, k- anonymity method[9, 10], a classical privacy-preserving method, is improved to preserve the alert?s semantic as much as possible during the process of attributes anonymization.

With this improved privacy preserving method, combing the typical FP-tree association rules mining approach, the framework is set up.

Data and control flows among the components in the framework are denoted by the solid lines in Fig. 1. While the  This research is funded by NFSC of China under grant number of 60702047.

2010 IEEE Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference  DOI 10.1109/APSCC.2010.85     dashed line means the message shared for alerts correlation between network domains.

The whole framework is mainly composed of five components. The main components and their functions are given as follows:  ? Data collector: to collect raw packets coming from the network and to provide them to analyzer for analysis.

Data collectors will be deployed in the nodes of high network flow, and amount of which depends on domain?s security policy.

? Data analyzer: to analyze collected data by means of pattern matching or other analysis methods to find intrusion events.

? Intrusion events database: to store intrusion events and relevant datasets during the process of intrusion detection and analysis.

? Monitor: to supervise running status of other components and to give reports to security administrator about security status.

? Privacy-preserving alert correlation and analysis agent: to use a privacy preservation technique to protect the detected alert attributes before they are shared with the utility which are not jeopardized. Afterwards, to perform alerts correlation and analysis algorithm to discover association rules or sequence patterns for explaining the global behavior of each attack, the result of which will be stored in intrusion events database and displayed on monitor component.

The work of this paper is to mainly focus on the marked area in Fig. 1. Experimental results have proved that this framework is valuable on globally analyzing and explaining the data that IDS received with the consideration of sensitive attributes.



III. PRIVACY-PRESERVING BASED ALERT CORRELATION AND ANALYSIS APPROACH  The goal of this section is to provide the privacy-preserving method for intrusion alerts, with the correlation and analysis process on the protected alert attributes, which can be described in the following two steps  A. Step1:Protect sensitive alert attributes by the improved k- anonymity method Privacy-preserving techniques, such as data perturbation  and data modification, are widely developed and used in the area of data mining and knowledge discovery in databases[11, 12]. Considering the characteristics of intrusion alerts correlation, k-anonymity method, a classical privacy- preserving method, is improved to preserve the alert regulation inside disturbed data records. Classical k-anonymity model uses the term quasi-identifier to help judging whether k- anonymity properties are met. In the situation of protecting sensitive attributes in intrusion alerts, the sensitive fields are what we exactly care about for the purpose of protecting privacy, regardless of the quasi-identifier.

Before going into the details of the method proposed, some notions and definitions are clarified first.

Definition 1 Attributes  Let AL(A1,?,An) be an alerts set with a finite number of security alerts. The finite set of attributes of AL are { A1,?,An }.

Definition 2 k-anonymity  Let AL(A1,?,An) be an alerts set and SD(Ai,?,Aj) be a set of sensitive attributes to be protected, and { Ai,?Aj } ? { A1,?An }. AL satisfies k-anonymity if and only if each sequence of values in SD appears with at least k occurrences in AL[SD].

Let OA(A1,?,An) be an original alerts set, the k-anonymity method is used for the selective modification of sensitive attributes in SD, with all the other attributes remain unchanged.

The discrete values of sensitive alert attributes in OA are replaced by their generalization values which are predefined according to domain?s security policy. Uncertainty is introduced into alerts set but with semantics for preserving alerts regulation.

B. Step2:Alert correlation and analysis method Frequent pattern mining technique[13] is highly suitable for  alert analysis with the ability of deriving frequent itemsets and association rules. Especially, algorithm FP-Tree is good at efficient mining of frequent patterns in large database, which applying a compressed, frequent pattern tree FP-Tree structure for mining frequent patterns without candidate generation. The FP-Tree algorithm mainly includes the following two algorithms: FP-Tree construction and FP-Growth [14].

Emphasis will be put on method of mining association rules among protected alert?s attributes for retrenching and filtering intrusion events.

Figure 1. Alert Correlation Framework with Privacy-preserving Capability     The pseudo-code for privacy-preserving based alert correlation and analysis algorithm is given in Fig. 2. Some notations used in the algorithm are described as follows:  ? VGH( )is a value generalization function for sensitive attributes.

? AL(A1,?,ANg) is the protected intrusion alerts set of OA.

? All intrusion alerts share the same attribute vector{date, starttime, endtime, protocol, source IP address, destination IP address, source port number, destination port number, attackname}

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS In this section, we demonstrate a comparison of the  approach this paper proposed with the classical association rules mining algorithm FP-tree without privacy-preserving capability. An intranet environment is constructed for the experiments which deploys 4 application servers (Database  Figure2. Privacy-preserving Based Alert Correlation and Analysis Algorithm  server, WEB server, FTP server and DNS server) inside and SNORT[15] as a bypass unit at the entrance of our intranet. To validate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach, intrusion alerts are collected from SNORT deployed in the intranet. Table 1 summarizes the numbers and types of the alerts.

4.1 Effectiveness A set of experiments is designed to evaluate the privacy of  the attributes to be protected and the effectiveness of the alert association rules to discover, before and after the privacy preserving method is applied.

Table 2A shows some of the intrusion alerts generated by the SNORT in the intranet. The example of association rule among these original alert attributes finally discovered is given in Table 2B.

In the experiment, d_IP (destination IP address) and d_port (destination port number) are the sensitive attributes.

Transformations are made to these attributes by the improved k-anonymity method, which are generalized to their more general values with most semantics. Therefore, sensitive attributes in original alerts are protected as Table 3A shows.

We can get the association rule that describes the same security information as classical FP-tree algorithm discovers, which is shown in Table 3B.

The association rules discovery result comparison between our approach and classical FP-tree algorithm is illustrated in Table 4, which indicates high retrench ration on intrusion alerts of our approach.

4.2 Scalability The runtime of our approach and classical FP-tree  algorithm on 1000 experimental alerts with k=2 as the min-sup changes is shown in Fig. 3.

In the experiment, classical FP-tree algorithm is only around 10% faster than our approach on discovering association rules among those alert attributes in average, which is easy to understand because our approach protects sensitive attributes in original alerts. As the min-sup is high, the set of frequent itemsets is not comparatively large, so the gap becomes even smaller. However, when the min-sup is small enough, our approach?s time cost is at the advantage because of the short list of frequent items in its generalization, which makes sensitive attributes actually different appear equal.

Fig. 4 shows the scalability of the two methods based on different number of intrusion alerts. It illustrates the linear increase of runtime verses the number of alerts. Our approach gets the better runtime performance out of the same reason with small min-sup.

Privacy guarantees will accelerate the research developments in the according area, and make it more feasible.

This paper proposes the privacy-preserving approach to correlate and analyze the intrusion alerts without the risk of sensitive information disclosure during the process. The approach is proved to be effective in utility with a favorite retrench ratio of alerts and affordable performance over massive intrusion alerts. An open question is that which causes a greater impact on the effectiveness of alert correlation: the number of attributes that is being anonymized or the privacy- preserving algorithm that is being applied. In addition, the association rules with low support and low confidence are also useful for intrusion analysis. Therefore, personality mining is a future research direction worth researching.
