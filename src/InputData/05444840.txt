Abstract  This paper presents a novel approach to overcome the difficulty and complexity in detecting and predicting e-banking phishing website. We proposed an intelligent resilient and effective model that is based on using association and classification Data Mining algorithms. These algorithms were used to characterize and identify all the factors and rules in order to classify the phishing website and the relationship that correlate them with each other. We implemented six different classification algorithm and techniques to extract the phishing training data sets criteria to classify their legitimacy. We also compared their performances, accuracy, number of rules generated and speed. The rules generated from the associative classification model showed the relationship between some important characteristics like URL and Domain Identity, and Security and Encryption criteria in the final phishing detection rate.

The experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of using Associative Classification techniques in real applications and its better performance as compared to other traditional classifications algorithms.

1. Introduction  Phishing websites is the process of enticing people to visit fraudulent ebanking websites and persuading them to enter identity information such as usemames and passwords. The information is then used to impersonate victims in order to empty their bank accounts, run fraudulent auctions, launder money, and so on. The word phishing from the phrase "website phishing" is a variation on the word "fishing". The idea is that bait is thrown out with the hopes that a user will grab it and bite into it just like the fish. The motivation behind this study is to create a resilient and   effective method that uses Data Mining algorithms and tools to detect e-banking phishing websites in an Artificial Intelligent technique. Associative and classification algorithms can be very useful in predicting Phishing websites. It can give us answers about what are the most important e-banking phishing website characteristics and indicators and how they relate with each other. Comparing between different Data Mining Classification and Association methods and techniques is also a goal of this investigation. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the literature review, Section 3 shows data mining phishing approach, Section 4 shows the theory and methodology of the research, Section 5 shows the utilization of the DM classification techniques, Section 6 reveals the experimental results and then conclusions and future work are given in Section 7.

2. Literature Review  A report by Gartner estimated the costs at $1,244 per victim, an increase over the $257 they cited in a 2004 report [1]. In 2007, Moore and Clayton estimated the number of phishing victims by examining web server logs. They estimated that 311,449 people fall for phishing scams annually, costing around 350 million dollars [2]. There are several promising defending approaches to this problem reported earlier. One approach is to stop phishing at the email level [3], since most current phishing attacks use broadcast email (spam) to lure victims to a phishing website.

Another approach is to use security toolbars. The phishing filter in IE7 [4] is a toolbar approach with more features such as blocking the user's activity with a detected phishing site. A third approach is to visually differentiate the phishing sites from the spoofed legitimate sites. Dynamic Security Skins [5] proposes to use a randomly generated visual hash to customize    the browser window or web form elements to indicate the successfully authenticated sites. A fourth approach is two-factor authentication , which ensures that the user not only knows a secret but also presents a security token [6]. Many industrial antiphishing products use toolbars in Web browsers, but some researchers have shown that security tool bars don't effectively prevent phishing attacks. Another approach is to employ certification, e.g., Microsoft spam privacy [7]. A variant of web credential is to use a database or list published by a trusted party, where known phishing web sites are blacklisted. The weaknesses of this approach are its poor scalability and its timeliness.

The newest version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer supports Extended Validation (EV) certificates, coloring the URL bar green and displaying the name of the company. However, a recent study found that EV certificates did not make users less fall for phishing attacks [8].

3. Phishing Data Mining Approach  3.1. Phishing Characteristics and Indicators  There are many characteristics and indicators that can distinguish the original legitimate ebanking website from the phishing one. We managed to gather 27 phishing features and indicators and clustered them into six Criteria (URL & Domain Identity, Security & Encryption, Source Code & Java script, Page Style & Contents, Web Address Bar and Social Human Factor), and each criteria has its own phishing components. The full list is shown in table I which is used later on our analysis and methodology study.

3.2 Why use Data Mining?

OM is the process of searching through large amounts of data and picking out relevant information.

It has been described as "the nontrivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from large data sets [9]. Data mining tools predict future trends and behaviors , allowing businesses to make proactive, knowledge-driven decisions [10].

4. Theory and Methodology  4.1. Data Mining Techniques The approach described here is to apply data mining  algorithms to assess e-banking phishing website risk on the 27 characteristics and factors which stamp the forged website. We utilized data mining classification and association rule approaches in our new e-banking phishing website detection model as shown in figure I   to find significant patterns of phishing characteristic or factors in the e-banking phishing website archive data.

Particularly, we used a number of different existing data mining association and classification techniques including JRip, PART [II], PRISM [12] and C4.5 [13], CBA [14], MCAR [15] algorithms to learn and to compare the relationships of the different phishing classification features and rules. The experiments of C4.5, RIPPER, PART and PRISM algorithms were conducted using the WEKA software [16]. CBA and MCAR experiments were conducted using an implementation provided by the authors of [14], [15].

AC Model for Detecting Phishing We used two web access archives, one from APWG archive [17] and one from Phishtank archive [18]. We managed to extract the whole 27 phishing security features and clustered them to its 6 corresponding criteria as mentioned before in table 1.

4.2. Website Phishing Training Data Sets  Two publicly available datasets were used to test our implementation: the "phishtank" from the phishtank.com [18] which is considered one of the primary phishing-report collates both the 2007 and 2008 collections. The PhishTank database records the URL for the suspected website that has been reported, the time of that report, and sometimes further detail such as the screenshots of the website, and is publicly available. The Anti Phishing Working Group (APWG) which maintains a "Phishing Archive" describing phishing attacks dating back to September 2007 [3]. A data set of 1006 phishing, suspicious and legitimate ebanking websites is used in the study (412 row phishing ebanking websites, 288 rows suspicious and 306 row of real ebanking websites for the legitimate portion of the data set). In addition, 27 features are used to train and test the classifiers. We used a series of short scripts to programmatically extract the above features, and store these in an excel sheet for quick reference.

5. DM Classification Techniques  5.1. Associative Classification Algorithms The practical part of this comparative study utilizes  six different common OM classification algorithms (C4.5, JRip, PART, PRISM, CBA and MCAR). Our choice of these methods is based on the different strategies they used in learning rules from data sets.

The C4.5 algorithm [13] employs divide and conquer approach, and the RIPPER algorithm uses separate and conquer approach. The choice of PART algorithm is based on the fact that it combines both approaches to generate a set of rules. PRISM is a classification rule which can only deal with nominal attributes and doesn't do any pruning. CBA algorithm employs association rule mining [14] to learn the classifier and then adds a pruning and prediction steps. Finally, MCAR algorithm consists of two phases: rules generation and a classifier builder. In the first phase, MCAR scans the training data set to discover frequent single items, and then recursively combines the items generated to produce items involving more attributes.

MCAR then generates ranks and stores the rules. In the second phase, the rules are used to generate a classifier by considering their effectiveness on the training data set [IS].

5.2. MCAR Phishing Model Approach  Associative Classification is a special case of association rule mining in which only the class attribute is considered in the rule's right-hand-side   (consequent), for example A, B -) Y, Then A, B must be input items attributes and Y must be the output class attribute. The attribute values for all our input items which represent the six ebanking phishing features and criteria ranged between three fuzzy set values (Genuine, Doubtful and Legitimate) which we measured before in our previous paper using Fuzzy Logic [19] taking into consideration all the input fuzzy variables for all criteria different components as shown in Table I. The output class attribute of our e- banking phishing website rate is one of these values (Very Legitimate, Legitimate, Suspicious, Phishy or Very Phishy). Example of the training phishing data sets to be classified is shown in Table 2.

Table 2. Example of Training Phishing Data Sets  :: .c '"... '"... .;: <: ... <: J  IX .. ;;, ... ' OJ::I <: "0 Class/ Phishing ~ '" .... en "0 0... enen < Rate  1 G G D G G G Very Leaitimate  2 D G G D G D Legitimate  3 D D G F D G Suspicious  4 F D G D F D Phishy  5 D F F D F r Very Phishy  * (f =(fenlline f)= Doubtful F= Fraud  To derive a set of class association rules from the training data set, it must satisfy certain user-constraints, i.e support and confidence thresholds. Generally, in association rule mining, any item that passes MinSupp is known as a frequent item.

We recorded the prediction accuracy and the number of rules generated by the classification algorithms and the new associative classification approaches we used in Table 3 and Table 4 respectively. Error rate comparative chart is shown in figure 2.

Also we found insignificant trivial in~uence of the (Page Style & Content) criteria along with (Social Human Factor) criteria for identifying e- banking phishing websites. The number of rules extracted from the PRISM algorithms is the highest since it doesn't do any pruning process. Associative classifiers produce more accurate classification models and rules than traditional classification algorithms.

The experiments also demonstrate the feasibility of using Associative Classification techniques in real appli~ations involving large databases. Finally, the expenment results showed that the proposed associative classification MCAR algorithm outperformed all other traditional classifications in terms of accuracy and speed (Err. Rate: 12.622 %) since it requires only one phase to discover frequent items and rules.

Conclusion and Future Work  The associative classification data mmmg e- banking phishing website model showed the significance importance of the phishing website two criteria's (URL & Domain Identity) and (Security & Encryption) with insignificant trivial influence of some other criteria like 'Page Style & content' and ' So.cial Human Factor ' in the final phishing rate, which can help us in building website phishing detection system. The experiments indicate that associative classification algorithm MCAR is highly competitive when compared with other traditional classifications in term of prediction accuracy and efficiency. As for future work, we want to use different pruning methods like lazy pruning [15] which discards rules that incorrectly classify training  Error Rate for all Classifiers  Figure 2.
