Server Virtualization by User Behaviour Model using a Data Mining  Technique ? A Preliminary Study

Abstract  Server virtualization is the masking of server resources, including the number and identity of individual physical servers, processors, and operating systems, from server users. However, the problem of tuning dynamic resource allocation is a novelty. Managing heterogeneous workloads running within virtual machines is an interesting and challenging topic of server virtualization. This research applied association rule discovery, which is one of the data mining techniques to predict level of user access. The results illustrate that performance of the predictive model for a proxy server is 86.86%.  The performance of the predictive model for a web server is 87.18%. Additionally, user behaviors for proxy and web servers are visualized.

The results suggest that user behaviors are different in term of workload, day and time usage.  This preliminary study may be an approach to improve management of data centers running heterogeneous workloads using server virtualization.

1. Introduction   Nowadays, the trend towards green computing is increasing. Green computing is defined as ?the study and practice of using computing resources efficiently?. Server virtualization on user behavior is one of the approaches toward solutions.

Virtualization of server resources is a method of running multiple independent virtual operating systems on a single physical computer.  It is a way of maximizing physical resources to maximize the investment in hardware and also a way of achieving higher server density. The concept of server virtualization can reduce the number of physical machine servers.

When the number of servers is reduced, it reduces energy costs. The personnel cost will also be decreased. It is an easy-care system.

In this paper, we propose to use association rules for predicting user behavior of heterogeneous workloads. In addition, user behaviors on proxy servers and web servers are visually compared.

The paper is structured as follows: related works Section 2.  Server virtualization with mining model Section 3.  Framework of the study is presented Section 4.  Experimental results demonstrated in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 describes conclusions and future work.

3. Server Virtualization with Mining Model   The traditionally heterogeneous workload management for server virtualization does not consider using in user behaviour. However, we believe that there are different both times and type of services in user behaviors.

Figure 1. Shows the framework of system  The Figure 1 shows the server virtualization system using data mining to predict user behaviors in management of heterogeneous workload.  This paper proposes primary studying user behaviors in several types of services and also studying behaviors for each period of times. We introduce new concept to improve management heterogeneous workload system, using data mining technique to predict user behaviors.

4. Framework   The study consists of 3 main steps. The Figure 2 shows the framework of our system. The first step is data storage and preparation. After collected server log file and process of cleaning data have done, the number of user accesses is counted and defined level of the access. The second is creating a system model.

Finally, the last step is testing the model to verify the performance of the system.

4.1 Data Storage and Preparation  Data from proxy servers and web servers are collected. The Figure 3 shows the example of proxy server data.  The Figure 4 shows the example of web server data.  Typically, these access log files contain millions of records. Each record refers to a visit by a user to a certain web page served by the web and proxy servers. The data set contains one month and 13 days. The log was collected from 00:00:00 November 1, 2008 through 23:59:59 December 13, 2008.

Figure 2. Shows the framework of system          Figure 3. Example log file from proxy server          Figure 4. Example log file from web server  The number of user accesses in proxy servers and web servers are counted. After that, the frequencies of both the day of the week and the time are calculated. Then, levels of access are categorized into 5 levels: ?1? for low level; ?2? for medium low level; ?3? for medium level; ?4? for medium high level; and ?5? for high level. Here, the levels of access are assumed to be uniformly distributed.

The extracted rules for LHS are based on days of week and 1-hour period time.

Let D1, D2, ?, D7 be days and T1,T2, ?,T24 be time. However, we restrict the RHS as follows. Let L1, L2, L3, L4, L5 be the levels of user access for the RHS that can be predicted based on the term on the LHS. Therefore, a rule kji LTD , is created.

Where kL occurs most frequently in the rows.

For each rule of the form RHSLHS , we define  the supp and conf as the support and confidence as follows.

Confidence and support value are used for rule selections. Because plenty of rules are generated, some simple concerns in rule selections include:    1) Select the rule with maximum confidence.

2) Select the rule with maximum support if confidence value is equal.

3) Select the rule that happens first when confidence and support values are equal.

Table 2. Prediction model of proxy server with confidence and support values.

From Table 1, some prediction rules include: level  of user access from the proxy server on Monday at 10:00 AM is ?Low?. Level of user access on Tuesday at 10:00 AM is ?Medium?.

Table 2 shows total association prediction model for proxy server with confidence and support values.

4.3 Test model   The performance of the model was tested. In general, the data is divided into a training data set and a test data set.

Data obtained in November for 30 days are used to train the model while data acquired for 13 days in December are used to test the performance of the model. Note that the ratio of the training set and testing set is 70:30.

An example of Table 3: model prediction using association rules on Monday 12.00 AM ? 08:00 AM, the level of user access for proxy server is ?Low?. The rule is verified by the test model using the same day and time. The level of the user access is ?Low?, which is corresponding to our generated association rule.  Therefore, the accuracy is marked as ?T? (Testing model is accurate).

The rule is validated by the test model using the same day and time.

Level of user access is ?Medium High?, which does not correspond to our rules.  Therefore, the accuracy is marked as ?F? (Test model is inaccurate).

5. Results and Discussion   The performance of the predictive model for the proxy server is 86.86%.

Similarly, the performance of the predictive model for the web server is measured the same way as the proxy server. The results demonstrate that the accuracy prediction of the level of user access for the web server is 87.18%.

User behaviors corresponding to the workload and time are displayed as in Figure 5 and Figure 6.

Figure 5 shows user access behavior for the proxy server. It can be seen that during 07.00 to 16.00, user accesses are more frequent than other times for each day of the week. Nevertheless, the accesses are lower on Saturday and Sunday than other days of the week.

Tuesday seems to have the highest access during 07.00-16.00  Figure 6 illustrates the user access behavior for the web server. It can be interpreted that during 08:00 to 16:00, there are less frequent accesses than others time. More accesses appear after 16.00. According the graph in Figure 6, the access is peak on Monday at 19.00.

In general, behavior of user access for web server is opposite to the proxy server. For example, high access in proxy server but low access in web server.

This implies that the workload of user behaviors is different according to the time and type of servers.

Understanding in user behavior could be used for workload management process.

This technique can improve the performance of server virtualization and may reduce the number of machines running. For example, when the proxy server utilization is high, the web server utilization is low as in Figure 5 and Figure 6. It is possible to aggregate two types of these services to work together in the same machine. However, factors such as CPU load, memory, and other factors should also be considered.

Figure 5. Average user access to proxy server over a 24 hour period                       6. Conclusions and Future work  This research applied association rules, one of the data mining techniques to predict level of user access for proxy and web server. The performances of the predicting model for proxy and web server are 86.86% and 87.18%, respectively. Moreover, the visualization approach for the proxy and web server demonstrates that user behaviors are different by times and type of services. Understanding user behaviors may improve the efficiency of heterogeneous workload management.

More work remains to be done. In the immediate future, we plan to investigate user behaviors focusing on data size for each period time. We also plan to study CPU and memory loads.
