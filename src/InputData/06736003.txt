Effects of Imperfect CSIT on Downlink MU-MIMO Fair SLNR Scheduling Algorithm

Abstract?Indoor downlink communication contributes to a large part of the data traffic generated in today?s world. The demand for high rate wireless indoor coverage while providing complete support to the existing wireless technologies is a big challenge. The future proof centralized optical fiber indoor back haul for efficient indoor coverage is gaining a lot of attention recently. Physical layer techniques like multiuser MIMO (MU- MIMO) is becoming an inevitable approach in this regard.

Quality of service serves as the most attractive feature that should be ensured among the mobile terminals (MTs). In this work we try to study the effects of imperfections in channel knowledge owing to estimation errors. We study the effects of it on our previously proposed throughput fair successive signal to leakage and noise ratio (SLNR) precoding algorithm [1] for such a fiber-wireless (Fi-Wi) MU-MIMO indoor. Our algorithm has been shown previously to achieve maximal fairness. In this paper we use MMSE alterations to significantly reduce the effect of estimation errors for our scheme. We provide a lower bound on the sum rate achievable with imperfect CSIT. In this paper we also compare different power allocation policies. Power allocation policies plays an important part in improving the performance of the system in terms of BER of the worst case user. We show that channel adaptive power allocation guarantees approximately 3dB SNR improvement over the equal power allocation policy for BER of 10?7.

I. INTRODUCTION  Indoor downlink is a large contributor to the data traffic transferred in todays world. Rapid growth in smartphone industry and cheap end devices that demands for high data rates, the growth of downlink traffic indoor is increasing rapidly year after year. Such high data rate services indoor calls for innovative wireless techniques such as Multi-User Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) in combination with the future proof optical fiber backhaul infrastructure installation.

Hybrid Fiber-Wireless (Fi-Wi) infrastructure provides mobile terminals (MTs) with dual flexibility of mobility and central- ized controlled networking. Spatially multiplexed data streams for different MTs carried over different optical wavelengths provides clean transport of multi-user multi transmit antenna signal and thus provide multi-user diversity while diminishing the cell sizes, such that the transmit power can be reduced significantly.

The use of Fi-Wi architecture for distributing the radio signals in indoor spaces is growing [2], [3].The hybrid Fi- Wi network described in our paper consists of a fiber in- frastructure, controlled by a central Home Communication  Fig. 1. Hybrid Fiber-Wireless Indoor Architecture  Controller (HCC). The HCC serves as the brain of the network.

Using Radio over Fiber (RoF) technology, the radio signals are distributed across the Cell Access Nodes (CANs) inside rooms to cover the immediate periphery of the indoor network (see Fig.1). This figure is motivated from [4]. The CANs are assumed to be MIMO enabled i.e., they have multiple transmit antennas to either support single user MIMO or MU-MIMO.

MU-MIMO system with perfect Channel State Information at the transmitter (CSIT) can significantly improve the network performance. Due to the difficulty in attaining perfect CSIT owing to a large number of channel parameters to be estimated at the receivers and then fed back to the transmitter, the MIMO systems with imperfect CSI is a more relaxed and realistic as- sumption for today?s network. CSIT with error is a form of par- tial CSIT, which is caused by non-ideal estimation technique or non-ideal feedback. In this paper we present a precoding and scheduling scheme based on maximizing the so called SLNR in presence of channel estimation error. Information theoretic studies show that when the accurate CSI of all users are known at the transmitter, the broadcast channel capacity grows with the number of users at the rate of Nloglog(MK), where N is the number of transmit antennas at the Base Station(BS), M is the number of receive antennas at each user and K is the number of all users. The performance is degraded by reduced SNR due to the deviation caused by imperfect CSIT.

In our paper we investigate the issue of improving the network MU-MIMO capacity under imperfect CSIT while rendering specific MT oriented Quality of Service (QoS). Fig.1 gives a     general overview of the overall network. But to ensure overall improvement we have to ensure improvement over each and every cell area supported by each single multi-antenna element CAN. Here we consider the case of a single cell area served by a single multi-antenna CAN supporting multiple MTs. When perfect channel state information is available at the HCC (CSIT) and MTs (CSIR) the dirty paper coding (DPC) [5] scheme is the optimal capacity attaining scheme for MU- MIMO downlink. DPC is impracticable to implement because of the high computation complexity due to non linearity. Linear beam forming techniques although are suboptimal approaches but they help to reduce the computational complexity. In [6] the authors proposed a precoding scheme based on signal to leakage-noise ratio (SLNR). SLNR is a transmitter side per- formance measure. In comparison with co channel interference (CCI) which represents the amount of signal power received from unwanted MTs to the desired MT, SLNR represents the amount of signal power from the desired MT leaked onto other MTs. It has been shown in [6] that SLNR performs better than a simple zero-forcing (ZF) scheme. With linear beamforming, the number of transmitting antennas should be greater than or equal to all the receiving antennas across all MTs unless time shared. In our Fi-Wi architecture we assume that the number of antennas across all MTs are larger than the number of antennas at the CAN and hence only a subset of MTs get served at a particular time slot. One of the driving objectives for such a hybrid Fi-Wi indoor network architecture is to maximize the system throughput. SINR scheduling in this case serves as the most instinctive objective as maximization of SINR directly relates to maximizing system capacity. SINR is a MT parameter. The work in this paper is an extension of our previous work [1] which accounts for the QoS oriented network capacity improvement under perfect CSIT assumption assuming equal power allocation policy for the users.

Our paper models a downlink MU-MIMO for Fi-Wi indoor environment supporting SLNR precoding and scheduling at the HCC under imperfect CSIT. Based on the MMSE alteration on the imperfect CSIT we obtain a close approximate estimate of the CSIT. For supporting individual QoS across MTs we make use of our previously proposed Fair-SLNR scheduling algorithm [1]. We also propose a mathematical lower bound on the achievable sumrate due to imperfect estimation of CSIT.

Further the comparison of the Fair-SLNR scheme under equal power allocation (EPA) and channel adaptive power alloca- tion (CAPA) is compared in terms of information theoretic parameter network capacity and average network bit error rate. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the system model. Section 3 describes the channel modification using MMSE estimation. Section 4 gives an overview of our Fair-SLNR scheme which was introduced in [1]. Section 5 provides a mathematical lower bound on the achievable sumrate under imperfect CSIT. Section 6 talks about channel adaptive power allocation policy. Section 7 discusses the simulation results and Section 8 concludes the paper summarizing our main results.



II. SYSTEM MODEL  We consider the downlink MU-MIMO scenario for Fi- Wi indoor environment (see Fig.2) where HCC is trying to communicate with K users having one antenna each via a single CAN with N transmit antennas. We assume that  ?????? ????? ? ?? ? ??? 	? ?? ? ? ?? ?? ?? ? ?? ?? ? ??? ?? ? ?? ? ???? ?? ???? ?!? " ?#$?????  ? ???? ?? ???? ?!?

The fiber provides a clean transport of the signal for different antennas across the CAN using different optical wavelength. CAN is used to radiate the signals for different MTs after optical to electrical conversion. As shown in Fig.2 the signals for different MTs generated at the access point (AP) in HCC after SLNR precoding and scheduling are optically modulated onto different wavelengths using Wavelength Divi- sion Multiplexing (WDM). The different optical wavelengths are then transported through the fiber to the CAN where optical to electrical conversion is done at each individual antenna of the CAN and the signal is radiated in the cell area. Different antenna elements across the CAN are thus accessed using different optical wavelengths making the system transparent.

For analysis we assume that the optical channel is perfect and hence introduces no error. Notation: The rest of the paper uses upper case bold face for matrices and lower case bold face for vectors. AT , AH and |A| are used to denote the transpose, hermitian and the Frobenius norm of matrix A respectively.

Let hk(t) ? C1?N denotes the channel gain from the antennas across the CAN to MT k at time t. Quasi-static time variant spatially uncorrelated Rayleigh fading is assumed. Quasi static time varying indoor channel is a good assumption which is validated by [7]. The spatially uncorrelated channel assumption is true as we assume that the separation between the antenna elements in the CAN to be at least half wavelength apart.

For a specific time slot t the transmitted symbol of MT k is given by xk(t). The transmitted symbol is pre-multiplied by a unit norm beamforming precoding vector bk(t). The received signal vector at MT k can thus be written as  rk(t) = hk(t)  K ?  i=1  bi(t)xi(t) + wk(t)  = hk(t)bk(t)xk(t) +  hk(t)  K ?  i6=k  bi(t)xi(t) + wk(t) (1)  where, wk(t) ? N(0, ? 2) represents the additive white Gaus-  sian noise. The power allocation across all the MTs are    assumed equal which we refer as Equal power allocation policy (EPA). We also assume that the signal variance is equal to 1 and the signals for different MTs are not correlated. The SLNR for MT k at time slot t can be given by  SLNRk(t) = |hk(t)bk(t)|   ?2 + ?  i6=k |hi(t)bk(t)|  (2)  In our previous paper [1] we assumed perfect CSIT. But, the assumption that HCC has perfect CSIT is not ideal, so we try to relax the perfect CSIT assumption to an imperfect CSIT with estimation errors at the MTs. In this paper we are however neglecting the imperfection in CSIT caused due to feedback delay. As we assumed that the channels are quasi-static, so the imperfection caused due to feedback delay is assumed to have minimal impact.

A. Error Estimation of Channel  We assume that the techniques used at the MTs for channel estimation is not perfect, and it introduces error. Thus the HCC will obtain CSI with error. Let us denote the perfect CSI as hk(t) for user k at time t, the erroneous estimates as h?k(t) and the divergence between them as the error,  ek(t) = hk(t)? h?k(t) (3)  The distribution of ek(t) are CN (0, ? eI) [8]. The quality of  channel estimation is indicated by the error variance and is assumed to be known to both at the HCC and the MTs.

The degradation in performance of SLNR based scheme is significant due to error estimates in CSI. We can however make minimum mean square error (MMSE) based alteration, so that we obtain a close approximation of the CSI by reducing the effect of estimation error.



III. CHANNEL MODIFICATION  This section aims to estimate a modification matrix of size N ? N using the MMSE based approach to reduce the significant effect of estimation error. For notational simplicity in this part we neglect the time index. Let us denote the channel modification matrix as F and the full channel estimate matrix as H?. The entries of H? includes the imperfect CSI received from the MTs. The equivalent channel matrix after modification can be expressed as,  H? = H?F (4)  The modification matrix Fopt can be obtained by minimizing  MSE = E [  ?  ?H ? H? ?  ?  ]  satisfying power constraint can be  given by,  Fopt = argminTr(F ?F)=1E  [  ?  ?H ? H? ?  ?  ]  (5)  By equating the gradient of the MSE with respect to F and equating to zero we obtain [9],  `Fopt = (K? eI + H  ?H)?1(H?H) (6)  where, H represents the full channel matrix. The obtained F?opt is a global minimizer which can be easily proved by deriving the Hessian matrix and noticing that the Hessian  matrix is positive definite. Normalising `Fopt to satisfy the power constraint gives,  Fopt = `Fopt/  ?  Tr (  `F?opt `Fopt  )  (7)  The minimum mean square error variance becomes [9],  ?2mod = E [  ?  ?H ? H? ?  ?  ]  = ?2e/r r  ?  i=1  ?i/(?i + ? e) (8)  where r is the rank and ?1, .....?r are the non zero eigen values of the full transmit channel covariance matrix Hcov which is given as,  Hcov = E [H ?H] (9)  Therefore after modification to account for the erroneous channel state information the modified SLNR can be given as  SLNRmodk (t)= b?k(t)  (  h? ?  k(t)h?k(t) + ? modI  )  bk(t)  b?k(t) (  ?2I + ?  i6=k ? modI +  ?? H  ?  k ?? Hk  )  bk(t)  (10)  where ?? Hk represents the modified extended channel matrix for  user k obtained after taking into account the imperfection in CSI. Here we also included the time index parameter. The optimal solution for the precoding vector can be given as  b opt k (t) ? maxev  (  h? ?  k(t)h?k(t) + ? modI,  ?2I + ?  i6=k  ?2modI + ?? H  ?  k(t) ?? Hk(t)  )  (11)  The maxev is used to represent the maximum eigen vector.

After obtaining the modified channel estimates and the optimal precoding vectors, the next step is to precode and schedule the MTs. The main goal of this paper is to maximize the network capacity based on SLNR precoding and scheduling under imperfect CSIT taking into account the quality of service(QoS) requirements that each MT demands. The comparative study of the deterioration of the network capacity between perfect and imperfect CSI is presented in this paper.



IV. FAIR-SLNR SCHEDULING  Here in this section we give a brief overview of our previ- ously introduced Fair-SLNR scheduling scheme [1]. Fairness plays a bigger part of network utility. Greedy algorithm can ensure that the total system throughput is maximized while individual MTs throughput requirement is overlooked. In real MU-MIMO broadcast scenarios, HCC is likely to provide a variety of services to different users, each with different QoS requirements. In Fair-SLNR based scheduling , the main goal of the scheduleder is to maximize the system capacity while ensuring that a respectable individual capacity as demanded by the user is guaranteed. For supporting such heterogeneous throughput fairness among users, a throughput fairness metric is defined for user k at time t > 1 as,  ?k(t) = exp (  m C?avg(t)? ak c?k(t)  ? + ak c?k(t)  )  (12)  where, m(m ? 0) is the throughput slope of the exponential function, which determines the sensitivity of the through- put fairness curve. Smaller values of m means less strict    throughput fairness among users and typically give them only average throughput fairness. Indeed, when m = 0 the weighted sum-rate maximization problem reduces to normal sum-rate maximisation problem without any fairness consideration. The scalar valued ak are constants to allow different throughput requirements among users. The variable ? is an appropiate small value for ensuring that the denominator is non-zero. The value c?k(t) is the moving average of past throughput for user k which is updated as,  c?k(t) = (1?  ? )c?k(t? 1) +   ? Ck(t? 1) (13)  where, ? is the smoothing factor, and Ck(t ? 1) is the data rate of user k at time t. The scalar C?avg(t) in (12) is defined as,  C?(t) = (1/K)  K ?  k=1  c?k(t) (14)  Any user with ak c?k(t) > C?(t) has a value less than 1 as its weight. In this case, that user might be excluded from a selected user set for transmission by weighted sum rate max- imisation rule for meeting the throughput fairness constraint among MTs despite its high channel gain.

From time-slot two onwards the scheduling algorithm also takes in account the throughput fairness metric as described by equation (12). So as it is evident from the algorithm proposed, for first iteration the algorithm searches to maximize the throughput fair largest channel gain of user. Once the first MT is chosen in the first iteration, then the algorithm tries to include a single MT in every other iteration based on the maximisation of the Fair-SLNR criterion. In the calculation of Fair-SLNR, only the leakage power to MTs selected in the previous iteration is considered and also the throughput fairness metric for that user. The throughput fairness metric takes the QoS demanded by the user into account. The no. of iterations per time slot is equal to the number of transmitting antennas at the CAN as stated before. After scheduling, the HCC broadcasts data streams of selected users, using leakage- based precoding. For the ease of readability the pseudo code of the algorithm is also provided in this paper which is just a mere abstraction from our previous work [1]. In the algorithm, the imperfect CSIT is however taken into account and modified accordingly. A comparative study on how Fair- SLNR scheduling algorithm fares against the Greedy-SLNR and the Random scheduling scheme can be found in our previous work [1].



V. LOWER BOUND ON ACHIEVABLE SUM-RATE  In this section we provide a lower bound for the achievable sum rate of the system per time-slot. If we replace hk of (1) by h?k as we only have knowledge of modified equivalent channel matrices after MMSE estimation, so we can write it as follow,  r?k(t) = h?k(t)b?k(t)xk(t) +  h?k(t) ?  i6=k  b?i(t)xi(t) + wk(t)  = h?k(t)uk(t) + ?  i6=k  h?k(t)ui(t) + wk(t) (15)  Algorithm 1 Fair-SLNR based scheduling  TIME-SLOT (t=1); Initialization : S(1) = {?}; S?(1) = {1, 2, ....,K}; s1(1) = argmax  k?S?(1)|h?k(1)| 2;  S(1) = S(1) ?  {s1(1)}; S?(1) = S?(1)? {s1(1)}; for j=1:N-1 do  ??Hj(1) = [h? T  s1(1)......h? T  s|S(1)|(1)] T ;  while for each k ? S?(1) do find boptk (1) normalise boptk (1) to unity; find SLNRmodk (1)  end while sj+1(1) = argmax  k?S?(1){SLNRk(1)};  S(1) = S(1) ?  {sj+1(1)}; S?(1) = S?(1)? {sj+1(1)}; end for TIME-SLOT (t=n,n > 1); Initialization : S(n) = {?}; S?(n) = {1, 2, ....,K}; s1(n) = argmax  k?S?(n)?k(n)|h?k(n)| 2;  S(n) = S(n) ?  {s1(n)}; S?(n) = S?(n)? {s1(n)}; for j=1:N-1 do  ??Hj(n) = [h? T  s1(n)......h? T  s|S(n)|(n)] T ;  while for each k ? S?(n) do find boptk (n) normalise boptk (n) to unity; find Fair ? SLNRk(n) = ?k(n) ? SLNRmodk (n)  end while sj+1(n) = argmax  k?S?(n){Fair ? SLNRk(n)};  S(n) = S(n) ?  {sj+1(n)}; S?(n) = S?(n)? {sj+1(n)}; end for  where uk(t) represents the precoded signal that is being transmitted. The data rate of MT k ignoring the time-index can be given as follow,  Ratek = I(uk; r?k) (16)  Now taking ?  i6=k h?kui +wk as the resultant total noise term owing to the interference and the desired MTs receiver noise and representing it as nk we have,  r?k = h?kuk + nk (17)  Thus Ratek can be given as,  Ratek = E?hk log  (  1 + |h?k|2(1/N)  E[nkn?k|h?k]  )  ? E?hk log  (  |h?k| 2(1/N)  E[nkn?k|h?k]  )  (18)  The inequality in equation (18) is because we assume high snr regime. We replaced above E[|uk|  2] by 1/N . Thus,  Ratek ? E?hk log  (  |h?k| 2(1/N)  )  ?  E?hk log  (  E[nkn ? k|h?k]  )  (19)  The inequality in (19) assumes that the resultant noise is Gaussian distributed which is the worst case possible noise distribution. So replacing the resultant distribution with any other distribution will perform better. Applying Jensen?s In- equality we have,    Ratek ? E?hk log  (  |h?k| 2(1/N)  )  ? log (E[nkn ? k]) (20)  Thus, Ratek can be expressed as,  Ratek ? E?hk log  (  |h?|2(1/N) )  ? log  (  ?2E[|h?k| 2] N ? 1  N  )  (21)  Thus the sum rate across the the selected users for a time slot is  Sumrate ? all selected users  ?  E?hk log  (  |h?k| 2(1/N)  )  ?  log  (  ?2E[|h?k| 2] N ? 1  N  )  (22)

VI. CHANNEL ADAPTIVE POWER ALLOCATION  In our previous work [1], SLNR precoding scheme as- sumed that the transmitter distributes equal power to each MT.

But in the real wireless communication system, the channel state of every user is usually different. Thus if the transmit power is allocated according to the real CSI, some gains may be achieved due to the improved power efficiency. For MU- MIMO system, it is believed that the average BER of all users is dominated by the worst one. Therefore considering a channel adaptive scheme based on the SLNR precoding as proposed in [10] can improve the communication quality of the worst user by increasing the transmitted power. SLNR is related to the real CSI and thus it is used in distributing the power adaptively according to the CSI. This we refer to as channel adaptive power allocation policy (CAPA). The detailed power allocation process is described as follows: The transmitted power is allocated according to each user?s SLNR values. The power distributed to each user k is inversely proportional to its SLNR value. It can be denoted as,  pk Ptotal  = 1/SLNRk  ?N  k=1 (1/SLNRk) (23)  where Ptotal is the total transmit power.

VII. SIMULATION RESULTS  The simulations were performed using MATLAB. The parametric values chosen for the simulation are given in the table above. The value of smoothing factor is taken to provide equal weight-age to both the immediate past value of data rate for MTs as well as the past moving average throughput for MTs. The value of ? is chosen to avoid the zero denominator case as mentioned earlier. The value of ak is kept at 1 to provide equal throughput fairness across all the MTs. As we assume that the channels are quasi static time varying , so in the simulations we assume that after every 4 time slots the channel gains change.

We also assumed that the we have imperfect channel knowledge owing to estimation error. The error variance is var- ied between 0.10 to 0.20. We run a Monte-Carlo simulation for 1000 iterations for each scheme and we compare the network capacity in bits/sec/Hz for the schemes with respect to per MT SNR which is given by 1/?2.In Fig. 3 the network capacity in bits/sec/Hz is compared for different values of transmit SNR for the cases comparing perfect CSIT with imperfect CSIT.

We observe a drop of approximately 20 percent in network capacity from the perfect CSIT case when comparing against imperfect CSIT with ?2e equal to 0.10 at 25dB transmit snr.

However as for reasons mentioned earlier in Section 6 we carried out simulations with CAPA and compared it against the EPA policy for both imperfect and perfect CSIT. As we noticed before the drop in network capacity was large for imperfect CSIT case and the gap widens marginally more with CAPA. Its pretty natural as we are trading network capacity for BER by allocating more power to the worst case user. Fig. 4 shows how the network capacity varies for the EPA and CAPA policy for both imperfect and perfect CSIT and Fig. 5 shows how the average network BER varies with the different power allocation policy. We can see that there is a significant improvement of average network BER at high transmit snr. For BER value of 10?7 the imperfect CSIT with CAPA outperforms EPA by 3dB.



VIII. CONCLUSION  In this paper, we considered the case of throughput Fair SLNR precoding and scheduling with Imperfect CSIT due to estimation error. We make a close approximate estimate of the perfect CSI from the imperfect channel knowledge by doing MMSE modification. We provided a comparative measurement showing how much the network capacity suffers owing to imperfection in CSIT. We provided a lower bound on the achievable sum rate per time slot for the imperfect CSIT case.

We even show that in case of imperfect CSIT we can opt for channel adaptive power allocation. It performs better in terms of BER while marginally diminishing network capacity from the EPA scheme with imperfect CSIT.
