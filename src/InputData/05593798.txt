An Improved Template-based Method for Mining Association Rules from Defect Repositories

Abstract?Frequent pattern mining from defect repositories has started playing an important role in software defect detection and analysis[1]. In this paper, we present a new improved template-based method to generate association rules from defect repositories. We aim to provide manager and tester with more efficient method of generating rules. The improved method optimizes the generation using rule templates firstly, then reduces unnecessary rule generation by the theorems described in Section III-A. The advantages of the improved method are validated by an experiment based on 1860 defect reports. The experimental results show the improved template-based method can signifi- cantly reduce the total number of the rules, and shorten the run time. The pruned association rule set makes it easier to find the interesting rules.

I. INTRODUCTION  Software defect repositories contain valuable information which is helpful to improve the process of software de- velopment. Therefore, frequent pattern mining from defect repositories has started playing an important role in software defect detection and analysis[1]. In frequent pattern mining, association rules mining is an important mining task.

Association rules mining was first proposed by Agrawal et al.[2]. The mining task is to discover the relations be- tween items in large databases. Since the first proposal of this new data mining task and its associated efficient mining algorithms, there have been hundreds of follow-up research publications[1]. Thousands of rules may be found if using the classical algorithms without any constraints, but a par- ticular user is interested in only a small subset of them.

Constraint-based mining, which refers to mining only the rules that satisfy user-specified constraints, can reduce the numbers of interesting rules and improve the efficiency of mining rules. Constraint-based mining can include: knowledge type constraints, data constraints, dimension/level constraints, interestingness constraints and rule constraints(template-based constraints)[3]. Literature [4] describes the rule templates in detail.

In our another related literature[5], we mined the association rules with basic Apriori algorithm from defects detected by black-box testing (called black-box defect). In this paper, we propose an improved template-based method for mining  Supported by the National Science Foundation of China No.60970070.

association rules from software defect repositories. The exper- imental results show that the improved method can reduce the number of rules effectively, and has a better performance than basic Apriori algorithm.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the background of template-based association rules mining and rule templates in software defect repositories.

Section III describes our improved method for generating interesting association rules. In Section IV, we present the experiment about the improved method. Finally Section V concludes the paper.



II. BACKGROUND  A. Frequent Itemsets and Association Rules  Let I = {i1, i2, ..., ik} be a set of items. A subset of I is called an itemset or a k-itemset if it contains k items. Let D = {d1, d2, ..., dm} be a set of database transactions where each transaction T is a set of items such that T ? I . Let A be a set of items. A transaction T is said to contain A if and only if A ? T . Frequent itemset A means the support (supp(A)) is greater than user-specified minimum support threshold. And supp(A) is defined as the probability of transactions in the D which contains A.

An association rule is an implication of the form A ? B, where A ? I , B ? I , and A?B = ?. The interestingness of an association rule is usually measured by support and confidence, which respectively reflect the usefulness and certainty of the rule. The support supp(A? B) is the percentage of transac- tions in D that contain A  ? B (both A and B). This is taken to  be the probability, P(A ? B). The confidence conf(A ? B)  is the percentage of transactions in D containing A that also contain B. This is taken to be the conditional probability, P(B|A). That is,  supp(A? B) = P (A ?  B) (1)  conf(A? B) = P (B|A) = supp(A? B) supp(A)  (2)  Rules that satisfy both a minimum support threshold (min- sup) and a minimum confidence threshold (minconf) are called strong association rules. The following example is a typical association rule.

Computer Science & Education Hefei, China. August 24?27, 2010   ThP14.1    Example 1. In a large database of supermarket transactions, an association rule is:  milk ? bread [supp = 30%, conf = 85%].

The support of 30% means that only 30% of the customers have purchased both milk and bread. The confidence of 85% means that 85% of the customers who have purchased milk, also have purchased bread.

In general, association rules mining can be viewed as a two-step process:  1) Find all frequent itemsets: By definition, each of these itemsets will occur at least as frequently as a predeter- mined minimum support.

2) Generate strong association rules from the frequent item- sets: By definition, these rules must satisfy minimum support and minimum confidence.

In this paper, we mainly focus on the second step. The frequent itemsets of the first step can be found by several algorithms, such as basic Apriori algorithm[6].

B. Template-based Association Rules Mining  Template-based mining means user specifies the form of rules to be mined(called rule template). Rule templates may include the maximum or minimum number of predicates that can occur in the rule antecedent or consequent, or as relation- ships among attributes, attribute values, and/or aggregates.

Rule templates are expressions like  A1, ..., Ak ? Ak+1 where each Ai is either an attribute name, a class name or an expression C+ or C?, where C is a class name. Here C+ and C* correspond to one or more and zero or more instances of the class C respectively. If the rule B1, ..., Bh ? Bh+1 can be considered to be an instance of the template A1, ..., Ak ? Ak+1, we call rule B1, ..., Bh ? Bh+1 matches rule template A1, ..., Ak ? Ak+1.

Example 2. In a database of software defect, a defect may be associated with one or more function modules. If tester is interested in function ?Statistics?. In particular, it would be interesting to know the associations where ?Statistics? is one the right hand side and there is another function on the left hand side, such as  Monthly Data? Statistics Such rules match the pattern  Any Function+? Statistics C. Rule Templates in Software Defect Repositories  Software defect reports are usually described in natural language, which include tester, test date, priority, summary, detail description, steps to reproduce and some other related attach files, etc[7]. It can provide manager decision information to improve the process of software development by mining association rules from defect repositories. We only focus on the  black-box defect in this paper. We classify the original defects according to ODC-BD(Orthogonal Defect Classification for Black-box Defect)[8], and then retain tester and test date of the original defect reports. In this paper, we take the following typical rule templates as examples to show our improved template-based method.

Template 1.

Each Tester ? Any DefectType? The template aims to know which kinds of defects are often found by each tester. From the matched rules, managers can see everyone?s testing ability and it is helpful to assign test resources. Furthermore, if adding time constraint, managers can evaluate tester?s work according to different period. For example, an instance is:  TesterA? 212 [supp = 20%, conf = 90%].

Here ?212? is the line number of ODC-BD?s defect type[8], and it refers to ?Message format and content error?. The above rule can show 90% of defects which detected by TesterA are simple error as ?Message format and content error?.

Template 2.

AnyDefectType ? (Condition)? AnyDefectType+ (Result)  The description of one defect usually includes occurred con- dition (data or operation) and result(phenomenon). Therefore, we distinguish whether a defect type is a condition or a result for a certain defect. Template 2 can show which kinds of data or operations easily lead to which kinds of defect phenomenon.

In the instance of Template 2, ?C***? means a defect type is a condition, and ?R***? means a defect type is a result. For example, an instance is:  C68, C106? R209, R221 [supp = 2%, conf = 100%].

Here ?68? means ?Boundary value?, ?106? means ?Name of path/folder/file?, ?209? means ?Prompt/Error message is wrong? and ?221? means ?GUI display error?. The rule indicates when testing the name of path/folder/file with bound- ary value, prompt/error message and GUI display are often incorrect. It reminds tester to use boundary value when testing the name of path/folder/file.



III. IMPROVED METHOD BASED ON RULE TEMPLATES  A. Optimization by Reducing Unnecessary Rule Generation  To optimize the rule generation, we propose the following theorems. The theorems indicate that in what conditions we can reduce unnecessary rule generation, and in what conditions we can not.

Theorem 1. Let X , Y be itemset, and Y 1 be a subset of Y .

If rule X ? Y 1 is not strong, then X ? Y is certainly not strong.

ThP14.1    Proof: By the definition of support, the support of a subset is certainly greater than or equals the support of it?s superset, we have  supp(X ? Y 1) ? supp(X ? Y ) So that,  conf(X ? Y 1) = supp(X ? Y 1) supp(X)  ? supp(X ? Y ) supp(X)  = conf(X ? Y ) Since rule X ? Y 1 is not strong, we have  conf(X ? Y 1) ? minconf and  conf(X ? Y ) ? conf(X ? Y 1) ? minconf Thus rule X ? Y is certainly not strong.

Theorem 2. Let X , Y be itemset, and X1 be a subset of X .

Regardless of whether rule X1? Y is strong, the generation of rule X ? Y can not be optimized.

Proof: By the definition of support, the support of a subset is certainly greater than or equals the support of it?s superset, so we have  supp(X1) ? supp(X) and  supp(X1 ? Y ) ? supp(X ? Y ) The confidence of rule (X1 ? Y ) and (X ? Y ) is defined as follows:  conf(X1? Y ) = supp(X1 ? Y ) supp(X1)  conf(X ? Y ) = supp(X ? Y ) supp(X)  Therefore the size of conf(X1 ? Y ) ? conf(X ? Y ) is uncertain. Thus the generation of rule X ? Y can not be optimized, and it is uncertain whether rule X ? Y is strong until the conf(X ? Y ) is calculated.

B. Method and Algorithm Description  In this section, we present the improved method based on rule templates. The method is divided into three steps.

? Step1: Find all frequent itemsets by any algorithm. Here we use the classical Apriori algorithm to find them.

? Step2: Put proper items into two different sets(e.g.

antecedentSet and consequentSet) according to the left and right hand side of the specified template. Thus, this step optimizes the rule generation with rule templates.

? Step3: Combine every nonempty subset of the antecedentSet and the consequentSet to generate  rules. During combination, apply the theorems presented in Section III-A to reduce the unnecessary rule generation.

The Apriori algorithm in step1 which generates all frequent itemsets can be found in[6], so Algorithm 1 only contains the step2 and step3 in detail.

Input: all frequent itemsets: freqItemSet, minimum confidence: minconf  Output: strong association rules set: ruleSet 1 delete frequent 1-itemset; 2 for each frequent itemset: l in freqItemSet do  // Optimize by rule templates 3 antecedentSet = ?; 4 consequentSet = ?; 5 for each item: i in l do 6 if i matches the left of rule template then 7 add i into antecedentSet; 8 else if i matches the right of rule template then 9 add i into consequentSet;  10 else 11 continue; 12 end 13 end 14 generate all nonempty subsets of antecedentSet; 15 generate all nonempty subsets of consequentSet;  // Optimize by theorems 16 for each subset: setA in antecedentSet do 17 weakItemSet = ?; 18 for each subset: setB in consequentSet do 19 for each weakItem ? weakItemSet; 20 if setB is not superset of weakItem then 21 generate rule setA? setB; 22 calculate the conf(conf ) of  setA? setB; 23 if conf ? minconf then 24 add setA? setB into ruleSet; 25 else 26 add setB into weakItemSet; 27 end 28 end 29 end 30 end 31 end 32 return ruleSet;  Algorithm 1: Improved Algorithm  In addition, to compare with our improved algorithm, we also implement the Apriori rule generation algorithm described in [3].

C. Example Let?s try an example based on Template 2 described in  Section II-C. Suppose l = {C68, C107, R209, R221} is a frequent 4-itemset. What are the association rules that can be generated from l?

ThP14.1    According to the Template 2, the left of the rule should contain ?C***?, and the right of it should contain ?R***?, thus antecedentSet is {C68, C106} and consequentSet is {R209, R221}. The nonempty of antecedentSet are {C68}, {C106} and {C68, C106}. The nonempty of consequentSet are {R209}, {R221} and {R209, R221}. The steps of generating rules are listed in Table I, and let minconf be 60%.

TABLE I EXAMPLE OF RULE GENERATION BY ALGORITHM 1  Rule Conf weakItemSet ruleSet {C68} ? {R209} 50% {R209} ? {C68} ? {R221} 60% {R209} ? {C68} ? {R209, R221} ? ? ? {C106} ? {R209} 72% ? ? {C106} ? {R221} 23% {R221} ? {C106} ? {R209, R221} ? ? ? {C68, C106} ? {R209} 90% ? ? {C68, C106} ? {R221} 75% ? ? {C68, C106} ? {R209, R221} 75% ? ?  For example, due to the confidence of ({C68} ? {R209}) is smaller than minconf(60%), the first rule should not be included in ?ruleSet?, thus the value of column ?ruleSet? is ??? and {R209} is added into weakItemSet. The confidence of the second rule is larger than minconf, so {C68} ? {R221} should be add into ?ruleSet? with ?  ? ?. Then the right hand  side of third rule is a superset of {R209} in weakItemSet, so the rule is reduced according to Algorithm 1 with ???. For this example, the final output ?ruleSet? is {{C68? R221}, {C106 ? R209}, {C68, C106 ? R209}, {C68, C106 ? R221} and {C68, C106? R209, R221}}.



IV. EXPERIMENT To show Algorithm 1 can improve the generation of asso-  ciation rule , we set up the following experiment.

We take Template 2 described in Section II-C as our target  rule template and use the classification result data in [8] as our experimental data. The original defect data include 1660 black- box defect reports distributed in 39 industrial projects and 200 black-box defect reports of open source projects(Eclipse and Firefox).

All the experiments are performed on a 2.40GHz Intel core2 duo PC machine with 2GB memory, running on Microsoft Windows 7. All the programs are written in Java. Fig. 1 compares the total number of association rules generated by Algorithm 1 and Apriori Algorithm. Fig. 1 shows that the improved template-based algorithm can significantly reduce the total number of association rules. Therefore user can find the interesting rules more easily by this method.

Another comparison is run time comparison between Algo- rithm 1 and Apriori Algorithm. Fig. 2 shows that the improved template-based algorithm has a better performance than basic Apriori Algorithm in generating interesting rules.



V. CONCLUSION In this paper we present a new improved template-based  method to generate the association rules. This method is a  Fig. 1.

Firstly, optimize the generation using rule templates which are specified according to user?s special constraints. Then reduce unnecessary rule generation by the theorems presented in Section III-A. To validate the improved method, we apply it in mining rules from software black-box defect repositories. The empirical study shows the improved template-based method can reduce the total number of the rules and the run time comparing with Apriori algorithm. The mined interesting rules is very helpful for software manager and tester.
