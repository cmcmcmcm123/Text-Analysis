Discovering both Positive and Negative Co-location  Rules from Spatial Data Sets*

Abstract- With the explosive growth and extensive applications of spatial data sets, it is becoming more and more important to solve the problem how to discover knowledge automatically from spatial data sets. Co-location patterns discovery is an important branch in spatial data mining. Traditional algorithms for co- location patterns mining can only find positive co-location patterns. However, negative co-location patterns, which are strong negative associated but whose participation index are less than a minimum prevalence threshold, sometimes would include great valuable information. In this paper, the concept of the negative co-location patterns is defined. Based on the analysis of the relationship between negative and positive participation index, methods for negative participation index calculation and negative patterns pruning strategies are given. The methods make it possible to discover both positive and negative co- locations efficiently. The applications of the proposed algorithm are studied using the plant data sets of the ?Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas?. Finally, an extensive experimental analysis is done to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithms.

I.    INTRODUCTION  Co-location patterns? mining is a rising and promising field in spatial data mining. Yet the approaches to discovering co- location patterns in the literatures can only find positive co- location patterns that are prevalent and strong correlated. In fact, many interesting patterns have not been discovered from databases. One of them is a negative co-location pattern which is non-prevalent but strong negative correlated.?  Discovering negative co-location patterns would be significant in certain applications. One application is to mining plants? growing information. Botanists are not only interested in symbiosis, but also mutually exclusive plants. Another application is to identify competing items in business data.

Related Works: In previous works on co-location patterns discovery, the concept of negative co-location patterns has not been discussed yet. For mining positive co-location patterns, Morimoto [1] defined distance-based patterns as k- neighboring class sets. In his work, the number of instances for each pattern was used as the prevalence measure, which   ? * Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No.60463004 and the Research Foundation of the Educational Department of Yunnan Province (No. 09Y0048)  did not possess an anti-monotone property by nature.

Nevertheless, Morimoto used a non-overlapping instance constraint to get the anti-monotone property for this measure.

In contrast, Shekhar and Huang [2] developed an event centric model which abolishes the non-overlapping instance constraint, and a new prevalence measure that has the desirable anti-monotone property called the participation index was defined. At the same time, Huang, Shekhar and Xiong [3] proposed a general mining approach: Join-based approach mining co-location patterns, which established the basis of co-location patterns mining. Yoo and Shekhar developed the partial-join [4] and the join-less [5] algorithms to mining co-location patterns. Wang et al [6] presented a novel algorithm for co-location patterns mining. In their paper, a data structure called CPI-tree (Co-location Pattern Instance Tree) was introduced, which materializes spatial neighbor relationships.

Huang, Pei and Xiong [7] addressed the problem of mining co-location patterns with rare spatial events. In their paper, a new measure called the maximal participation ratio (maxPR) was introduced and a weak monotonicity property of the maxPR measure was identified. Verhein and AI-Naymat [8] studied mining complex spatial co-location patterns from spatial datasets. They introduced the idea of a maximal clique and applied the GLIMIT item-set mining algorithm to their task [9]. Based on the concept of dynamic participation index, Celik et al. studied the zonal co-location patterns discovery problem [10]. Wang et al [11] discusses an order-clique-based method for mining maximal prevalence co-location patterns.

The above approaches mainly focused on the discovery of positive co-location patterns in a spatial database. While in traditional association rules mining, there are some efficient negative rules mining approaches. One approach for mining negative association rules was presented in [12]. This approach needs a user-specified hierarchical structure, which is difficult to be put into practice. An approach based on interest value for both positive and negative association rules mining was proposed in [13]. It used Apriori-like algorithm for generating candidate item-sets, which may bring on missing non-prevalent item-sets that is useful. An approach based on support, confidence and association coefficient for both positive and negative association rules mining was proposed in [14]. Association coefficient need to be adjusted during implementing algorithms. Additionally, this algorithm can?t find all of the negative association rules. A novel effective algorithm for mining negative association rules     called MNAR was proposed in [15]. MNAR can discover all of the negative association rules. In order to reduce the complexity of the support calculation in Apriori-like algorithm, MNAR provided a bit-based method, which introduced a logical operation ?or? in support calculation.

Our Contributions: First, the concepts of negative co- location patterns and rules are defined. Some lemmas are proved, which are used to improve performance of our algorithm. Second, after analyzing the relationship between positive and negative co-location, an algorithm for discovering both positive and negative co-locations is developed. Third, the applications of mining both positive and negative co- locations are studied in the plant data sets of ?Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas?. Finally, we conducted experimental evaluation using a real dataset. The results show that our algorithm is correct and efficient.

Organization: Section 2 gives the basic concepts of negative co-location patterns and rules. Then, based on the analysis of the relationship between negative and positive participation index, some lemmas for negative participation index calculation and improving negative co-locations mining are given.  In Section 3, we present our proposed algorithm for discovering both positive and negative co-location rules.

Section 4 is experimental evaluations. The conclusions and future works are discussed in Section 5.



II.   Basic Concepts and Lemmas   A.    Related Concepts of the Positive Co-locations  Given a set of spatial features F, a set of their instances S, and a spatial neighbor relationship R over S. R could be topological relationships (e.g. linked, intersection), distance relationships (e.g. Euclidean distance metric) and mixed relationships (e.g. the shortest distance of two points on a map). As shown in Fig. 1, there are 4 spatial features A, B, C and D and their instances. A.1 stands for the first instance of feature A. If R is defined as a Euclidean distance metric and its threshold value is d, two spatial objects are neighbors if they satisfy the neighbor relationship:  ? ? ? ?? ?ddistanceR ?? 1.B,1.A1.B,1.A   B.5 B.4  B.1  B.3 A.1  A.2  A.3  A.4 C.1  C.2  C.3  B.2     D.1  D.2                    Fig. 1. An example data set Given a subset of spatial instances ? ?miiiI ,...,, 21	 ,  SI . I is called as an R-neighbor if I forms a clique under the neighbor relation R.

A positive co-location c is a subset of spatial features, i.e., Fc . An R-neighbor I is a row instance of a positive co-  location c if I contains instances of all the features in c and no proper subset of it does so. The table instance of a positive co-location c is the collection of all row instances of c.

The interest degree of a positive co-location differs from the degree of support in traditional association rules mining. A new prevalence measure concept called the participation index is introduced in [3]. Participation ratio will be presented before giving the concept of participation index.

The participation ratio ? ?ifcPR ,  for feature type if  in a size-k positive co-location c= ? ?kff ...1  is the fraction of instances of feature if  which participate in any row instance of co-location c. The participation ratio can be computed as  ? ?ifcPR , = ? ?  ? ?ifancetable_inst cinstancetable  if || )(_?  , where ? is the  relational projection operation with duplication elimination.

The participation index of a positive co-location  c=? ?kff ...1  is the minimum in all ? ?ifcPR ,  of co-location c: ? ?cPI = ? ?? ?iki fcPR ,min 1	 .

Example 1 In Fig. 1, A has 4 instances, B has 5 instances, and C has 3 instances. Two instances are connected with a solid line if they are neighbors. Suppose positive co-location c={A, B, C}, the table instance of co-location c has {{A.2,B.4,C.2}, {A.3,B.3,C.1}, {A.3,B.3,C.2}}. PR(c, A)=2/4 since there are only A.2 and A.3 in the table instance. Similarly, PR(c, B)=2/5, PR(c, C)=2/3. PI(C)=min(PR(c, A), PR(c, B), PR(c, C))=2/5.

Given a minimum prevalence threshold min_prev, a positive co-location c is a prevalent co-location if PI(c ?min_prev holds.

Lemma 1 The participation ratio and the participation index are monotonically non-increasing with the size of the co- location increasing.

Proof Suppose a spatial instance is included in the table instances of co-location c. For co-location cc ' , the spatial instance e must be included in the table instances of 'c . The opposite is not true. Therefore, the participation ratio is monotonically non-increasing.

Suppose },,{ 1 keec ?	 ,  )},({)( 1  1 min ik  k  i k eecPRecPI ?  ?   ?  )},({min 11 ik k  i eecPR ?	 ? )()},({min1 cPIecPR i  k  i ?     Therefore, the participation index of co-location is also monotonically non-increasing.     ?  Lemma 1 ensures that the participation index can be used to effectively prune the search space of co-location pattern mining.

B.    Definitions and Lemmas of the Negative Co-locations Definition 1 (negative co-location patterns) A co-location pattern T is a negative co-location pattern, if  __ YXT 	 , where     X is a set of positive items (positive spatial features), __ Y  is a  set of negative items (negative spatial features), and 1|| ?Y , ?	?YX .

Definition 2 (the PI of negative co-location patterns) the participation index of a negative co-location pattern  __ YXT  is defined as ? ?TPI = ? ?? ?iki XTPR ,min 1	 , where PR (T, Xi) is the participation ratio of spatial feature iX in a negative co- location patterns T.

The participation ratio ? ?iXTPR ,  of spatial feature iX in a  negative co-location __ YXT 	  can be computed as  ? ?iXTPR , = ? ?? ?  ? ?iXancetable_inst Tancetable_inst  iX ||?                (1)  where ?  is the relational projection operation with duplication elimination.

Example 2 Take Fig. 1 as an example, for the negative co- location },,{ DBAT 	 , its PI(T)=min{PR(T, A), PR(T, B)}=0.75, because  PR(T, A) is 0.75 (there are three A?s instances appears in table instances of the negative co-location T) and PR(T, B)  is 0.8.

Definition 3 (prevalence negative co-location patterns) given a minimum prevalence threshold (min_prev), a negative co-location pattern  __ YXT 	 is a prevalence negative co-  location pattern if T meets the following conditions.

(1) prevXPI min_)( ? , prevYPI min_)( ?  and prevYXPI min_)( ? (2) prevTPI min_)( ? .



I.e., in the non-prevalent positive co-location patterns, the  negative co-location patterns that we are interested in are of the form  __  YX  , where FX , FY and they are prevalent.

Example 3 In Fig. 1, if min_prev is set to 0.4, positive co-  location {A, B, D} is non-prevalent. According to Definition 3, negative co-location patterns { DBA ,, }, { DBA ,, }, { DBA ,, } and { DBA ,, } are prevalent. But the negative co-locations { DBA ,, } and { DBA ,, } are non-prevalent since  prevDAPI min_25.0}),({ ?	 .

Lemma 2 Let __ YX   be a candidate prevalence negative co-  location pattern, where },,,{ 21 kXXXX ?	 . If kAAA ?,, 21 are respectively the number of instances of spatial features  kXXX ?,, 21  in the positive co-location YX  , the PI  of negative co-location __ YX   will be:  },,,min{)(    __  k  kk  X AX  X AX  X AX  YXPI ???  ?        (2)  where iX is the number of instances of spatial feature iX .

Proof: Because the PR of each spatial feature in YX  is i  i  X A , the PR of each positive spatial feature in  __ YX   is  i  ii  i  i  X AX  X A ?  ?1 . According to Definition 2,  },,,min{)(    __  n  nn  X AX  X AX  X AX  YXPI ???  ?  holds.

Example 3 Again Fig. 1, for the negative co-location },,{ DBAT 	 , there is only table instance {A.3, B.3, D.1} in  the relevant positive co-location {A, B, D}. By using Lemma 1, PI(T)=min{PR(T, A), PR(T, B)}=min{(1-1/4), (1-1/5)}=0.75.

Lemma 3 Let __ YX ? and  __ YX ??  be prevalence negative co-  location patterns. For prevalence positive co-location pattern XXX ???	 ,  __ YX  must be a prevalence negative co-  location pattern.

Proof: (1) According to conditions of Lemma 2, it is  obviously satisfied that prevYXPIYXPI min_)()( ??? , prevXPI min_)( ?  and prevYPI min_)( ? .

(2) The number iA  of instances of each feature Xi in YX  is no more than the number iB  of instances of each feature Xi  in YX ?  or __ YX ?? ,  i  ii  i  ii  X BX  X AX ?  ? ?  holds. Then,  prev X  BX X  AX YXPI  i  ii  i  ii min_} ||  || min{}min{)(  __ ?  ? ?  ?   Therefore, __ YX   is a prevalence negative co-location  pattern.

Lemma 4 Let __  YX   be a prevalence negative co-location pattern. For a prevalence co-location pattern Z, if ZY holds,  then __ ZX  is also a prevalence negative co-location pattern.

Proof: (1) Because __ YX   is a prevalence negative co-  location pattern and ZY holds, prevYXPIZXPI min_)()( ?? , prevXPI min_)( ?  and  prevZPI min_)( ?  hold.

(2) The number  iA  of instances of each spatial feature Xi in ZX   is no more than the number iB  of instances of each  spatial feature Xi in YX  , then i  ii  i  ii  X BX  X AX ?  ? ?  holds. Since  __ YX   is a prevalence negative co-location,  prevYXPI min_)( __  ? holds, then  prevYXPI X  BX X  AX ZXPI  i  ii  i  ii min_)(}min{}min{)( ____  ? ?  ? ?   holds, i.e.,  prevZXPI min_)( __  ?  holds. Therefore, __  ZX  is also a prevalence negative co-location pattern.

A large number of candidate negative co-locations can be pruned by Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 (They will be sent to the prevalence negative co-location set directly.).

Definition 4 (conditional probability) The conditional probability )(  __  YXCP ? of a negative co-location rule __  YX ?  is the fraction of row instances of X which have not neighbor relationships with row instances of Y, i.e.,     )(1 })({instance  }))({instance( 1)(  __  YXcp Xtable  YXtable YXCP X ??  ?  ? ?	?  ? ,  where ? is the relational projection operation with duplication elimination.

Definition 5 (negative co-location rules) __ YX ? is a  negative co-location rule (or called a strong negative co-  location rule) if __ YX  is a prevalence negative co-location  pattern and the conditional probability of __ YX ? is more than  a conditional probability threshold (min_conf) defined by users.

C.    Difficulties in Discovering Negative Co-location Patterns  (1) The spatial computation is time-consuming Since the instances of spatial features are embedded in a  continuous space and share complex spatial relationships, a large fraction of the spatial computation cost is devoted to identifying the spatial instances and relationships between spatial instances.

(2) The existent algorithms can?t be reused First of all, the negative association rules mining algorithms  can not be reused in mining negative co-location patterns since there are no traditional ?transactions? in spatial data sets. Also, algorithms of positive co-location mining can not be used directly since some methods must be redesigned (such as calculating the PI).

(3) Generating negative co-location patterns is time- consuming  The number of candidate negative co-location patterns increases exponentially with the size of data sets.



III.   Mining both Positive and Negative Co-locations  First, the method of calculating the PI of a candidate negative co-location based on the relevant positive co- location?s instances is given by Lemma 2.  Thus, the algorithm is designed to mining both positive and negative co-locations.

Moreover, Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 are the guarantees of performing a large number of prunings.

Second, all spatial features are size-1 prevalent co-locations according to the definition of the participation index measure.

In order to make the candidate co-locations? set closer to the prevalent co-locations? set, size-(k-1) prevalent co-locations join with each other to generate candidate co-locations in positive co-location mining algorithms. However, negative co- location patterns are generated by non-prevalent co-locations.

In order to guarantee that all positive and negative prevalent co-locations could be discovered, the size-k candidate co- locations are generated by joining the size-(k-1) and size-1 prevalent co-locations.

Finally, the new algorithm has four phases. The first phase computes neighborhood relationships between spatial instances, and finds neighborhood relationship set of each spatial instance (star neighborhoods).  The second phase generates size-k positive and negative candidate co-locations.

The third phase uses the ideas of the Apriori-like and the join- less algorithm to generate size-k positive prevalent co-  locations. The fourth phase generates size-k negative candidate co-locations, and then discovers prevalent negative co-locations and negative rules.

Algorithm 1 is described as followings.

Input: F=? ?nfff ..., 21 : a set of spatial feature types; S: a set of spatial  instances <feature type, feature instance id, location>; R: spatial neighbor relationship (e.g., Euclidean distance); min_prev: prevalence threshold; min_conf: conditional probability threshold;  Output: PL: strong positive co-location rules; NL: strong negative co- location rules;  Variables: NT=? ? nfff  NTNTNT ...,  : a set of spatial neighbor  relationships where if  NT is the set of neighbor instances of the spatial  feature if ; k: co-location size; kH : a set of size-k positive and negative candidate co-locations; kC : a set of size-k positive candidate co-locations; Tk: a set of table instances of co-locations in Ck; kP : a set of size-k positive prevalent co-locations; kQ : a set of size-k positive co-location rules; kL : a set of size-k negative candidate co-locations;  kB : a set of size-k negative  prevalent co-locations; kI : a set of size-k negative co-location rules; Steps: (1) ??PL ; ??NL ; FP 	1 ; ??1B ; (2) NT  near(F, S, R); // Spatial computations are performed in this procedure.

In fact, the step converts a spatial data set S to a set of disjoint star neighborhoods NT.

In this step, we delete all candidate co-locations kHc ?  such that some size k-1 subset of c is not in Pk-1. In this  procedure, the multiresolution pruning method proposed in [3] can be used for spatial datasets with strong autocorrelation, i.e.

where instances tend to be located near each other.

(2) Step (3.3) generates table instances set Tk of candidate co-locations set Ck based on the spatial neighbor relationships set NT.  In this step, first, generate coarse table instances of a     candidate co-location by gathering from the ifNT  if the first  feature of the candidate co-location is if . Second, filter co- location instances by looking up all instances of the co- location of features except the first feature of the candidate co- location. For example, to check the coarse instance {A.1, B.1, C.1} of co-location {A, B, C}, we examine whether the sub- instance {B.1, C.1} except A.1 is in the table instances set of co-location {B, C}.

(3) Step (3.7) generates all prevalent negative co-locations.

It is time-consuming. The cause is that the negative items of each non-prevalent co-location will be combined to identify prevalent negative co-locations. For example, suppose the co- location {A, B, D} is a non-prevalent co-location, then we have to combine negative co-locations },,{ DBA , },,{ DBA ,  },,{ DBA , },,{ DBA , },,{ DBA , ?, and to identify sub-co- locations AB, BD, AD are prevalent or not, and then to calculate the PI of them respectively. This process can be improved due to pruning based on Lemma 3 and Lemma 4.



IV.   Experimental Evaluation  We evaluated the performance and application values of Algorithm 1 with a real-world plant distribution data set that contains distribution information of plant species in the ?Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas? area. All experiments were conducted on a 3-GHz Pentium PC computer with 2G megabytes main memory, running the  Microsoft Windows XP operating system. All programs were implemented in Java.

In the plant dataset, the number of plant species (spatial feature types) is 16. Three parameters, namely number of plant instances (n), prevalence threshold (min_prev), and spatial neighbor distance threshold (d), were varied during the experiments for verifying the effects of parameters and the performance of Algorithm 1.

A.    Effect of the Number of Spatial Instances  We examined the performance of Algorithm 1 with the number of spatial instances. First, we compared Algorithm 1 with the algorithm which only mines the positive co-locations.

As shown in Fig. 2(a), the algorithms execution time significantly increased with the increment of the number of spatial instances. At the same time, the gap between the two algorithms becomes wider. This is because the increments of table instances and star neighborhoods set NT. Notice the differences in the number of positive and negative co- locations, and that of pruned co-locations by using Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 in Fig. 2(b). As can be seen, the result of using Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 in Algorithm 1 is very obvious. In the experiments, the parameters d and min_prev is set to 25 and 0.15 respectively.

Because of a bigger d and a smaller min_prev, the number of negative co-locations is tremendous when the number of spatial instances is 11300. It is important to set reasonable parameters in both positive and negative co-locations mining.

(a) (b) Fig. 2. Effect of the number of spatial instances: (a) running time comparison, (b) the number of positive and negative co-locations   B.    Effect of Parameters min_prev and d  The following experiments examined the effect of the parameters min_prev and d. Fig. 3 illustrates the effect of the min_prev for the running time and the numbers of positive and negative co-locations, while Fig. 4 shows that of the neighbor distance d for the running time and the numbers of positive and negative co-locations. In the experiments, the number of plant instances is 6000. The parameter d is set to 20 in  experiments of Fig. 3. The parameter min_prev is set to 0.3 in experiments of Fig. 4. According to the figures, it can be seen that the effect of two parameters in Algorithm 1 is much greater than that in only positive co-locations mining. This means that the reasonable parameter setting is more important in both positive and negative co-locations mining. At the same time, we can notice that the effect of pruning by Lemma 3 and 4 is significant.

Analysis of the Application Values (1) Discovery of the precious and rare plants by the negative rules  We can discover precious and rare plants in the ?Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas? by the negative rules, because they appear in many negative rules in the form of negative-item. At the same time, if they appear in the positive rules in the form of rule?s left-item, we can find that their conditional probability values are almost 1 (100%). For example, from the negative rules, we notice that the plant R.

sulphureum and the plant R. brachyanthum appear in many negative rules in the form of negative-item. In fact, these two Rhododendrons are very rare in this area. The positive rules contained them represent their growing community (or conditions). According to these positive rules, the rare plants? growing conditions should be protected.

(2) Discovery of exotic species by the negative rules The discovery of exotic species sometimes is a dangerous  signal. We find two exotic species appear in negative rules in the form of negative-item, but they are not in any of positive rules. This is another contribution of negative rules.

(3) The alarms coming from the negative rules From the mining results, we find that there are many  Rhododendrons and Arethusas that appear in negative rules in the form of negative-item. In fact, the region where the Rhododendrons and the Arethusas grow is very beautiful and is a famous tourist resort. The discovery of these negative rules alarms to the traveling administration.



V.   Conclusions and Future Work   In this paper, we discussed concepts of negative co-location patterns and designed an algorithm for mining both positive and negative co-locations. In traditional algorithms for positive co-locations mining, some co-locations may be eliminated if they contain spatial features which have rare spatial instances. But using the algorithm proposed by this paper, the useful co-location rules are discovered as negative rules.

In the future, more reasonable prevalence thresholds and conditional probability thresholds will be studied. In order to find more useful rules, the different thresholds of positive co- locations and negative co-locations need to be set. For example, when generating higher-size negative rules, conditional probability threshold should be set higher, because it increases with the number of features.
