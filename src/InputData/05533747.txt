An Improved Algorithm for Frequent Patterns Mining Problem

Abstract?Frequent pattern mining is a basic problem in data mining and knowledge discovery. The discovered patterns can be used as the input for analyzing association rules, mining sequential patterns, recognizing clusters, and so on. However, discovering frequent patterns in large scale datasets is an extremely time consuming task.

Most research in the area of association rule discovery has focused on the method of efficient frequent pattern discovery, e.g. Park, Chen & Yu (1995); Savasere, Omiecinski & Navathe (1995); Han, Pei & Yin (2000); Pei, Han, Lu, Nishio, Tang & Yang (2001). When seeking all associations that satisfy constraints on support and confidence, once frequent patterns have been identified, generating the association rules is trivial. In the last decade, various algorithms have been proposed on this problem, e.g.

maximal pattern mining ? Grahne & Zhu (2003); closed pattern mining ? Pei, Han & Mao (2000); Grahne & Zhu (2003); mining the most interesting frequent patterns ? Fu, Kwong & Tang (2000); Han, Wang, Lu & Tzvetkov (2002, 2005); Hirate, Iwahashi & Yamana (2004). However, some challenges are still existed and need to be overcome.

In this paper, a mathematical space will be introduced with some new related concepts and propositions to design a new algorithm for solving frequent patterns mining problem. It is hoped that such an improved algorithm will be simple to implement and more efficient.

I.  SPACE OF BOOLEAN CHAINS  Let B = {0,1}, Bm is the space of m-tuple Boolean chains, whose elements are s = (s1, s2, .. , sm), si ? B, i = 1,..,m.

A. Definitions  A Boolean chain a = (a1, a2, .. , am) is said to cover another Boolean chain b = (b1, b2, .. , bm) ? or b is covered by a, if for each i ? {1,..,m} the condition bi = 1 implies that ai = 1. For instance, (1,1,1,0) covers (0,1,1,0).

Let S be a set of n Boolean chains. If there are k chains in S covering a chain u = (u1, u2, .. , um) then u is called a form with a frequency of k in S and [u; k] is called a pattern of S. For instance, if S = ? (1,1,1,0), (0,1,1,1), (0,1,1,0), (0,0,1,0), (0,1,0,1) ? then u = (0,1,1,0) is a form with a frequency 2 in S and [(0,1,1,0); 2] is a pattern of S.

A pattern [u; k] of S is called a maximal pattern if and only if the frequency k is the maximal number of Boolean chains in S. In the above instance, [(0,1,1,0); 3] is a maximal pattern in S.

The set P of all maximal patterns in S whose forms are not covered by any form of other maximal pattern, is called a representative set and each element of P is called a representative pattern of S.

Based on this definition, the following proposition is trivial:  Proposition 1: Let S be a set of m-tuple Boolean chains and P be the representative set of S, then any couple of two elements in P are not coincided.

By listing all of n elements of the set S of m-tuple Boolean chains in a Boolean n?m matrix, each element [u; k] of the representative set forms a maximal rectangle with maximal height of k in S set.

For instance, if S = ? (1,1,1,0), (0,1,1,1), (1,1,1,0), (0,1,1,1), (0,0,1,1) ?, then representative set of S consists of five representative patterns: P = { [(1,1,1,0); 2], [(0,1,1,0); 4], [(0,0,1,0); 5], [(0,1,1,1); 2], [(0,0,1,1); 3] }.

All of five elements of S are listed in a form of Boolean 5?4 matrix, as follows:  A 5x4 matrix: and [(0,1,1,0); 4]: 1 1 1 0  1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1  0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0  1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1  0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1  0 0 1 1  Figure 1. A 5x4 matrix for [(0,1,1,0); 4].

Figure 1 shows a maximal rectangle with boldface 1s and a maximal height of 4 corresponding to the pattern [(0,1,1,0); 4]. Other maximal rectangles formed by elements of P are  [(1,1,1,0); 2]:  [(0,0,1,0); 5]:  1 1 1 0  1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1  0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0  1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1  0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1  0 0 1 1  Figure 2. Matrices for [(1,1,1,0); 2] and [(0,0,1,0); 5].

2010 International Symposium on Computer, Communication, Control and Automation     [(0,1,1,1); 2]:  [(0,0,1,1); 3]:  1 1 1 0  1 1 1 0  0 1 1 1  0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0  1 1 1 0  0 1 1 1  0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1  0 0 1 1  Figure 3. Matrices for [(1,1,1,0); 2] and [(0,0,1,1); 3].

A noteworthy case of the above instance: [(1,1,0,0); 2] is a maximal pattern, but it is not a representative pattern of S because its form is covered by (1,1,1,0) of the pattern [(1,1,1,0); 2].

B. Binary Relations  Let a = (a1, a2, .. , am) and b = (b1, b2, .. , bm) be two m- tuple Boolean chains, then a = b if and only if ai = bi for any i = 1,..,m. Otherwise, it is denoted by a ? b.

Given patterns [u; p] and [v; q] in S, [u; p] is contained in [v; q] ? denoted by [u; p] ? [v; q], if and only if u = v and p ? q. To negate, the operator ! is used e.g. [u; p] !? [v; q]  The minimum chain of a, b ? denoted by a ? b, is a chain z = (z1, z2, .. , zm) determined by z = a ? b where zk = min(ak, bk) with k = 1,..,m.

The minimum pattern of [u; p] and [v; q] is a pattern [w; r], denoted by [u; p] ? [v; q], defined as follows: [u; p] ? [v; q] = [w; r] here w = u ? v and r = p + q.



II. AN IMPROVED ALGORITHM  A. Theorem 1: for Adding a New Element  Given S be a set of m-tuple Boolean chains and P representative set of S. For [u; p], [v; q]? P and z 	 S, let [u; p] ? [z; 1] = [t; p+1], [v; q] ? [z; 1] = [d; q+1]. Only one of the following cases must be satisfied:  i. [u; p] ? [t; p+1] and [u; p] ? [d; q+1], t = d ii. [u; p] ? [t; p+1] and [u; p] !? [d; q+1], t ? d iii. [u; p] !? [t; p+1] and [u; p] !? [d; q+1].

Proof: From Proposition 1, obviously u ? v. The theorem is proved if the following claim is true: Let  (a): u = t , u = d , and t = d;  (b): u = t , u ? d , and t ? d;  (c): u ? t and u ? d,  only one of the above statements is correct.

By the method of induction on the number m of entries of chain, in the first step, we show that the claim is correct if u and v differ at only one kth entry.

Without loss of generality, we assume that uk = 0 and vk = 1. The following cases must be true:  - Case 1: zk = 0; Then min(uk, zk) = min(vk, zk) = 0, hence t = u ? z = (u1, u2, .. , 0, .. , um) ? (z1, z2, .. , 0, .. , zm) = (x1, x2, .. , 0, .. , xm), xi = min(ui, zi), for i = 1,..,m, i?k;  d = v ? z = (v1, v2, .. , 1, .. , vm) ? (z1, z2, .. , 0, .. , zm) = (y1, y2, .. , 0, .. , ym), yi = min(vi, zi), for i = 1,..,m, i?k.

From the assumption ui = vi when i ? k thus xi = yi, so t = d. Hence, if u = t then u = d and (a) is correct. On the other hand, if u ? t then u ? d, therefore (c) is correct.

- Case 2: zk = 1; We have min(uk, zk) = 0, min(vk, zk) = 1 and t = u ? z = (u1, u2, .. , 0, .. , um) ? (z1, z2, .. , 1, .. , zm) = (x1, x2, .. , 0, .. , xm), xi = min(ui, zi), for i = 1,..,m, i?k;  d = v ? z = (v1, v2, .. , 1, .. , vm) ? (z1, z2, .. , 1, .. , zm) = (y1, y2, .. , 1, .. , ym), yi = min(vi, zi), for i = 1,..,m, i?k.

So, t ? d. If u = t then u ? d, thus the statement (b) is correct.

In summary, the above claim is true for any u and v of S that differ only at one entry.

By induction in the second step, it is assumed that the claim is true if u and v differ at r entries, and only one of the three statements (a), (b) or (c) is true.

Without loss of generality, we assume that the first r entries of u and v are different, and they differ at (r+1)-th entries. Applying the same method in the first step where r = 1 to this instance, it is obtained    True statements when u ? v,  and their first r entries are different:  True statements when u ? v,  and their first r+1  entries are different:  True statements  when combining  the two possibilities:  (a) (a) (a)  (a) (b) (b)  (a) (c) (c)  (b) (a) (b)  (b) (b) (b)  (b) (c) (c)  (c) (a) (c)  (c) (b) (c)  (c) (c) (c)  Figure 4. Cases in comparision.

Therefore, if u and v are different at r+1 entries, only one of the (a), (b), (c) statements is correct. The above claim is true, and Theorem 1 is proved.

B. Algorithm: for Finding a New Representative Set  Let S be a set that consists of n m-tuple Boolean chains, and P the representative set of S. If a m-tuple Boolean chain z is added to S, the following algorithm is used to determine the new representative set of S {z}:    ALGORITHM NewRepresentative( P , z ) // Finding new representative set for S when one chain  is added to S.

// Input: P is a representative set of S, z: a chain added to S.

// Output: The new representative set P of S {z}.

1. M = ? // M: set of new elements of P 2. flag1 = 0  3. flag2 = 0  4. for each x ? P do 5.  q = x ? [z; 1] 6.  if q ? 0 // q is not one chain with all elements 0  7.   if x ? q then P = P \ ?x? 8.   if [z; 1] ? q then flag1 = 1 9.   for each y ? M do 10.    if y ? q then 11.     M = M \ ?y? 12.     break for  13.    endif  14.    if m ? y then 15.     flag2 = 1  16.     break for  17.    endif  18.   endfor  19.  else  20.   flag2 = 1  21.  endif  22.  if flag2 = 0 then M = M ?q? 23.  flag2 = 0  24. endfor  25. if flag1 = 0 then P = P ? [z; 1] ? 26. P = P M 27. return P  C. Theorem 2: for Finding Representative Sets  Let S be a set of n m-tuple Boolean chains. The representative set of S is determined by applying NewRepresentative algorithm to each of n elements of S in turn.

Proof: This theorem is proved by induction on the number n of elements of S.

Firstly, when applying the above algorithm to the set S of only one element, this element is added into P and then P with that only element is the representative set of S.

Thus, Theorem 2 is proved in the case of n = 1.

Next, assume that S consists of n elements, the above algorithm is applied to S, and it is obtained a representative set P0 of p patterns. Each element of P0 allows to form a maximal rectangle from S. When adding a new m-tuple Boolean chain z to S, it is necessary to prove that the algorithm allows to find a new representative set P of S  {z}.

Indeed, with z, some new rectangle forms will be formed along with the existing rectangle forms. But some of these new rectangle forms which are covered by other rectangle forms, the so-called ?redundant? rectangles, need to be removed to gain P.

The fifth statement in the NewRepresentative algorithm shows that the operator ? is applied to z and p elements of  P0 to produce p new elements belonging to P. This means z ?scans? all elements in the set P0 to find out new rectangle forms when adding z into S. Consequently, three groups of 2p+1 elements in total are created from the sets P0, P, and z.

To remove redundant rectangles, we have to check whether each element of P0 is contained by elements of P or not, and elements of P contain other one, in which z is an element in P.

Let x be an element of P0 and consider the form x ? z, there are two instances: if the form of z covers the one of x then x is a new form; or if the form of x covers the one of z then z is a new form. Anyway, the frequency of the new form is always one unit greater than frequency of the original.

According to Theorem 1, with x ? P0, if some pattern w contains x then w must be a new element which belongs to P, and that new element is q = x ? [z; 1]. To check whether x is contained by elements belonging to P, we do that whether x is contained by q or not. If x contained by q, it must be removed from the representative (line 7).

In summary, first the algorithm checks whether elements belonging to P0 is contained by elements belonging to P. Then, the algorithm checks whether elements of P contain one other (from line 9 to line 18), and whether [z; 1] is contained by elements belonging to P or not (line 8).

Finally, the above NewRepresentative algorithm can be used to find new representative set when adding new elements to S.



III. A CASE STUDY  A. Association Rule Discovery  Advanced technologies have enabled us to collect large amounts of data on a continuous or periodic basis in many fields. On one hand, these data present the potential for us to discover useful information and knowledge that we could not find before. On the other hand, we are limited in our ability to manually process large amounts of data to discover useful information and knowledge. This limitation demands automatic tools for data mining to mine useful information and knowledge from large amounts of data. Data mining has become an active area of research and development.

Association rules ? a data mining methodology that is usually used to discover frequently co-occurring data items, for example, items that are commonly purchased together by customers at grocery stores. Association rule discovery problem were introduced in 1993 by Agrawal [13]. Since then, this problem has received much attention.

Today the exploitation such rules is still one of the most popular way for exploiting pattern in order to conduct knowledge discovery and data mining.

Exactly, association rule discovery is the process discovering sets of value of attribute appearing frequently in data objects. From the frequent patterns, association rules can be created in order to reflect the ability of appearing simultaneously the value of attribute in the set of objects. To bring out the meaning, an association rule of X ? Y reflects the occurrence of the set X conduces to the    appearance of the set Y. In other words, an association rule indicates an affinity between X (antecedent) and Y (consequent). An association rule is accompanied by frequency-based statistics that describe that relationship.

The two statistics that were used initially to describe these relationships were support and confidence [13].

The apocryphal example is a chain of convenience stores that performs a analysis and discovers that disposable diapers and beer are frequently bought together [7]. This unexpected knowledge is potentially valuable as it provides insight into the purchasing behavior of both disposable diaper and beer purchasing customers for the convenience store chain. So that, we can find association rules help identify trends in sales, customer psychology, etc. to make strategic layout item, business, marketing, and so on.

In short, the association rule discovery can be divided into two parts:  ? Finding all frequent patterns that satisfy min- support.

? Finding all association rules that satisfy minimum confidence.

Most research in the area of association rule discovery has focused on the sub-problem of efficient frequent pattern discovery (for example, Han, Pei, & Yin, 2000; Park, Chen, & Yu, 1995; Pei, Han, Lu, Nishio, Tang, & Yang, 2001; Savasere, Omiecinski, & Navathe, 1995).

When seeking all associations that satisfy constraints on support and confidence, once frequent patterns have been identified, generating the association rules is trivial.

B. The Methods of Finding Frequent Patterns  ? Candidate Generation Methods: for instance, Apriori method proposed by Agrawal in piece of research [13]?[7], and algorithms rely on Apriori such as AprioriTID, Apriori-Hybrid, DIC, DHP, PHP,... in [3]?[4]?[7].

? Without Candidate Generation Methods: for example, Zaki?s method relies on IT-tree and intersection part of Tidsets in order to reckon support, [3]; or J. Han?s one relies on FP-tree in order to exploit frequent patterns, [8]?[5]; or methods Lcm, DCI, ... presented in [8].

? Paralleled Methods: instances in [11]?[12].

C. Issues Need to be Solved  ? Working with the varying database is the biggest challenge. Especially, it need not scan again the whole database whenever having need of adding a new element.

? A number of algorithms are effective, but their basis of mathematics and way of installation are complex.

? The limit of computer memory. Hence, combining how to store the data mining context most effectively with costing the memory least and how to store frequent patterns is also not a small challenge.

? Ability of dividing data into several parts for paralleled processing is also concerned.

Using the NewRepresentative algorithm is making good the above problems.

D. Data Mining Context  Let O be a limited non-empty set of invoices, and I a limited non-empty set of goods. Let R be a binary relation between O and I so that: for o ? O and i ? I, (o, i) ? R if and only if the invoice o includes the i-th goods. Then R is a subset of the product set O?I, and the trio (O, I, R) describes a data mining context.

For example, we have a context which is illustrated in Table I, consisted of five invoices with the codes oj, j = 1,..,5 and four kinds of goods ik, k = 1,..,4. The corresponding binary relation R is described in Table II which can be represented by a 5?4 Boolean matrix.

TABLE I. INVOICE DETAILS  Invoice code  Goods code  o1 i1  o1 i2  o1 i3  o2 i2  o2 i3  o2 i4  o3 i2  o3 i3  o3 i4  o4 i1  o4 i2  o4 i3  o5 i3  o5 i4  TABLE II. BOOLEAN MATRIX OF DATA MINING CONTEXT  i1 i2 i3 i4  o1 1 1 1 0  o2 0 1 1 1  o3 0 1 1 1  o4 1 1 1 0  o5 0 0 1 1  E. Applying the NewRepresentative Algorithm  The tenor of the algorithm is to find out new rectangle forms created by applying the operator ? to corresponding line of data of current step and rectangle forms found in prior steps. However, in the first step, grouping the data mining context in order to gain the first evident rectangle forms and their corresponding height is a need. In per step, if the rectangle form created newly covers an existent rectangle form then removing the old rectangle form is necessary. Besides, it also needs to remove the newly created rectangle form if they mutually cover.

In summary, after per step, the set P whose elements differ mutually is created. This means to achieve various maximal rectangle forms in the database, as from the first line of data to the line of data corresponding to the current step.

Based on the Boolean matrix that represents a data mining context in Table II with a minsupp of 40%, after grouping, three evident forms or Boolean chains with corresponding frequencies are listed in Table III.

TABLE III. FORMS AND FREQUENCIES OF THE CONTEXT  Line Form  Frequency  1. 1110 2  2. 0111 2  3. 0011 1  Let P be the set of maximal rectangle forms of that Boolean matrix. It can be determined by following steps:  - Step 1: Consider the 1st line, put the form (1,1,1,0) and its frequency into P, we obtain  P = ? [(1,1,1,0); 2] ?.

- Step 2: Consider the 2nd line with a pattern [(0,1,1,1);  2]. In order to find a new set P, we have to determine a minimum pattern of the existing old element [(1,1,1,0); 2] and this new pattern. If the existing old pattern is contained by the new element pattern, the old element must be removed.

But [(1,1,1,0); 2] ? [(0,1,1,1); 2] = [(0,1,1,0); 4], therefore [(1,1,1,0); 2] and [(0,1,1,1); 2] are not contained by [(0,1,1,0); 4]. So,  P = ? [(1,1,1,0); 2] (1) // the old element of P [(0,1,1,0); 4] (2) // the new element just created  [(0,1,1,1); 2] (3) ? // this new pattern is not contained by [(0,1,1,0); 4].

- Step 3: Consider line 3, find minimum patterns between [(0,0,1,1); 1] and three existing old elements of P, we have:  [(1,1,1,0); 2] ? [(0,0,1,1); 1] = [(0,0,1,0); 3] [(0,1,1,0); 4] ? [(0,0,1,1); 1] = [(0,0,1,0); 5] [(0,1,1,1); 2] ? [(0,0,1,1); 1] = [(0,0,1,1); 3] The pattern [(0,0,1,1);1] must be removed because it is  contained by [(0,0,1,1);3]. Similarly, the first pattern [(0,0,1,0);3] is removed because this is contained by [(0,0,1,0); 5], So, we obtained:  P = ? [(1,1,1,0); 2] (1) [(0,1,1,0); 4] (2)  [(0,1,1,1); 2] (3)  [(0,0,1,0); 5] (4)  [(0,0,1,1); 3] (5) }  Now, the elements of P are the maximal rectangle forms, representing the Boolean matrix expressing data mining context. The frequent patterns satisfy minsupp = 40% (2/5) is listed:  ?  ?i2, i3, i4? (2/5);   ?i3, i4? (3/5);   ?i1, i2, i3? (2/5); ?i2, i3? (4/5)  ?

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  This research proposed the improved algorithm for mining frequent patterns. It ensures a number of the following requests:  ? To solve adding data into the data mining context in which scanning again the database is unnecessary.

? To install easy and the low complexity (n22m, where n is number of invoices and m is number of goods. In reality, m is not varying and thus 22m is considered a constant).

? The representative set P created deputies mainly for the data mining context. So, sometimes, to save the capacity of computer memory, it needs only to store the P set instead of the whole context.

? To surmount the limit of computer memory not enough for storing the enormous data mining context. Because the algorithm allows classifying the context into several parts for processing one by one.

? Applying simply paralleled strategy to the algorithm.

A number of problems need studying further:  ? Expanding the algorithm for the circumstance of altering data.

? Improving the rate of the algorithm.

? Investigating for applying the algorithm to the real  works.
