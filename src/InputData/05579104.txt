A New Association Rule Mining Algorithm and Its Application

AbstractThis paper presents a new association rule mmmg algorithm called MFP. The MFP algorithm can convert a transaction database into an MFP _tree through scanning the database only once, and then do the mining of the tree. The MFP algorithm usually is more efficient than FP_growth. We used it for mining some formulas of synthetic perfume essence and obtained the success.

I. INTRODUCTION  Association rule mining belongs to data mining area. It is used to search for interesting relationship among items in a large transaction database[  IJ. Boolean association rule mining is used more widely than other kinds of association rule mining. Its whole mining process can be completed in three steps. Firstly, the database which will be mined are transformed into a transaction database. And then, some mining method is used to mine out all candidate frequent patterns. At last, the association rules are created from the candidate frequent patterns. The second stage is the most important. It will decide the correctness and efficiency of the mining process. There are two mining algorithms which are widely used to mine association rules. One is Apriori; the other is FP ?rowth[ 3J. FP _growth algorithm is more efficient than Apriori. Some related research showed that FP ?rowth algorithm is about one order of magnitude faster than the Apriori[4J. The larger the transaction database, the higher FP ?rowth's efficiency. The main reason is that Apriori algorithm need scan transaction database being mined several times and FP _growth algorithm need to scan the database only twice.

FP _growth algorithm is used to mine transaction database for Boolean association frequent patterns. Its mining process is quite complicated, and can be divided into three basic stages. The first stage is to scan the transaction database being mined and construct a L table with the value of min_sup given. The second stage is to scan the transaction database again, and build an FP _tree. The last stage is to mine the FP _tree, and search for all candidate frequent patterns. After we get the patterns, we can construct all association rules from them easily.

Although FP _growth algorithm is more efficient than Apriori algorithm, it has to scans the transaction database twice. The first time, an L table is created. The second time, an FP tree is built. The cost of scanning a transaction database is usually very high. If we can decrease the number of scan times of association rule mining algorithms, the algorithms will be even more efficient than FP _growth. We design a fast association rule mining algorithm called MFP algorithm. MFP algorithm firstly scans a transaction database and converts the database into MFP tree which is similar to FP _tree, and then, the algorithm mines MFP _tree to find all possible candidate frequent patterns. Comparing with FP _growth algorithm, MFP algorithm scans a transaction database only once, it has higher efficiency than FP _growth. We have not found the similar work so far.



II. THE PRINCIPLE OF THE MFP ALGORITHM  A. Related Definition  We give the following definitions first.

Definition 1 Transaction database stores transaction  records. Every transaction record in a transaction database has a sole identifier and all items included in the transaction record are listed in order. Figure I is a simple transaction database named D.

TOOl is the identifier of the first transaction record in D.

Transaction TOOl includes items II , 12, IS, which are listed in the order of item suffixes.

TID List of item ID's TOOl 11, 12, 15 TOO2 12, 14 T003 12, 13 TOO4 11, 12, 14 T005 11, 13 TOO6 12, 13 T007 11, 12 T008 11, 12, 13, 15 TOO9 11, 12, 13  F gure 1. Transaction database      Definition 2 MFP _tree, is composed of a number of tree nodes and a root labeled with "null". Every node has n sub? nodes (n = 0, 1, 2 . . .  ). When n = 0, the node is called leaf node. We use an MFP _tree to present a transaction database.

A tree node is labeled with the name of an item in the transaction database. Except of the root, every node in the tree has two fields. One is Ii.count and the other is Ii.pointer.

The Ii.count is equal to the number of the items, which appear in the nodes, and is displayed in a bracket on the right of the node label. Ii.pointer is a pointer, which points to its mother node.

Definition 3 Combination C is any combination of nodes (the root is not included) on a branch from a leaf to the root.

The C is presented with the labels of the nodes combined.

The name has a number in a bracket on the right. An example of an MFP _tree is shown in Figure 2.

nu11  12(2) 14 (2)  15(1)  Figure2. MFP _tree  a)  14, 15 are leaf nodes in the Figure 2. Because 15.count=l, and there are three nodes I1, 12, 15 on the branch, four compositions are constructed. They are {I5, I2}(1), {I5, Il}(l)' {15, 12, 11 }(l), {12, I1 }(1). There are two nodes 12, 14 on the other branch, and I4.count = 2, so we can get the composition of {14, I2h2).

Definition 4 Table TL is a list of pointers. Every pointer in table TL only points to a leaf node of an MF _tree and every leaf node is pointed only by one pointer.

Definition 5 Set CF is a kind of sets whose element is C.

B. The principle of MFP Algorithm  The mining process of MFP Algorithm can be divided into two steps. One is to construct MFP _tree; the other is to mine MFP tree.

(1) Construction ofMFP _tree The root of an MFP tree labeled with "null" is created  first. Then, the first transaction record is taken out from the transaction database D being mined and inserted into the  MFP_tree in the following way. The first item of the record is taken out. If the root of the tree has a sub-node whose label is the same as the label of item just taken out, we add 1 to the node's count field. Otherwise, we create a new sub? node of the root with the same label as the item. After that, we use the sub-node as a sub-tree's root, take out the next item from the transaction record and insert it into the sub-  tree in the same way. The process repeats till all the items in the transaction record are put into the MFP _tree. In this way, we can insert all the transaction records in D into the  MFP _tree and complete the conversion of the transaction database D into the MFP _tree. In the MFP _tree, one branch from a leaf to the root presents one or more transaction records of D, and stores the association information among the items of a transaction record.

In order to mine an MFP _tree easier, according to Definition 5, we create table TL whose elements are pointers pointing to leaf nodes respectively.

We can convert the transaction database D showed in Figure 1 into the MFP _tree shown in Figure 3. The number in the bracket on the right side of a node label is the node's Ii.count value.

F n L\I2(3' '" LI 11(6) J  ? .. IJ(2) \'" IJ (2) 012 (4) 14 (I)  .. \r'->I \ //?// 4 .. /-\4;(7; ???I?? ) \. r' 5 '" " ,/ 6 .. 15 (I)  Figure 3. The MFP _tree from 0  (2) Mining MFP _tree We take out the first pointer in table TL and get the leaf  pointed to. All of combinations are composed of the nodes except the root on the branch the leaf connects to. We then put labels and values to all the combinations according to Definition 3. After that, we send all combinations into set CF, if there are not the same combination labels in set CF.

Otherwise, we merge the two combinations with the same label by adding together the two count values. After all combinations of the nodes on the branch are sent into set CF, we modifY the nodes on the branch in following way. The leaf node's count value is subtracted from every other node's count value on the branch. Then, if the mother node of the leaf is not the root and does not have other sub-node or sub? nodes, we make the pointer of table TL point to the mother node of the leaf. Otherwise, we delete the pointer in TL.

We can take out all the pointers in table TL and process all the node in the MFP _tree in this way.

On finishing processing the MFP _tree, we delete those combinations in CF, whose count value is less than min_sup given. After that, all the combinations left in set CF are candidate frequent patterns we want. We can create all association rules from the combination in set CF, and use min _ conf given to find strong association rules. An example of mining MFP _tree shown in Figure 3 is given below.

V5-123     We find leaf nodes 15 with the first pointer in table TL, and get the branch node 15, 12, 11. We combine the three node to get the combinations of {15, I2}(l), {15, 11 hI), {15, 12, 11 }(l), {12, II }(I), . Because set CF is empty at this moment, the four combinations enter CF directly. Then we modifY the nodes on the branch, by subtracting the number of the I5.count from the other nodes count on the branch. Because the mother node of 15 is 12 and it has other sub-nodes, we simply delete the pointer in table TL. Now we take out the next pointer in table TL and repeat the above process till there is the last pointer. The last pointer in table TL points to 15, so we get the branch from 15 to the root. The branch is composed of I5, 13, 12, n. We can get all the combinations from the four nodes, and put them into set CF. Then, we modifY the count fields of the four nodes on the branch. At this time, 13 the mother node of 15 does not have any other sub-node, so we let the pointer pointing to 15 to point to B.

After that, in the same way, we process the new branch from the root to 13 being pointed to by the pointer.

At last, we delete those combinations in set CF, whose count is less than min_sup (min_sup = 2 in this example) and obtain set CF as below.

CF={ {I3,Il h4), {I2,Il }(4), {I3,I2 h4), {I5,I2h2), {I5,Il h2), {I4,I2h2?), {I5,I2,Il }(2), {I3,I2,Il }(2)l }

III. MFP ALGORITHM  A. The Algorithm  The poseudcode ofMFP algorithm lists below.

Input: Transaction database D, min_sup output: Candidate frequent set CF method: ( I) Build MFP tree  Create root node; Open D: While (not EO F)  { R = current record: call insert_tree(R, null): move the pointer of D to the next record; }  procedure insert_tree (record, root_nod) { while (record <> ?)  {first = the first item of the record: delete the item from the record:  if (root node has a sub-node labeled with A and the label = first)  A.count = A.count+ I : else  { create node A; A.count=l; A.pointer point to root_nod;}  If (record <> ?) {call insert_tree (record, A) recursively}  } delete the pointer in table TL pointing to another node on the branch.: create a pointer pointing to node A:  (2) mining MFP _tree (tree,TL) { while (TL<>?)  {get the first pointer of TL which point to A; combine all nodes on the branch from A to root and get Cl, C2, ??? , Cm; for (I = I; I <= m; i++)  {Ci.count = a.count; if (Ci E CF)  CF.Ci.count=CF.Ci.count+Ci.count;else; put Ci into CF: }  Subtract A.count from all other nodes' count; if (A is not the root and its mother node does no  have other sub-nodes) { let the pointer in TL point to the mother node of  A:  else delete node A; }  delete the pointer in TL point to A: } delete those combinations in CF whose count  <min_sup:  B. The Result of the trial operation  We used MFP algorithm to mine an experiment transaction database in order to obtain automatically the formulas of synthetic perfume essence. The database stores about 5000 records. The records came from the experiments for synthetic perfume essence and were transferred into transaction data. The test results show that MFP algorithm successfully mine out about one hundred of candidate frequent formulas and some of formulas turned to be very interesting and valuable. Some professional persons who are studying the perfume essences formulas think this is a new way to find formulas of perfume essences and can obtain essence formulas automatically. Of cause, in this process professional persons are still needed to test those formulas in order to get really useful formulas. The tests showed that  MFP algorithm's mining efficiency is very high. It can be inferred easily from the principle of the algorithm that MFP algorithm's efficiency will get even higher, when a transaction database becomes larger and it can be used in similar situation.



IV. CONCLUSION  It is very important to have a data mining algorithm with high efficiency because transaction database usually are very  V5-124     large. Analyzing FP _growth algorithm fully, we design an association rule mining algorithm called MFP. MFP algorithm can complete the mining process through scanning the transaction database only one time. MFP algorithm can be applied to any situation where FP _growth or Apriori algorithm can be used.
