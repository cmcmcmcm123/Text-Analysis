Personality Traits as Moderators of the Relationship between Customer  Satisfaction and Loyalty

ABSTRACT  This study investigates the moderating role of personality traits on the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty. Survey data were collected from shoppers of two supermarkets in Beijing, China. The results show that consumers? characteristic of extraversion is positively related to the level of accrued loyalty, while consumer?s characteristic of neuroticism attenuates the association between customer satisfaction and loyalty. Implications for managers in the retail context are also discussed.

Key words: extraversion, neuroticism, customer satisfaction, loyalty   1. INTRODUCTION1   The antecedent-consequence association between customer satisfaction and loyalty has drawn attentions in the past three decades. Organizations in service industry have invested heavily in efforts to gain customer satisfaction that underpins loyalty, which in turn, lead to the long term profitability of the firms. There is a general belief in industry that customer satisfaction is positively related to loyalty, whereas their association rule may vary across product category and under differentiated market environment [1]. Factors such as personal characteristics [2], variety seeking, innovation, and relationship proneness [3,4], switching cost or barriers to exit [5], prior experience and past behavior [6] have demonstrated in literature their roles as the moderator in the link of customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Explicit consumer characteristics like demographics assume the center of study in previous researches exploring the moderating effects of personal characteristics. However, the implicit parts of personality also matter in evoking consumer needs and demands.

Many articles in the extant body of literature have demonstrated that an individual?s extraversion or neuroticism qualities will affect his or her sense of satisfaction and choice behavior [7-9]. Thus, these traits may also affect his or her judgment on how customer satisfaction is associated with loyalty.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the moderating role of personality in the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty in the retail context. The supermarket sector is characteristized by intensive   Corresponding author: Shuo-Chang Tsai is with the Department of Business Administration, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan (Phone: +886-926-272-572; fax: +886-423-321-157) This project is supported by Grant No. Asia University 98-NSC-14   competition and voltile market situation. Satisfaction as a main driver of excellent customer ralationship allows the strategy formulation and execution of satisfaction management to become the top priority [10]. What makes this study distinct from others is the approach where both the relationship between personality and customer satisfaction/loyalty and which traits greatly influence this association are investigated. The remianing parts of this paper are organized as follows. The next section presents the literaturer review outcome of customer-loyalty links and personality effects just mentioned, also included is the conceptual model proposed in this study. The research design and the method to verify the hypothesises are described in the third section. The fourth section contains the results of hierarchical regression analsis. Finally, we present the discussion on the basis of research findings for managerial implications and draw the conclusion.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW   2.1 Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty  Scholar indicated that consumers in fact demand channel to come up with six service outputs: bulking-braking, spatial convenience, shorter waiting time, product assortment, customer services, and information provision [11]. Among them product quality and service quality account for what entice customers to make contribution to the operational performance of a channel store [12], given the supermarket offers a variety of products and complementary services. Past studies have set perceived product and service quality as predictors of customer satisfaction that has indirect positive effect on loyalty [12].

For the service industry where intensive competition is a way of life, firms compete on how they can enhance customers? satisfaction so as to retain them, in anticipation of securing customer loyalty manifested by repeat purchase. Previous researches already indicated       the significant relevance of customer satisfaction with loyalty, assuming loyal customers will buy more, be less price sensitive, and are willing to act as enthusiastic advocates for their preferable firms [13]. Although empirical evidences of this relationship are mixed [1], it is well recognized that customer satisfaction is positively correlated with loyalty [5]. The higher level of satisfaction consumers reach toward a product or service provider, the more likelihood customers demonstrate their behavioral loyalty [4]. Thus, we assume that:  H1: Product quality has positive influence on customer  loyalty.

H2: Service quality has positive influence on customer  loyalty.

H3: Customer satisfaction has positive influence on  customer loyalty.

2.2 Personality Effects  Personality is a psychographic variable which plays important role in the domain of psychological behavior research. In the fields of marketing and consumer behavior, a large proportion of studies are devoted in the forecasting of product uses or choices taking into account of personality or lifestyle traits [14]. Personality refers to certain persistent qualities in human behavior [15]. According to the Freudian theory and learning theory, the personality traits dominate the individual choice and behavior [14-16]. Personality characteristics of an individual will affect their subjective well-being [8], job satisfaction [17], emotion and customer satisfaction [7, 9].

In this study, we select the extraversion and neuroticism out of the Big-Five Factor Model for their well-established properties, and analyze their influence on customer satisfaction and loyalty. Extraversion is distinguished by venturesomeness, affiliation, positive affectivity, energy, ascendance and ambition, while neuroticism represents distress, nervous tension, depression, guilt, low self-esteem, poor control of impulses and somatic complaints [7]. An individuals? attitude and behavior are characterized by their personality traits. Extraversion characteristics of an individual will positively influence their brand affect and ecological behavior [16, 18]. Extraversion is positively correlated with subjective well-being, whereas neuroticism is negatively correlated with subjective well-being [8]. Personality trait of neuroticism effects negative emotions whereas extraversion effects positive emotions [7, 9]. Thus, we can infer that extraversion is positively related with positive emotion that engenders customer satisfaction, while neuroticism is negatively related with the two constructs. Hence, based on the associations between customer satisfaction and loyalty, we make the hypotheses that:  H4: Extraversion is positively correlated with loyalty.

H5: Neuroticism is negatively correlated with loyalty.

Investigation in how extraversion and neuroticism as moderators of the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty is a less-visited area.

Nevertheless, extraverts are more likely to desire a relational orientation and positive thinking [19]. The relationship orientation, in turn, may be positively related to customer satisfaction and loyalty [20, 21]. In addition, consumers with greater relationship proneness tend to exhibit a stronger relationship between relationship quality and behavioral loyalty [3]. Thus, consumers with extraversion characteristics are apt to develop affinity with certain brand given experiencing satisfaction via acts done by the service provider, whereas consumers with neuroticism characteristics would experience lower levels of attachment when experiencing satisfaction acts done by the service provider [22]. Research in job satisfaction also revealed that extraversion will moderate the relationship between perceived procedural fairness, social rewards, and employee job attitudes [23]. Therefore, we will investigate the moderating effect of extraversion and neuroticism in the context of retail environment, and hypothesize that:  H6: The stronger the customer?s extraversion personality, the stronger influence on the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty.

H7: The stronger the customer?s neuroticism personality, the weaker influence on the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Our proposed conceptual framework is shown as the model in Figure 1. The model predicts positive effect of extroversion and negative effect of neuroticism on loyalty. It is in line with prior research suggesting the main effects of customer satisfaction, perceived product quality and perceived service quality. The interactions between personality traits and customer satisfaction are also shown in the model.

Figure 1 Proposed model in this study   3. METHOD   3.1 Participants  Survey about consumers? feelings, attitudes, and  Loyalty  Product Quality  Customer Satisfaction  Service Quality  Extraversion  Neuroticism      behaviors toward the supermarket store patronized most often is used to test the model. The economics growth in China advances rapidly enough to attract the entry of multinational supermarket retailers such as Carrefour, Wal-Mart, and Metro. They compete against domestic supermarket retail chains like Wumart and Jingkelong in the urban regions. Shoppers of Carrefour and Wumart were selected for interview. Data was collected by intercept method in the vicinity of these two stores in Beijing. A marketing research agency was entrusted to conduct the survey. Those who are below 18 years old were not allowed to participate in the survey. The structure of the questionnaire includes the objective of the survey, specific indicators of product quality, service quality, customer satisfaction and loyalty, personality trait and demographics of the respondents. In November 2009, 400 consumers in total have been engaged in the survey, with 200 respondents for each store respectively.

We did away with 29 pieces of Carrefour and 28 pieces of Wumart response questionnaire due to their incompleteness or inconsistency. Thus, the final effective sample size was 343 with a response rate of 85.8%.

3.2 Measurement  All constructs were measured by incumbent and tested scales extracted from the literature. The scales of product quality, service quality, customer satisfaction and loyalty were adopted from the scales measuring customer satisfaction in the retail environment [10, 13, 24]. Six statements were taken from Costa and McCrae [25] measuring the personality traits of extraversion and neuroticism. All question items were evaluated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from ?strongly disagree? to ?strongly degree?.

3.3 Demographics  The demographics for each sample are presented in Table 1. On the total sample statistics, female consumers answered most of the survey instruments, accounting for 68.5% of the respondents. The sample was approximately equally distributed across age, and a large portion of the samples were middle class citizens with the income of less than 4,000 RMB/month and without college graduates. About 50% of correspondents in the sample frame bought at these supermarkets 4 to 6 times a month. The sample was nearly consistent across the two supermarkets. However, on the average, shoppers of Wumart stores are senior to and less educated than those of Carrefour stores.

3.4 Factor Analysis  Factor analysis was conducted on the two samples combined. Consistent with the underlying theory, the number of factors to be retained was specified to six factors and a varimax method was performed since they are believed to be correlated. Based on the exploratory factor analysis, two items from product quality, two  items from service quality, one item from customer satisfaction, and one item from loyalty were dropped due to poor factor loadings or cross loadings. The six factors explained 63.1% of the variance and were exhibited in Table 2, where LO=loyalty, CS=customer satisfaction, SQ=service quality, PQ=product quality, EX=extraversion, and NE=neuroticism. Value of Cronbach?s alpha for each construct was also calculated in Table 2. The value of coefficient for extraversion, product quality, and neuroticism did not exceed the general accepted criterion of 0.7. Taking into account that the value of coefficient is affected by the sample size and number of items, we used the means of each construct in the following analysis to test the proposed model.

3.5. Descriptive Statistics  The mean scores of the constructs were calculated as shown in Table 3. The mean scores on a 5-point scale are about 4 for loyalty, customer satisfaction, product quality, and service quality, suggesting moderately positive evaluation of the supermarket patronized most often. The average ratings of personality traits are 4.03 for extraversion and 2.55 for neuroticism, implying the respondents feature distinctive outgoing personality.

Table 3 also shows the correlations among the constructs.

As having been hypothesized, customer satisfaction, product quality, service quality, and extraversion are positively correlated with loyalty. The negative relationship between neuroticism and loyalty, however, is not that significant. Customer satisfaction, product quality, and service quality are positively correlated, while extraversion and neuroticism are negatively correlated, as previous literature so suggested.

4. EMPIRICAL RESULTS   Hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the hypothesis. In order to reduce multicollinearity between the main effect variables and their interaction terms, all main effect variables were mean centered prior to the creation of interaction terms [26].The data for the two supermarkets were analyzed combined together. A variable (STORE) was created to reflect the two supermarkets with Wumart stores as reference group in this study. Three regression models were established. The first one included the direct effects of customer satisfaction, service quality and product quality. The difference of loyalty between Carrefour and Wumart was also illustrated in this model. The second model added the main effects of extraversion and neuroticism to analyze the role of these two variables in the formation of consumer loyalty. Finally, the model explored the interaction effects of personality traits and customer satisfaction. The three models were evaluated as table 4.

Model 1 has shown, consistent with previous studies, that customer satisfaction and service quality has significant positive impact on loyalty. H1 and H3 are supported. The positive effect of product quality,  however, is not proved in this study. A reasonable and plausible explaination is that products there are mainly low involvement goods for daily use, consumers rather pay more attention to the service in the retail environment, especially for the formation of purchase behavior or repurchase behavior. What is also salient lies in the inference that customer satisfaction may play a mediating role in the relationship between product quality and loyalty, since the correlation between the two variables is significantly positive as shown in Table 3.

Hence, the direct effect of product quality on loyalty is not significant in this study, H3 is not supported.

Consumers dispaly a higher level of loyalty for Wumart stores than that for Carefour stores as the variable of STORE has significant negative impact on the dependent variable. A possible reason is that the age distribution of consumers are different between the two supermarkets.

As previously stated, Wumart are largely sponsored by senior consumers group who have limited information-processing capabilities and tend to stick to a store brand than the yonger group does [4] .

We added the main effects of extraversion and neuroticism in Model 2, and the R-squared value increased significantly. The coefficients of the two variables demonstrated that the main effect of extraversion is in place as it has significant positive impact on loyalty, Hypothesis 4 is supported. As opposed to hypothesis 5, neuroticism does not significantly affect customer loyalty.

Consistent with Hypothesis 7, the moderating effect of neuroticism is proved, while Hypothesis 6 about moderating effect of extraversion is not supported. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the effect of interactions graphically. Consumers of high extraversion inclination are readily loyal to the store brand than consumers with low extraversion aptitude.

The relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty are weaker for consumers with high neuroticism inclination, and vice versa. The personality trait of neuroticism displays a significant moderating effect on the customer satisfaction-loyalty link. The interaction      effect of extraversion, and the main effect of neuroticism on loyalty, however, are not significant in this study.

CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS   Previous research has largely neglected the issue of moderating effects of implicit factors, e.g. personality traits, on the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty. Against this background, the moderating impacts of extraversion and neuroticism traits on the satisfaction-loyalty link are investigated in this study.

The results reveal that extraversion aptitude has significant positive effect on customer loyalty, whereas neuroticism inclination is detrimental to the association between customer satisfaction and loyalty. The results also shed light on the importance of customer satisfaction and service quality as the literature has already suggested. Re-formulating and executing a refined strategy that improve service quality and enhance  customer satisfaction will be the top priority for management in the retail context.

The outcome of this research work makes a significant contribution to fill the gap in the literature of customer satisfaction and loyalty. It does so by providing a deep insight at the role of personality traits in the formation of loyalty. The classical CRM strategy to improve loyalty through increasing satisfaction is not always applicable to every customer un-distinguishably; rather it depends on the personality characteristics of consumer. Service marketing practitioners can also benefit from this research in discovering the origin and evolution of customer loyalty to formulate and execute appropriate marketing strategies. This study not only confirms the past findings in the extant body of literature that service quality and customer satisfaction play a crucial role in loyalty, but also discloses the implication of their dependence on consumers? personality characteristic. It is important for companies to discriminate customer groups who rely on satisfaction as the mediating driver to underpin loyalty from groups who are less sensitive to the satisfaction-loyalty conjugation [5]. This research outcome indicates that an across-the-board CRM strategies to increase customer satisfaction not necessarily yields higher level of loyalty that is generally believed to be the antecedent of company profitability.

Consumers with neuroticism trait subject to the tendency of store switching, building a long term intimate relations with them could be a target too far to reach.

This research comes with some limitations and subsequent opportunities for further study. First, the main effect of neuroticism and the moderating effect of extraversion didn?t manifest themselves in this study.

The purchase decision in a grocery supermarket context involves complicated factors besides product and service quality. Other considerations such as pricing, promotion, discounting, food safety, country of origin, the use of private brand, and etc. inevitably interfere with the decision making process of customers in terms of repeat purchase. Applying the model to other contexts like specific product category or pure service industry can be the alternative to see the role of personality traits in the customer satisfaction-loyalty link. Second, we have focused on the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty. It would be desirable to analyze the role of personality traits in the formation process of customer satisfaction, and loyalty-profitability associations, in that way, we can from a broader perspective to gain a deeper insight into the impact of personality characteristics on consumption behavior Finally, reliability and validity of some constructs are not so satisfactory owing to the exploratory nature of this study. Further investigations are needed in the future to explore the functions of personality in consumer choice and behavior.
