I.  INTRODUCTION In large relational database, it is difficult and  unnecessary to find the relationship among the attributes at the primary level, because there are lots of distinct values for numerical attribute. People usually concern about the association rules at high concept level, such as the relationship of education level and incoming[3]. However, in practice the partition of the concept is often designated by people, the result is identical at any occasion. It can not reflect people?s different view at the same thing. The cloud is a method of describing uncertain problem. It comprehensively considers randomness and fuzziness, can be used interchangeably to bridge the gap between quantitative and qualitative. So if we use the cloud  model to dynamically divided attribute value , the shortcoming that the concept was partitioned by experience will be overcome.

At present, the cloud theory has been widely applied in many fields, such as the partition of fuzzy region in image processing, comprehensive evaluation of shooting athletes, association rules and prediction, etc[2][3][4].

Thus, the cloud model is presented to mine association rules in the paper. First of all, we use a set of 1-D cloud model to dynamically divide every attribute value.

Secondly, the credit card database are further scanned by the improved Apriori Algorithm, to find out all cloud association rules which have support and confidence greater than user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence respectively. Finally, the customers? consuming awareness and tendency are summarized based on the analysis of the cloud association rules, to implement personalized marketing and provide different services for the credit card customers.



II. CLOUD MODEL The Cloud is brought forward by Prof. De-yi Li. It is  the uncertain switch model between the qualitative concept and its expression of number with uncertainty and randomness [7]. The cloud is composed of many of cloud drops. A drop is one-time value of qualitative concept. The total cloud reflects the radical character of fuzzy concept.

U(the universe of discourse) is defined as  U={u} .

T is the language value related to U. The degree of pertain which is called as CT(u), is the degree that u belongs to U. The number feature of cloud is signified with the expected value, entropy and hyper entropy. So the cloud model is recorded as A(Ex,En,He). The expected value Ex is the center value of the concept. The entropy En is defined by the bandwidth of the MEC(mathematical expected curve) of the normal cloud showing how many elements in the universe of discourse could be accepted.

The MEC of the normal cloud is defined by the following formula:     )(exp)(  n  x A E  EuuMEC ??=                        (1)  The entropy He is the uncertain degree of cloud drop.

If the number characteristics Ex, En and He of the cloud are given, the following algorithm can be used to produce normal cloud[3].

?1?The normal random number xi  is calculated by the following formula:  ),( nxi EEGx =                                  (2) ?2?Then the normal random number  ' in  E  is created with the entropy En and the standard deviation He  by the following formula:  ),( ' HeEGE nn i =                             (3)  ?3??xi??i?is viewed as cloud drop, ?i is calculated by the following formula:  in  xi i  E Ex 2'   )(exp ??=?                                  (4)  The above algorithm can be implemented in both hardware and software, which is named as cloud generator[8].Figure1 shows a 1-D forward cloud generator. Correspondingly, given six digital characteristics Ex,Enx,Hex,Ey,Eny and Hey, to represent a two-dimensional linguistic atom, the 2-D cloud generator could produce any number of drops of clouds. Figure2 shows a 2-D forward cloud generator.

III. ASSOCIATION RULES AND CLOUD ASSOCIATION RULES  A. The concept of association rule Let I={i1,i2,?,im} be a set of n binary attributes called  items. Let D be a set of transactions called the database.

Each transaction T in D has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I. A rule is defined as an implication of the form X?Y, where X?I, Y?I and X?Y=?. The sets of items X and Y are called antecedent (left-hand-side or LHS) and consequent (right-hand-side or RHS) of the rule respectively[10].

1) support and confidence The support of the rule X?Y is defined as the  proportion of transactions in the database D that contain X ? Y .

)()( YXPYXSUPP ?=?                            (5)  The confidence of the rule X?Y  is defined as the proportion of transactions in the database D that contain X also contain Y.

)|( )(  )()( XYP XSUPP  YXSUPPYXconf =?=?                (6)  We usually use the constraints which is minimum thresholds on support and confidence to select interesting rules from the set of all possible rules.

2) frequent  itemset A set of item is called as itemset?k-itemset denotes  an itemset including k items. An itemset with a support? the minimum support threshold is called a frequent itemset.

Lk  denotes a set of  frequent k-itemset.

Given a database of D, the problem of mining association rules is to generate all association rules that  have support and confidence greater than user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence respectively.

To achieve this, association rule generation is a two-step process. First, minimum support is applied to find all frequent itemsets in a database. In the second step, these frequent itemsets and the minimum confidence constraint are used to form rules.

B. Cloud Association Rules Cloud association rule[3] is an association rule which  is generated based on the division of the attribute domain by using cloud model.

Let D={t1, t2,?,tn} be a database and I={i1,i2,?,im} denote the set of attributes where tj indicates the jth record of T, and tj[ik] is the value of its attribute ik.

We assume that the definition domain, ikF ,of the attribute ik, can be divided into many concepts by cloud model. And hence we have },...,,{  21 l ikikikik fffF = ,  j ik  f  denote  the jth category in kiF . The symbols j  ik Ex ,  j ik  En and j  ik He  represent the digital characteristic of the concept j  ik f .

Let X and Y be the subset of I, X and Y denote as }...,,{ and },...,,{ ,2121 qp yyyYxxxX ==  with ?=?YX .

Supposing that ixf (i=1,2,?,p) and iyf (j=1,2,?,q) be the concept of the attribute xi and yi  in the universe of discouse, the set A is the form of },...,,{ 21 xpxx fffA = .Similarly the set B is the form of },...,,{ 21 yqyy fffB =  .Let BACYXZ ?=?= , , and then the cloud association rules we discussed are following the form that if X?A then Y?B.



IV. APRIORI ALGORITHM BASED ON CLOUD MODEL The Apriori algorithm[6] proposed by R. Agrawal in  1994 is one of the most effective data mining algorithms for mining frequent itemset in transactional database. This algorithm repeats a level-wise method to mining frequent itemsets. The essential idea is to iteratively generate the frequent (k+1)-itemsets from the set of frequent k-itemsets (for k?1). First of all, the frequent 1-itemsets are picked out, denoted as L1. Secondly generate the set of candidate itemsets Ck2 with 2 items from L1, and then the frequent 2- itemsets L2 are generated by checking candidate itemsets.

Repeat this process until no new frequent k -itemsets can be found.

For a given database D? the mining of the cloud association rules are to find out the fuzzy association rules , which have support and confidence greater than user- specified minimum support and minimum confidence respectively by the improved Apriori algorithm, after dividing the definition domain of attributes in the database D by the cloud model. The steps of Apriori algorithm[2] can be described as the following: Input? the transaction database D?minimum support threshold min_sup.

Output?all of frequent itemset in  D.

L1=find_frequent_1-itemsets(D)? for(k=2?Lk-1 ??  ?k++){ Ck =apriori_gen(Lk-1?min_sup)?

V. CLOUD ASSOCIATION RULES APPLYING IN CREDIT CARD MARKETING  In order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the normal cloud in mining association rules, we conducted experiment by using a credit card database. And We selected 237 credit card customers from the database.

The analyzing data is described in the Table I.

Since the attributes are numerical and categorical in the Table I, it is impossible to discover strong association rules with the Apriori algorithm at the primary level directly.

The attributes, not only numerical attributes but also the nominal and categorical attributes, can be generalized to multiple concept levels with the cloud model. So it is preferable to generalize the attributes first and then mine rules with the generalized data.

For instance, the attribute Age is numerical type in the Table I, should be generalized by using 1-D forward and backward generator. Therefore the attribute Age can be partitioned into five ranges: A1[18-22], A2[23-34], A3[35- 40], A4[41-60],A5[60 and above]. Similarly, according to our country present situation, the incoming will also be divided into four scopes in the same way :W1[?3000 above], W2[ ? 2000- ? 3000],W3[ ? 1000- ? 2000], W4[?1000 below].

In addition, the attribute of career is categorical, which should to be generalized according to the actual situation.

Hence, its domain can be classified into seven types ,denoted as following: O1={ Public Servant}, O2={Teacher, Doctor}, O3={Lawyer,Finance Practitioner}, O4={Military, Journalist},O5={Enterpriser, Clerk}, O6={Student},O7={Others}. The attribute of education is the same as career. So it can be classified into five types in the same way: X1={Master and above}, X2={Bachelor}, X3={College}, X4={ Technical School, High School},  X5={Others}. Parts of transformed data are shown in the Table II.

We assign minimum support threshold and the minimum confidence threshold 10% and 80% respectively.

Five association rules are generated with the improved Apriori algorithm based on the normal cloud model. The rules can be described in the Table III.

The first rule indicates that the expenditure pattern of consumers is E5F1 if education is ?post-graduate degree or above?. The confidence of this rule is 87.4% and the support is 23.2%.

And the 5th rule shows if education is ?post-graduate degree or above?, occupation is ?teacher or doctor?, and incoming exceeds 3000, then the probability that expenditure pattern of consumers is  E5F1  is  80.5%. The support of this rule is 12.8%.

Based on the analysis of the above association rules, we can draw a conclusion that the bank should pay more attention to the customers whose expenditure pattern is E5F1. This kind of customers is usually well-educated, and their work and incoming are relatively stable. According to their consumption demand, mainly including housing, automobile, education and so on, the products supplied for them should be primarily consisted of the personal credit class. And the bank should provide fast, convenient service for them in order to increase customer satisfaction.



VI. CONCLUSION In the paper, we firstly use the cloud model for data  preprocessing in mining association rules, then adopt the improved Apriori Algorithm to mine association rules in a large credit card transaction database at high concept level.

The result of experiment shows that this approach, combining the cloud model based on generalization method with Apriori algorithm, is superior to the conventional method in holding uncertainties. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the cloud association rules, we can find the relation of customer?s consumption behavior and their attributes, such as education, incoming, age, occupation and summarize the different types of customers? consuming awareness and tendency in order to carry on the personalized marketing and provide the differentiated service for the credit card customers.
