I.  INTRODUCTION In recent years, collaborative filtering has attracted a  considerable amount of research attention resulting in the proposal of a large variety of CF approaches [4-10]. Recently, a fatal issue in collaborative filtering, general neighborhood problem, is identified in our previous work [11]. In fact, in the almost cases, the problem often could result into wrong recommendation. In order to avoid the problem, Collaborative Filtering based on Community (CFC) is presented. Although CFC make essential improvement for CF, unfortunately, it suffers from severer sparsity, more techniques are used to enhance it. Pre-filling is widely used, including vertical pre- filling (VPF for short) and horizontal pre-filling (HPF for short). Pre-filling based on user-community pair (PUC) is suggested to improve them by combing VPF and HPF. But, it still could suffer from sparsity which results into disability to pre-filling when all items from a certain category (community) are null for active user. So, pre-filling based on association rule is presented to improve when PUC suffer from sparsity.

Based on a series of above methods, a complete and hierarchical Collaborative Filtering Method System (CFMS) is build. CFMS extend simple collaborative filtering, adapting to various different situations. Experiments are made to empirically valuate and compare various methods of CFMS.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a review on related literature. In section 3, collaborative filtering based on community is presented. In section 4, pre-filling based on user-community pair (PUC) is proposed for limitation of CFC. In section 5, pre-filling based on community association (PCA), and CFC based on PCA (CAN) is presented to overcoming limitation of PUC. In section 6, a complete and hierarchical collaborative filtering methods system is build, including tree structure and flowing chart of methods. Finally, experimental evaluation is empirically made. Some concluding remarks and directions for future research are provided.



II. RELATED WORK Tapestry is one of the earliest implementations of  collaborative filtering-based recommender systems. The GroupLens research system provides a pseudonymous collaborative filtering solution for Usenet news and movies [1, 2]. The method of selecting nearest-neighbors is an important issue for the nearest-neighbor CF approach. Sparsity problem in CF recommender system has been addressed in [2, 3, 6].

The problems associated with high dimensionality in recommender systems have been discussed and application of dimensionality reduction techniques to address these issues has been investigated in [6].

In [12] it is found that highly correlated neighbors can be exceptionally more valuable to each other in the prediction process than low correlated neighbors. Herlocker et al. [13] have systematically studied various design issues for the nearest-neighbor CF approach. In [14], Wang et al. proposed a generative probabilistic framework to exploit more of the data available in the user-item matrix by fusing all ratings with a predictive value for a recommendation to be made. Xue et al.

[15] proposed a framework for collaborative filtering which combines the strengths of memory-based approaches and model-based approaches by introducing a smoothing-based method, and solved the data sparsity problem by predicting all the missing data in a user-item matrix. In [3], Zhang & Pu present a recursive prediction algorithm, which allows those nearest-neighbor users to join the prediction process even if they have not rated the given item.

___________________________________     Lin et al. (2002) proposed an Adaptive-Support Association Rule Mining (ASARM) algorithm for collaborative filtering [10]. ASARM mines rules for one target item at a time, and automatically adjusts the minimum support value to mine a user-specified number of rules. The MAR approach proposed in Kim and Kim (2003) applied association rules between categories in multiple-level product taxonomies to address data sparseness [16].

Although a lot of works contribute to collaborative filtering, to my best knowing, there is no previous work showing that classical collaborative filtering is not suit to multi-interests recommendation or multi-community recommendation due to general neighborhood problem. We present collaborative filtering based on community in previous work. Unfortunately, CFC suffers from severer sparsity. In this paper, after various improvements are made for CFC, based on the series of methods, a complete and hierarchical collaborative filtering method system is build.



III. CF BASED ON COMMUNITY  A. General Neighborhood Problem in CF Collaborative filtering (CF) rely on the fact that each  person belongs to a larger group of similar behaving individuals (Neighborhood). Neighborhood is determined the user?s General Similarity which is based on all co-rated items.

The neighborhood is called as General Neighborhood. They share general similar interest in various interest domains with active user. However, they could not share the most similar interest in a certain special interest field (community) with active user. So, to predict preference of user for a target item, general neighborhood should not be used to produce recommendation since they do not share the similar interest in target item. But traditional collaborative filtering does so. We call the problem as general neighborhood problem.

B. CF Based on Community The ?community? has two meanings. One means category  of items, where a community is a category of items whose have similar content characteristics and attributes. Another means group of users whose share common interest in a certain special field or have similar preference for a category of items. The former is called as Item Community while the latter is called as User Community. In this paper, ?community? means Item Community.

General neighborhood is based on co-ratings for all communities. If neighborhood is determined based on co- ratings for a special item community, to which the target item belongs, the general neighborhood could be avoid. We call neighborhood determined by co-ratings of users for a special community as Community Neighborhood, as shown in Figure 1. In order to overcome general neighborhood in CF, community neighborhood should be used to generate recommendation. Collaborative filtering based community (CFC) is described as in Figure 2. It is easy to find that CFC suffers from heavier sparsity. Effective method must be employed to enhance the CFC by overcoming sparsity.

Items with Top_N max { PredictedRatingaj }  __________________________________________________ Figure 2. CFC Algorithm

IV. PRE-FILLING BASED ON USER-COMMUNITY FOR IMPROVING CFC  In order to overcome the sparsity, the pre-filling method is employed to pre-fill null rating before producing community neighborhood. The method is widely used to deal with sparsity issue in many fields. In this section, two pre-filling methods, vertical pre-filling (VPF) and horizontal pre-filling (HPF) respectively, are first analyzed. Based on them, pre-filling based on user-community pair is proposed.

A. Vertical and Horizontal Pre-filling The vertical pre-filling (VPF for short) method is done by  averaging the ratings of all users for a fixed item vertically. By the method, missing rating is pre-filled with average value of ratings of all users for corresponding item. The horizontal pre- filling (HPF for short) method is done by averaging the ratings of a fixed user for all items horizontally. That is to say, null rating is pre-filled with average value of ratings of corresponding user for all other items. The two method have their limitations.

B. Pre-filling based on User-Community Pair (PUC) In order to overcome the limitations of HPF and VPF, pre-  filling based on user-community pair (PUC) is proposed. For PUC, it is supposed that a user has similar interest in items from same item community and missing rating could be pre- filled with average rating of current user for items from same community with filled item. Detail PUC method is described as Figure 3.

General Neighborhood  Active User  Community Neighborhood  Community Neighborhood    ____________________________________________________ 1 Community set C={C1,C2,..,CK}? GeneratingCommunity  (Item_set), K is number of communities 2 for each item Ij  do 3    C(j)?TransferingItemToCommunity(Ij); 5 for each user Ui  do 6    { for each item Ij  do 7         if Rij?null  then {Sum iC(j) ? Sum iC(j)+RiC(j);  Count  iC(j)++;} 8      for each community Ck  do 9         CRik ? Sumik / Count ik; 10    } 11 for each user Ui  do 12 for each item Ij  do 13    {if Rij=null and CR iC(j)?null  then PFVij? CR iC(j);}  ____________________________________________________ Figure3. PUC Method  For example, in Table 1, it is supposed that we need to pre-fill R33 for CFC algorithm in order to overcome sparsity. If both VPF method and HPF method are exploited to pre-fill R33, pre-filled value are respectively 2 and 3. If PFC method is exploited to done, then pre-filled value will be (3+4+1+5)/4=3.25 by averaging R31, R35, R37 and R39 because item I1, I3, I5, I7 and I9 are from same item community, English community and R31, R33,R35, R37 and R39 are preference value of user U3 for same community items. It is reasonable that R31, R33, R35, R37 and R39 are close.

It is obvious that PUC is better than simple VPF and HPF since ratings used to pre-fill are more related to pre-filled rating. It only focuses ratings of a user on the items from same community. But it could often happens that ratings of a user on all items from a certain community are missing, which make PUC method invalid. For example, in Table 1, R22 cannot be pre-filled by PUC because ratings of user U2 for item I4, I6, and I8 from Football community are missing. In this case, in next section, CAN method is suggested.

Table 1. A sample on pre-filling based on community  User /Item  I1 (E)  I2 (F)  I3 (E)  I4 (F)  I5 (E)  I6 (F)  I7 (E)  I8 (F)  I9 (E)  I10 (E)  U1 3   1 4    5 U2 3  3  3  2  5 4 U3 3 2 ?  4  1  5 U4   1 5   4 U5 1 4  5 2   4 2 2 U6     1 U7 3 1 2 5 5  4  2 1  In the above, three pre-filling methods are proposed to improve CFC by overcoming its severe sparsity. In practice, CFC is executed after pre-filling method is performed to weaken the sparsity. So, each pre-filling method could be corresponding to a CFC recommendation method.

Recommendation methods corresponding to three pre-filling methods, VPF, HPF and PUC respectively, are called as CFC- VPF, CFC- HPF and CFC-PUC.



V. CF BASED ON COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION AND COMMUNITY NEIGHBORHOOD (CAN)  For CAN, association degree between different communities is firstly analyzed. It is supposed that although interests of users in different community items are different, some communities may be associated. The hypothesis shows that interests of user in a community could still give us some information on his interests in other community, such as like association of beer with diaper. Helping from the view, we can pre-fill the rating though association of current community to other communities and ratings of user for items from other community. As shown in Fig.4, if we want to pre-fill R22, and ratings of user U2 for other items from community C1whihc I2 belong to are null, then simple PFC method cannot be exploited to pre-fill R22. For this case, if we find that community C1 is associated to community C2, then rating of user U2 for item I2 can be pre-filled though ratings of U2 for items from community C2. Apart from ratings of U2 for items from community C2, association degree between community C1 and community C2 should be considered when pre-filling.

In order to mining association rule among different communities, ratings of users for all community items will be used. Since rating is not binary, sharp boundary problem will happen when traditional association rule mining method is exploited and much preference information will be lost when rating data is directly transferred into binary data. In order to employ association rule method for binary data, but litter preference information is lost, fuzzy association rule method is often exploited [19, 20]. In order to find association rule between communities based on rating matrix, Fuzzy association rule mining (FAR) is employed. The CAN algorithm is described as Figure 5.

VI. COMPLETE COLLABORATIVE FILTERING METHOD SYSTEM  Based on above series of methods, we can build a complete collaborative filtering method system which contains traditional Collaborative Filtering (CF), Collaborative Filtering based on Community (CFC), CFC base on VPF    (CFC-VPF), CFC base on HPF (CFC-HPF), CFC base on PUC (CFC-PUC), Collaborative Filtering based on Community Association and Community Neighborhood (CAN for short), as shown in Figure 6.

Items with Top_N max { PredictedRatingaj }  ____________________________________________________ Figure 5. CAN algorithm   Figure 6. Collaborative Filtering Method Tree  Traditional CF is most simple recommendation algorithm which only adapt to situation where all recommended items belong to alone interest title or domain. If the condition can not be satisfied, CFC algorithm is considered. But only when rating is enough dense, community neighborhood of every user in each community can be determined. Otherwise, CFC based on pre-filling is used. Although there are many pre- filling method, generally, PUC is suggested to be exploited.

But if there is no enough data, VPF and HPV are alternative.

In order to use CFC-PUC, rating data should be enough dense so rating of each user-community can be computed, otherwise, CAN should be performed. The flow chart of various methods is shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7.  Collaborative Filtering Method Flowing Chart  In the following, various methods are evaluated through experiments.



VII. EXPERIMENT EVALUATION  A. Dataset Datasets employed in our experiment are from EachMovie  collaborative filtering service. The EachMovie service was part of a research project at the Systems Research Center of Digital Equipment Corporation. The service was available for a period of 18 months and was shut down in September 1997.

During that time the database grew to a fairly large size, containing ratings from 72,916 users on 1,628 movies. User ratings were recorded on a numeric six-point scale (0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0). The data set is publicly available and can be obtained from Digital Equipment Corporation [20].

Although the data from 72,916 users is available, we restrict the analysis to the 450 users in the database. These 450 users provided ratings for 300 different movies. In order to test the performance of various algorithms under different conditions (Dense or Sparse), datasets used in our experiment are grouped into group A and group B. Dataset in group A is denseness dataset in which users have more ratings, and dataset in group B is sparse dataset in which user have little ratings. Datasets in group A are named according to its number of users. Altogether, five datasets is used in our experiment, respectively as A50, A150, A250, A350, A450 in which users respectively are the top 50, 150, 250, 350, 450 users that have the most ratings. Datasets in group B consist of ratings of top 50 150 250 350 450 user by userID for top 250 movies. They are dataset B50 B150 B250 B350  B450. Dataset in group B have heavy sparsity comparing with datasets in group A.

Experiment Setup In each experiment, we varied user correlation threshold  (UCT) from 0 to 0.9 with step 0.1 and also varied UCT. So, 10 experiments are made for each datasets, in where, the best result is used to analyze in the following. For each experiment, Top-N recommendation tactics is exploited, and number of recommended movie is fixed as 30 for comparing the performance of various algorithms.

In the algorithm CAN, movie communities in dataset Eachmovie are determined according to the type of movie provided by dataset. So, there are ten movie communities in our experiment, respectively Action, Animation, Art_Foreign, Classic, Comedy, Drama, Family, Horror, Romance, and Thriller.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between ratings and predictions is a widely used metric. It is exploited in our experiment.

Comparing of Performance under sparse dataset  C. Experiment Result In this section, several findings though experiment are  given. Detail experiment result is shown in Figure 8 and 9.

First, it is shown in Figure 8 and 9 that all five methods based on community, CAN, CFC-PUC, CFC-VPF, CFC-HPV and CFC respectively, generally achieve better performance than CF. It is explained that there exist general neighborhood problem in traditional collaborative filtering and that community neighborhood is effective to overcome the general neighborhood in CF.  It is noticed that CFC has no advantage over CF, especially under sparsity. As shown in Figure 9, CFC show worse performance than CF. It is explained that CFC suffers from severer sparsity than CF. It tells us that simply considering community in collaborative filtering is not always good strategy.

Secondly, as shown in Figure 8 and 9, generally, four CFC methods based on pre-filling, CAN, CFC-PUC, CFC-VPF and CFC-HPV respectively, have advantage over CFC, especially under sparsity situation. By comparing Figure 8 with Figure 9, advantage of CAN, CFC-PUC, CFC-VPF and CFC-HPV over CFC is more obvious under sparse data (Figure 9) than under dense data (Figure 8). It is explained that CFC could suffer from severe sparsity, and pre-filling based on community is help for overcoming the sparsity.

Thirdly, it is noticed that CFC-PUC generally has better performance than CFC-VPF and CFC-HPV.  It is shown that pre-filling based on user-community is better selecting.

Finally, it also is shown in Figure 8 and 9 that CAN generally achieve better performance than CFC-PUC. It is explained that it is not enough to pre-fill simply based on user- community because it is possible that certain user-community could be null, and pre-filling could not succeed. In fact, it is discovered that CAN has more obvious advantage over CFC- PUC under sparse data than under dense data.



VIII. CONCLUSION Recommender systems are a powerful new technology for  extracting additional value for a business from its user databases. Collaborative filtering is the most important    method widely used in recommender systems. In this paper, starting from general neighborhood problem, various methods are proposed and a complete collaborative filtering method system is build. Also, various methods are compared empirically each other. Although experiments elementally support our ideas, it is still need more experiments to verify them with more dataset in the future. More research need to be made to enhance CFC by other methods, such as ontology.
