An Improved Design Approach in Spatial Databases

Abstract- Recently Negative Association Rule Mining (NARM) has become a focus in the field of spatial data mining. Negative  association rules are useful in data analysis to identify objects  that conflict with each other or that complement each other.

Much effort has been devoted for developing algorithms for  efficiently discovering relation between objects in space. All the  traditional association rule mining algorithms were developed to  find positive associations between objects. By positive correlation  we refer to associations between frequently occurring objects in  space such as a city is always located near a river and so on.

Recently the problem of identifying negative associations (or  ?dissociations?) that is absence of objects has been explored and  considered relevant. This paper presents an improved design  approach for mining both positive and negative association rules  in spatial databases. This approach extends traditional  association rules to include negative association rules using a  minimum support count. Experimental results show that this  approach is efficient on simple and sparse datasets when  minimum support is high to some degree, and it overcomes some  limitations of the previous mining methods. The proposed form  will extend related applications of negative association rules to a  greater extent.

I. INTRODUCTION  Database research in the last decade has focused on  developing support for so-called non-standard applications.

One important area is the representation of spatial  information, needed, for example, in Geographic Information  Systems. Improved geographic data should lead to better  conclusions and better decisions. In particular, Association  Rule Mining (ARM) is used to represent the discovered spatial  relationships and infer additional information based on already  discovered relationships. Spatial dataset?s integration has been  widely investigated but unfortunately there exists no  framework to define this process.  It is more complex when  the data has spatial attribute than when it has common  attribute data.

A. Positive Association Rule  Association rule mining, as an important problem in data  mining, was originally proposed in [1]. It is intended to  discover implicit and interesting associations among data  items in a dataset.

Let I = {I1,I2...In} be a set of n distinct objects. Let  T={T1,T2,?Tn} be a set of transactions, where each  transaction T is a set of objects. Let A be a set of objects in I.

Objects of length k are referred to as k-object sets. A  transaction T is said to contain A if A?T. An association rule  is an implication of the form A?B, where A?I, B?I, and  A?B=?. The rule A? B has a support (denoted as supp) in T  if s% of the transactions in T contains A?B.

supp (A?B) =supp (A?B)=P(A?B).                         (1)  The rule A ? B has a measure of its strength called  confidence (denoted as conf) c if c% of transactions in T that  contain A also contain B.

conf (A? B) = P (B|A)=supp(A?B)/supp(A).             (2)   B. Negative Association Rule  The negation of an object set A is indicated by ?A, which  means the absence of the object set A. We call a rule of the  form A?B a positive association rule, and rules of the other  forms (A??B, ?A?B and ?A??B) negative association  rules. The support is given by the following formulas:  supp (?A)=1-supp(A)          (3)  supp (A??B)=supp(A)-supp(A?B)        (4)  supp (?A?B)=supp(B)-supp(A?B)        (5)  supp (?A??B)=1-supp(A)-supp(B)+supp(A?B)       (6)   The confidence is given by the following formulas:  conf(A??B)= )(sup  )(sup)(sup  Ap  BApAp ??          (7)  conf (?A?B) = )(sup1  )(sup)(sup  Ap  BApAp  ?  ??  (8)  conf(?A??B) = )(sup1  )(sup)(sup)(sup1  Ap  BApBpAp  ?  ?+??      (9)  Our paper shows that both positive and negative association  rules can be discovered efficiently from spatial database using  the improved approach.



II. RELATED WORK DONE  The research and application of data mining technology are a  hot spot in database and artificial intelligence in recent years  as Association Rules Mining introduced by R. Agrawal [4] is  an important research topic among the various data mining     problems. Association rules have been extensively studied in  the literature for their usefulness in many application domains  such as market basket analysis, recommender systems,  diagnosis decisions support, telecommunication, intrusion  detection, and etc. All the traditional association rule mining  algorithms were developed to find positive associations  between item sets. Several algorithms have been developed to  cope with the popular and computationally expensive task of  association rule mining [5], AIS [2], DHP [3], and Partition  [4]. With the increasing use and development of data mining  techniques and tools, much work has recently focused on  finding negative patterns, which can provide valuable  information. However, mining negative association rules is a  difficult task, due to the fact that there are essential differences  between positive and negative association rule mining. We  will attack two key problems in negative association rule  mining: The first one is?How to effectively search for negative  frequent item sets?? and the second is ?How to effectively  identify negative association rules?? [4].

The frequent pattern tree [3] is a data structure that is used to  optimize the compression of a database representing data  transactions by using regular tree structures which make data  representation efficient. But transaction mapping [6, 7] is an  efficient approach rather than FP tree for mining data. This  approach first builds an FP-Tree. After building the FP-Tree,  an interval list for each item can be done by traveling the FP-  Tree. In the mining phase, the interval lists can determine two  items are frequent or not by intersection produce. These  approaches perform well in data mining. But, producing all the  patterns is time consuming because it consumes too many  computing resources. A new transaction mapping technique  approach for FP tree structure is introduced to improve the  storing of known frequent object sets. But little study is about  negative association rules, especially weighted negative  association rules [2] first mentions the negative relationships  between two frequent items. A correlation method [7] aims to  solve these mining problems have been proposed. But the user  can?t control the number of the flexible rules. In this paper, a  method based on the interest measure is defined. The number  of rules is restricted making use of the value of the interest  measure.



III. PROPOSED WORK  As per the discussion in the previous sections there exist  algorithms for generation of association rules such as Apriori,  Hash Based Technique, Frequent Pattern Tree Approach &  others. To find valid negative and positive association rules  there should a threshold of minimum support confidence  framework. In this section we propose a data structure such as  Frequent Positive Association Rule (FPAR) and Frequent  Negative Association Rule (FNAR) to find valid positive and  negative association rules. The detail of the proposed approach  is given in fig 1. The Proposed Approach can be described as a  five step process. In the first step we find frequent positive  objects. Second step finds negative frequent objects. In the  third step we sort the objects in order of their frequencies.

Figure 1: Proposed FPAR/FNAR Model  Then we build a FPAR and FNAR Tree during the forth step.

Finally we generate all possible positive and negative  association rules. These Association Rules both positive and  negative are considered to be valid rules. To demonstrate the  proposed model we consider a set of seven spatial objects in  Table I. These spatial objects are correlated to each other in  space. The in Table 2 we consider a sample Spatial  Transaction Dataset of 10 observations.

TABLE I. SET OF SPATIAL OBJECTS  TID Spatial Object  1 Temple(T)  2 Water(W)  3 Park(P)  4 College(C)  5 Post Office(PO)  6 Bank(B)  7 Restaurant(R)    Let consider a database table with 10 transactions and 07  spatial objects. Association rules have been mined with  threshold support of 40% for both antecedent and consequent.

In order to avoid wasted a lot of computing resources when  verifying a few frequent objects in database.  An algorithm is  proposed in figure 2. The first phase of algorithm is to  building a frequent order list to find out all the frequent  objects in the transaction table. Then from a transaction table a  FPAR/FNAR Tree is constructed. A procedure is followed by  traversing the level of the tree to generate the valid frequent  patterns which yields positive and negative association rules.

2. Call FPAR/FNAR Tree procedure to build a tree.

3. Call FPAR/FNAR pattern procedure to find out all valid  frequent patterns.

Figure 2 The procedure of algorithm  A. Frequent Order List  The procedure scans the database fully and the objects which  are present in the transaction table are inserted into positive  object list and the objects which are absent inserted into  negative object list. Then analyze the frequencies of all listed  objects. If any object does not satisfy the minimum support  count then it is discarded. Then each transaction is sorted in  descending order according to the frequency of object. The  detail is given in Figure 3.

Input:    Spatial Database (DB), minimum_support  Output: Orderlist (OL)  Procedure: Frequent Order list generates as follows  Step 1:  Scan DB and consider object[i] from object_list  Step 2:  Generate Positive and Negative object_list  For each transaction T  If object[i] ==found in object_list  Insert into positive_OL  Else  Insert into negative_OL  Step 3: For each positive_OL & negative_OL  Determine the support count for each object  Step 4: If (support count(object[i])<min_support)  Discard (object[i])  Else  Sort (object[i].list) in descending order.

Figure 3 Procedure for Frequent Order list  B. FPAR/FNAR Tree Algorithm  Secondly, each frequent object of current transaction is  inserted into the tree. If any object of the frequent pattern is  not present in the existing tree then it creates a new object  node and assigns one to the frequency. Otherwise the  frequency of child node adds one. When an object is inserted  into the tree, a frequent item node can be combined with its  parent node if and only if the parent is not root. This new node  has same properties as the current frequent object node and  can be put on the level of the parent node. The first one is  using depth first search to build a linking header for each  object. The header table is an index structure enabling one to  reach an item quickly. The second is assigning a new  transaction list for each object. A tree node is comprised of  one or many items in FPAR/FNAR Tree. Each object of this  node is appended to the header table. If sub nodes remain in  this node, then the procedure is processed recursively. On the  other hand, the next transaction number follows that of the  current transaction number. At last, the mining procedure  forms a tree where each known frequent object is combined.

This procedure stops when no more objects can be mined and  verify the last object. The figure 4 shows in details.

Procedure for FPAR/FNAR Tree generation  C. FPAR/FNAR Patterns  The FPAR/FNAR-tree is mined as follows. Start from each  frequent length-1 pattern (as an initial suffix pattern),  construct its pattern base (a ?sub database,? which consists of  the set of prefix paths in the FPAR/FNAR-tree co-occurring  with the suffix pattern), then construct its (pattern)  FPAR/FNAR-tree, and perform mining recursively on such a  tree. The pattern growth is achieved by the concatenation of  the suffix pattern with the valid frequent patterns generated  from a valid FPAR/FNAR-tree patterns as shown in figure 5.

To generate the association rules we  consider a set of transaction of spatial objects and based on the  minimum support confidence framework the algorithm  generates association rules as required.



IV. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY  In order to use the proposed approach in our study of spatial  databases system we use the concept of ordered object sets and  frequent pattern. In this approach we have considered some  spatial objects found generally in Map Databases or Spatial  Databases. The design process has the following steps as per  the algorithm described in the previous section.

Step 1: Build Ordered object sets.

Step 2: Build a Positive Frequent Association Tree  Step 3: Build a Negative Frequent Association Tree.

Step 4: Generate the optimized set of association rules.

Suppose we take min_sup is 4 and the sorted  frequent objects are College(C), Restaurant(R), Park(P),  Temple(T), Water(W), Post Office(PO), Bank(B). The  database is scanned once to find the frequent (positive)  objects. The negative objects of interest, i.e., negative objects  having support at least min_sup, can then be found. Each  transaction can be viewed as being appended with the negative  objects. For example, in TID (1) {T, W, R} is a frequent  object set. So the object which is less than the min_sup is  pruned. Now TID (1) can be viewed as a new transaction {R,  T,W,?PO,?B} if the set of negative objects is  {?PO,?B,?W,?T}. Then, each transaction will be used to  construct the FPAR/FNAR ?tree (shown in figure 3 and 4) for  mining the frequent object sets comprising both positive and  negative objects. The objects in transaction is sorted by the  support-decreasing order and then added to the FPAR/FNAR-  tree. Each transaction is gradually inserted into the tree. Let?s  take TID(2) for constructing the FPAR tree then College(C),  Restaurant(R) and Park (P) can be combined into one node  because these are the frequent objects. A new node is inserted  into the child of the tree root with transaction number as one.

Park  ?Post office ??  Bank  2 College ?Restaurant ^ Park  ?Water ? ?Temple  3 College ? Temple  4 Restaurant ? Water    When traveling the FPAR-Tree, the transaction number is  passed into the next recursive procedure. Otherwise, the  transaction number increases the current frequency of node. At  the same time, each object of a node is appended to the header  table. The object C has the largest support and there are two  nodes CRP {2, 6} and C {9, 2}. This method substantially  reduces the search costs. From the figure 6 & 7 we build the  set of positive association rules and negative association rules  as shown in Table III. For the positive and negative  association rules in Table III, support, confidence and lift have  been shown in Table IV. From table IV, the rules # whose lift  value is greater than ?1? implies a strong positive association  rule. Refer rule #3 where lift value is 1.00 is an independent  object pattern or there is no correlation between objects. But in  case of rules #5 and #6 whose lift value is also greater than ?1?  as the rules have already been expressed in negative forms,  2010 IEEE 2nd International Advance Computing Conference 407    implies actually a strong negative association rule, otherwise it  is not considered as a negative association rule. Then, for each  of the association rules with lift less than ?1? further  examination should be done for all possible negative  association rules.

TABLE IV. POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION RULE WITH  SUPPORT, CONFIDENCE AND LIFT    The generated set of association rules are known to be the  optimized set of rules or valid rules. As the generated rules are  valid rules it requires no pruning process to find invalid rules.

Thus we get a set of 3 positive association rules and 2 negative  association rules where each rule satisfy the minimum of 40%  of support. These negative valid association rules affect the  decision making process and improve efficiency of spatial  objects access.



V. TEST RESULTS  To assess the performance and efficiency of the proposed  algorithm, we conducted our experiments on a spatial database  sample to study the behaviors as compared to the existing  ones. The experiments were performed in an Intel Core Duo  T2300 1.66 GHz CPU, 1024MB memory PC running the  Windows XP. The datasets used were generated from the well-  known IBM synthetic dataset generation program [1]. The  datasets in the experiments were T10I5R50D10K and  T5I2.5R100D10K, similar to that used in [7] for mining  negative association rules. Dataset T10I5R50D10K represents  1000 transactions of average size 10 (item sets), with 50 items  and can be viewed as a dense dataset. The other one can be  characterized as a sparse dataset. The minimum confidence  and minimum interest are used in a post processing to obtain  the interesting rules. The results are compared with existing  PAR/NAR algorithm as shown in Table V using 3D Miner  Data Mining Tool. The total execution time is dependent on  the time to mining the frequent item sets, comprising both  positive and negative items.  Thus, only the results of the  discovery of frequent item sets are depicted in the following.

FNAR  outperforms the Apriori-based algorithm for all the  experiments conducted. The number of frequent items  including both positive and negative items increases as the  min_sup decreases, as shown above. The results show that  FPAR/FNAR approach has good scalability for the different  parameters. It shows FPAR/FNAR scales up linearly because  of many known frequent item sets are reducing, the repetition  of calculation greatly.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  In this paper FPAR/FNAR algorithm constructs a tree that  compresses and generates a set of generalized strong positive  and negative association rules. The algorithm predicts useful  negative rules with respect to existing positive rules by  employing frequent growth approach. Extending mining to  negative association rules can assist the recommendations  more accurately. Although the mining complexity is increased,  the experiments showed that our approach can be applied to  discover the patterns of both dense and spare datasets. The  algorithm also has linear scalability with the number of  transactions. The algorithm is efficient on simple and sparse  datasets, and has overcome some limitations of the previous  methods. The algorithm will definitely enhance the efficiency  of finding spatial objects in space with respect to their  correlation analysis. However, some further work needs to be  done on complex and dense datasets and increase its  performance. One possible way is to use max-pattern sets or  closed pattern sets, instead of all frequent pattern sets.

Secondly, we will extend this to quantitative, multilevel and  multidimensional forms, and propose the corresponding  mining methods.
