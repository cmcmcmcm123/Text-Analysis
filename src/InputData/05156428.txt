Fuzzy Association Rules in Soft Conceptual  Hierarchies

Abstract?Humans frequently use a ?divide and conquer? strategy to understand large volumes of data, by grouping similar items into progressively finer categories which form a conceptual hierarchy. Typically, such categories do not have crisp definitions but can be modelled by fuzzy set theory, allowing computers to represent and reason about sets of objects in a way that reflects the human interpretation of categories. Association rules are a useful tool in knowledge discovery from databases but are normally defined in terms of crisp rather than fuzzy categories.

In this paper, we describe a new approach to finding association rules between fuzzy categories, based on mass assignment theory.

In contrast to other fuzzy association methods, we retain a fuzzy confidence value rather than a point value.

I.  INTRODUCTION (HEADING 1) Information overload and the explosion in production,  transmission and consumption of data are well documented problems which contribute to the spread of digital obesity [1].

Often, much of the data relevant to a particular problem or decision is not held in a central, well-structured location, but is scattered over different repositories (personal filestores, web, networked databases, etc) and in many cases is held in unstructured or semi-structured formats. A recent report [2] estimated that over 80% of corporate information consists of unstructured text. Information can be drawn from diverse sources ? for example, drawing from semi-structured text data such as emails, web fora, news archives, product manuals etc as well as more traditional databases, we may face tasks such as looking for recurring themes (e.g. complaints, questions, comments), highlighting emerging issues or linking queries with relevant answers. emails, intranets, the web, etc.

Our previous work within a project entitled ?Smart Queries and Adaptive Data? (SQuAD) is concerned with adding structure to data and refining approximate knowledge from this data (see [3-6] ). Our aim is to assist in the creation of useful information from diverse sources of semi-structured data - allowing extraction and integration from multiple sources of information and re-organisation based on an individual?s personal categories. The final stage is to look for strong associations between different (fuzzy) categories.

Substantial research efforts in disparate areas such as very large databases, the semantic web, knowledge management, business intelligence, etc. have focused on the use of hierarchical approaches to categorise and summarise large quantities of data.  There is rarely a single unique hierarchy - instead, a human will choose the most appropriate way to split up the data according to their expertise / background knowledge and the problem at hand. The ability to group multiple entities together into an (approximately) uniform whole allows us to efficiently represent a whole group as a single concept, enabling us to reason, and to derive knowledge, about groups of entities. A simple form of derived knowledge is association  - essentially, that the extensions of two concepts overlap significantly. One of the fundamental tenets underlying fuzzy set theory [7] is the idea that humans work with groups of entities (or conceptual categories) that are loosely defined, able to admit elements according to some scale of membership rather than according to an absolute yes/no test.

Association rules (in their crisp form) are a well-established technique for knowledge discovery in databases, enabling ?interesting? relations to be discovered. There have been a number of proposals to develop fuzzy association rules, that is to discover the degree of association between fuzzy categories.

Some of our recent work  has used mass assignment theory [8- 10] to develop a novel approach able to find a point valued association strength between fuzzy categories [11] and an interval-valued version [12].

In common with other work on fuzzy association rules, most of our previous work assumes there is a crisp value for the rule confidence. We note that much of the power of fuzzy approaches arises from the ability to produce fuzzy results, i.e.

to effectively postpone the decision on whether a given element ?belongs? to a set or not. For example, if a cooling fan is controlled by the rules  if temperature is a little high, increase fan speed slightly if temperature is a little low, decrease fan speed slightly  then a traditional approach requires us to specify precise limits for the intervals ?a little high? and ?a little low?, and precise single values for a ?slight? increase or decrease in speed. In contrast, a fuzzy control approach allows us to define fuzzy terms and propagate them through the inference, only converting to a crisp value at the final stage when a decision  This work was partly funded by BT and the Defence Technology Centre for Data and Information Fusion (UK)   The 28th North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society Annual Conference (NAFIPS2009) Cincinnati, Ohio, USA - June 14 - 17, 2009    must be made to change the fan speed. In a similar vein, we argue that in looking for association strengths between fuzzy categories, it is better to propagate the fuzziness through the calculation and produce a fuzzy value rather than a single value to represent the confidence. Our mantra is fuzzy in, fuzzy out.

The main contribution of this paper is a novel mass assignment-based method for calculating a fuzzy confidence in associations between fuzzy categories. It relies on a new method of converting fuzzy relations to mass assignments and a definition of membership in the fuzzy confidence values related to the movement of mass needed to produce that association confidence value, relative to the confidence value derived from a least prejudiced mass assignment. The minimum and maximum values for the confidence can be found quickly, and memberships calculated based on the corresponding mass assignments. A full version, including proofs, will appear in a subsequent paper [21].



II. FUZZY SETS IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS Many authors (e.g. [13]) have proposed the use of fuzzy  sets to model uncertain values in databases and other knowledge based applications. The standard interpretation of a fuzzy set in this context is as a possibility distribution - that is to say it represents a single valued attribute which is not known exactly. For example we might use the fuzzy set tall to represent the height of a specific person or low to represent the value shown on a dice. The fuzzy sets tall and low admit a range of values, to a greater or lesser degree; the actual value is taken from the range. Knowing that a dice value val is even restricts the possible values to val=2 XOR val=4 XOR val=6 (where XOR is an exclusive or). If a fuzzy set on the same universe is defined as low = {1/1, 2/1, 3/0.4} then knowing the value val is low restricts the possible values to val=1 XOR val=2 XOR val=3 with corresponding memberships.

The conjunctive interpretation of a fuzzy set occurs when the attribute can have multiple values. For example, a person may be able to speak several languages; we could model this as a fuzzy set of languages, where membership would depend on the degree of fluency. This is formally a relation rather than a function on the underlying sets. Our position is to make a distinction between the  conjunctive interpretation - modelled by a monadic fuzzy relation ? and the disjunctive interpretation ? modelled by a possibility distribution. To emphasise the distinction, we use the notation  F(a) = {x/?(x) | x ? U}  to denote a single valued attribute F of some object a (i.e. a possibility distribution over a universe U) and  R(a) = [x/?(x) | x ? U]  to denote a multi-valued attribute (relation). Fuzzy categories represent the latter case, since we have multiple values that satisfy the predicate to a greater or lesser degree.

A. Extending Association Rules to Fuzzy Categories In creating association rules within transaction databases  (e.g. [14], see also [15] for a clear overview), the standard approach is to consider a table in which columns correspond to  items and each row is a transaction. A column contains 1 if the item was bought, and 0 otherwise. The aim of association rule mining is to determine whether or not there are links between two disjoint subsets of items ? for example, do customers generally buy biscuits and cheese when buying beer and wine?

These disjoint subsets represent categories, as described earlier.

Let I denote the set of items, so that any transaction can be represented as tr ? I, and consider X, the set of all transactions (strictly speaking, X is a multi-set but can be made into a set by adding a unique identifier to each transaction). We must also specify two categories (or itemsets) s and t, which are non- empty, non-overlapping subsets of I,  t ? I s ? I  s ? t  = ? and the sets of transactions containing s and t     !

S = x x " X # s$ x{ }  T = x x " X # t $ x{ }   An association rule is of the form s => t and is interpreted as stating that when the items in s appear in a transaction, it is likely that the items in t will also appear i.e. it is not an implication in the formal logical sense. A slight abuse of notation allows us to use S => T or  s => t as the rule.

Most authors use two measures to assess the significance of association rules. The support of a rule s => t  is the number (or relative number) of transactions in which both s and t appear, and the confidence of the rule is an estimate (based on the samples) of the conditional probability of t being contained in a transaction given that it contains s    !

Support s, t( ) = S"T  (1)    !

Conf s, t( ) = S"T  S  (2)  Typically a threshold is chosen for the support, so that only frequently occurring sets of items s and t are considered; a second threshold filters out rules of low confidence.

A simple database of names (a, b, c, d), sales and salary figures (top) and (bottom) the confidences for an association rule good sales => high salary arising from different crisp definitions of the terms good sales and high  salary  The 28th North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society Annual Conference (NAFIPS2009) Cincinnati, Ohio, USA - June 14 - 17, 2009    For example, consider a database of sales employees, salaries and sales figures. A mining task might be to find out whether the good sales figures are achieved by the highly paid employees. Given the database table in Fig 1, we can obtain rule confidences ranging from 1/3 up to 1 by different crisp definitions of ?good sales? and ?high salary?, as shown at the bottom of Fig. 1. Although this is a contrived example, such sensitivity to the cut-off points adopted for crisp definitions is a good indication that a fuzzy approach is more in line with human understanding of the categories.

Various approaches to fuzzifying association rules have been proposed e.g. [15-17]. The standard extension to the fuzzy case is to treat the sets S, T as fuzzy and find the intersection and cardinality using a t-norm and sigma-count respectively.

!

Conf S,T( ) = ?S"T x( )  x#X  $  ?S x( ) x#X  $ (3)  In the example of Fig 1, a fuzzy approach would categorise employees according to whether their salaries are high, (or medium or low) and also according to whether their sales figures are good, moderate or poor. Taking simple definitions for membership in  goodSales and highSalary leads to  S = [a/1, b/0.8, c/0.5, d/0.2] and T = [a/1, b/0.4, c/0.8, d/0.7]  which gives a confidence of 0.72 for the association S=>T using eq. (3).

As pointed out by [15], using min and the sigma count for cardinality can be unsatisfactory because it does not distinguish between several tuples with low memberships and few tuples with high memberships - for example,    !

S = x 1[ ]  T = x 1[ ]    leads to  Conf(S, T) = 0  but    !

S1 = x1 1, x2 0.01, x3 0.01,? , x1000 0.01[ ] T1 = x1 0.01, x2 1, x3 0.01,? , x1000 0.01[ ]    leads to    !

Conf S1,T1( ) = 1000 " 0.01  1+ 999 " 0.01 # 0.91  which is extremely high for two almost disjoint sets (this example originally appeared in [18]). Using a fuzzy cardinality (i.e. a fuzzy set over the possible cardinality values) is also potentially problematic since the result is a possibility distribution over rational numbers, and the extension principle [19] gives a wider bound than it should, due to neglect of interactions between the numerator and denominator in Eq 2.

For example, given  S = [x1/1, x2/0.8]  T = [x1/1, x2/0.4].

the fuzzy cardinalities are  |S ? T | = {1/1, 2/0.4} ,  |S | = {1/1, 2/0.8}  leading (by the extension principle) to a confidence of  {0.5/0.8, 1/1, 2/0.4}.

This is clearly incorrect as the confidence cannot be greater than 1, hence the extension principle is not appropriate here.



III. FUZZY RELATIONS AS MASS ASSIGNMENTS As with previous work [12, 20] we start from the fact that a  relation represents a conjunctive set of ordered n-tuples i.e. a conjunction of n ground clauses. For example, if U is the set of dice values then we could define a (crisp) predicate differBy4or5 on U ? U as the set of pairs  [(1,6), (1,5), (2,6), (5,1), (6,1), (6, 2)]  This is a conjunctive set, in that each pair satisfies the predicate. In a similar way, a fuzzy relation represents a set of n-tuples that satisfy a predicate to some degree. Thus differByLargeAmount could be represented by  [(1,6)/1, (1,5)/0.6, (2,6)/0.6, (5,1)/0.6, (6,1)/1, (6,2)/0.6]  The interpretation is not that a single pair satisfies this predicate, but that one set of pairs  satisfies it (out of several possible sets of pairs). Thus the mass assignment is on possible relations :   This is equivalent to treating the fuzzy relation as a fuzzy  set of crisp relations:   Similarly, a monadic fuzzy predicate largeValue defines a  set of 1-tuples such as [6/1, 5/0.8, 4/0.3] which is written as a fuzzy set of crisp relations:   and has the mass assignment   Our subsequent studies [20] show that this approach can  sometimes overestimate the difference between full and nearly- full membership, which can lead to unreasonably large intervals calculated for the confidence of association rules. For example, under this interpretation, the monadic fuzzy relation  S = [a/1 b/0.98] has the mass assignment    !

m S  = a[ ]{ } : 0.02, a[ ], a,b[ ]{ } : 0.98{ }  The normal mass assignment interpretation allows us to redistribute the mass on {[a], [a,b]} to either of the relations [a] or [a,b] which leads to the family of distributions:  The 28th North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society Annual Conference (NAFIPS2009) Cincinnati, Ohio, USA - June 14 - 17, 2009    S = [a] : 1-x   ,   [a,b] : x     where 0 ? x ? 0.98  This flexibility in re-assigning mass means that for a source relation  S =  [a/1 b/0.98]  and a target relation  T =  [a/1 b/0.98  c/0.02]  we get an interval [0.51, 1] which is surprisingly wide considering the two relations are so similar. We emphasise that this behaviour arises mostly in contrived cases and that smaller intervals are calculated in the vast majority of ?real? association rules encountered in experimental studies e.g. [12].

A. Alternative Interpretation of Relations as Mass Assignments The approach discussed above, which we will refer to as an  open world approach, treats partial membership of a tuple x in a relation R  (i.e. 0 < ?R(x) < 1)  as an upper bound for the mass that can be assigned to any set of tuples including x. This leads to a wide range of mass distributions that can be derived from the fuzzy relation R.

In the open world approach, for any tuple x such that ?R(x) < 1, the total mass that can be assigned to relations containing x is given by    !

0 " m t( ) t= x1,?,xn[ ] x# t  $ " % R x( )  In the largeValue example above, consider the element x=5, which has ?R(x) = 0.8; the relations containing 5 are [5, 6] and [4, 5, 6] and we have  0   ?    mlargeValue([5,6]) +  mlargeValue([4,5,6])  ?  0.8  This gives a considerable degree of flexibility in assigning mass. The alternative interpretation used in this paper - the closed world approach - regards partial membership of a tuple x in a relation R (i.e. 0 < ?R(x) < 1) as strictly equal to the total mass assigned to the sets of tuples which include x, i.e.

!

m t( ) t= x1,?,xn[ ] x" t  # = $ R x( )  This means there is no flexibility in the range of mass distributions that can be derived from the fuzzy relation R.

However, there is flexibility in the mass assignments when R is combined with an assignment corresponding to another relation, for example in calculating association confidences as described later.

Under this interpretation, the monadic fuzzy relation largeValue  discussed above has    !

mlargeValue = 6[ ] : 0.2, 6,5[ ] : 0.5, 6,5,4[ ] : 0.3{ }  and clearly  mlargeValue([5,6]) +  mlargeValue([4,5,6])  = 0.8  B. Closed world Mass-based association rules For a source category    and a target category    we can define the corresponding mass assignments as follows. Let the set of distinct memberships in S be    where     and nS ? |S|  Let    !

S i = x "  S x( ) # "S  ( i)[ ]{ } Then the mass assignment corresponding to S is   where  (7)  and we define    For example, the fuzzy category  S = [a/1, b/0.8, c/0.5, d/0.2] has the corresponding mass assignment  !

M S  = a[ ] : 0.2, a,b[ ] : 0.3, a,b,c[ ] : 0.3, a,b,c,d[ ] : 0.2{ }     We can now calculate the confidence in the association between the categories S and T using mass assignment theory.

In general, this is not a unique value as we are free to move mass (consistently) between the cells corresponding to Si  and Tj for each i, j.

For two mass assignments    !

MS = Si :mS Si( ){ }, 1" i " nS MT = Tj :mT Tj( ){ }, 1" j " nT  the composite mass assignment is  !

M = M S " M  T  = X :m X( ){ }   where m is specified by the composite mass allocation function, subject to  !

mij j=1  nT  " = mS Si( )           and   !

mij i=1  nS  " = mT Tj( )  This can be visualised using a mass tableau (see [8])  as shown in Figure 2. Each row (column) represents a relation of the source (target) mass assignment,. The mass associated with  The 28th North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society Annual Conference (NAFIPS2009) Cincinnati, Ohio, USA - June 14 - 17, 2009    a row (column) can be distributed amongst the cells provided row and column constraints are satisfied. We label the rows S1, S2, ? SnS   and columns  T1, T2, ? TnT , and assign mass mij to cell (i, j) subject to row and column constraints. The confidence in the association rule is given by  !

conf M( ) = mij " Si #Tj( )  i, j  $  mij " Si j  nT  $ %  & '  (  ) *  i=1  nS  $  = n  d  where n = mij " Si #Tj( ) i, j  $  d = mij " Si j  nT  $ %  & '  (  ) *  i=1  nS  $  = Si " i=1  nS  $ mS i( )    (7)    Clearly n ? 0, d >0  and d is a constant for a given source relation S, irrespective of M.

For example consider the fuzzy categories  S = [a/1, b/0.8, c/0.5, d/0.2]        and  T = [a/1, b/0.4, c/0.8, d/0.7]  The mass can be allocated in many ways, subject to row and column constraints. One notable assignment is the least prejudiced distribution, obtained by taking the product of source and target masses for each cell as shown in fig 2. This corresponds to the minimum entropy combination of the source and target mass assignments. Different assignments lead to the minimum and maximum confidences.

The corresponding point valued rule confidence is 1.86 / 2.5  = 0.744  We take an arbitrary mass assignment M, and consider the change in confidence when we move mass to create another assignment M*. In order to conform to row and column constraints, the net transfer of mass within any row or column is zero. Thus the simplest transfer of mass involves four cells, as shown in fig 3. We refer to this as an elementary mass transfer, denoted    and write    where  indicates that mass x is moved into cells (i1, j1) and (i2, j2)  from cells  (i1, j2) and (i2, j1) and we assume i1 < i2  and j1 < j2   Tj1  Tj2  Si1  +x  -x  Si2  -x  +x    Figure 3.  an elementary mass transfer. If x > 0 then it is termed a positive elementary mass transfer; if x < 0 it is termed a negative elementary mass  transfer  It is possible to show [21] that maximum rule confidence is obtained by moving mass towards the diagonal (top left to bottom right) and that minimum confidence is obtained by moving mass towards the bottom left - top right diagonal.

Membership Function for Fuzzy Confidence We define the membership function in terms of the quantity  of mass which must be moved (relative to the least prejudiced distribution). The least prejudiced distribution is our reference point, and the resultant confidence is taken to have membership = 1. Any other assignment of mass requires one or more elementary mass transfers relative to the LPD, and we are particularly interested in the mass assignments corresponding to minimum and maximum confidence, MMIN and MMAX. We define a fuzzy interval C representing the confidence such that  !

?C conf M( )( ) =1" pos M  LPD "M( )  N    where  !

N =max pos Mmax "MLPD( ), pos Mmin "MLPD( )( )   Because the membership function varies linearly with the amount of mass moved, it is triangular and can be calculated quickly by considering the end points. We note that it is possible for the membership function to be discontinuous at one end (i.e. to drop abruptly to zero). Figure 6 shows the membership function for the fuzzy confidence in the good sales - high salary example, with the calculations illustrated in figures 2, 4, and 5.

IV. SUMMARY Starting from the premise that fuzzy results should not be  prematurely converted into crisp values, we have developed a method which returns a fuzzy confidence for the association between two fuzzy sets, interpreted conjunctively. To our knowledge, this is the only method that generates a fuzzy confidence value for association rules. The method was developed in the context of hierarchical analysis but is suitable to calculate the fuzzy association between any pair of fuzzy sets.
