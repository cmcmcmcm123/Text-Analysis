On a Fuzzy Group-by Clause in SQLf Patrick Bosc, Member, IEEE, and Olivier Pivert

Abstract? Group-by is a core database operation that is used extensively in data analysis and decision support systems. In many application scenarios, it appears useful to group values according to their compliance with a certain concept instead of founding the grouping on value equality. In this paper, we propose a new SQLf construct that supports fuzzy-partition- based group-by (FGB). We show that FGB can be used to generate fuzzy summaries as well as to mine fuzzy association rules in a practical and efficient way.



I. INTRODUCTION  The relationships between databases and fuzzy sets have been studied for a long time. Among the very first works is that launched by L.A. Zadeh while supervising V. Tahani?s Ph.D thesis in the early 70s. The core of this study was about the design of new querying capabilities for relational databases. The basic idea was to use fuzzy sets in order to devise new predicates intended for representing a graded satisfaction instead of the ?all-or-nothing? behavior conveyed by Boolean conditions. If this type of issue was quite innovative at that time, it turns out that it has gained more and more acceptance for some years in the database community.

Many fuzzy querying approaches have been proposed in the last decades, among which a fuzzy extension of the SQL language, called SQLf [1]). This language has the same general philosophy as SQL (as to querying features and syntax in particular) and offers new possibilities regarding flexible querying. The underlying principle was to introduce graduality wherever it appeared meaningful (by using fuzzy predicates in the where clause of a base block, of course, but also by introducing fuzzy nesting operators, fuzzy quantifiers and so on). However, the group-by clause in SQLf remained unchanged with respect to SQL. As noted in [2], grouping capabilities have been extensively studied and implemented in data management systems. The standard group-by operator has relatively good execution time and scalability properties.

However, while its semantics is simple, it is also limited because it is based only on equality, i.e., all the tuples in a group have exactly the same values of the grouping attributes. In this paper, we aim to extend this core database operation by defining a ?fuzzy grouping? mechanism. The contributions of this paper are as follows:  ? we introduce the fuzzy group-by (FGB) operator which extends standard group-by to allow the formation of groups based on predefined fuzzy partitions of the attribute domains rather than equality of data,  ? we show how this mechanism makes it possible to perform some kind of data summarization ?on demand?,  Patrick Bosc and Olivier Pivert are with IRISA?ENSSAT, Lannion, France (email: {bosc, pivert}@irisa.fr)  ? we point out the interest of the FGB operator for the purpose of fuzzy association rule mining.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Section II presents the general framework of the SQLf language. Section III introduces the definition of the FGB operator and shows how fuzzy summaries can be obtained by means of appropriate aggregates applied to the fuzzy groups that are produced by this operator. Section IV discusses different forms that the complementary having clause can take. Section V deals with the way FGB can be used for mining fuzzy association rules. Section VI briefly tackles implementation aspects. Related work is presented in Section VII, and Section VIII presents the conclusions and directions for future research.



II. REMINDER ABOUT SQLF  The language called SQLf described in [1] extends SQL so as to support fuzzy queries. The general principle consists in introducing gradual predicates wherever it makes sense. The three clauses select, from and where of the base block of SQL are kept in SQLf and the ?from? clause remains unchanged.

The principal differences affect mainly two aspects : ? the calibration of the result since it is made with  discriminated elements, which can be achieved through a number of desired answers (k), a minimal level of satisfaction (t), or both, and  ? the nature of the authorized conditions as mentioned previously.

Therefore, the base block is expressed as:  select [distinct] [k | t | k, t] attributes from relations where fuzzy-cond  where ?fuzzy-cond? may involve both Boolean and fuzzy conditions. This expression is interpreted as: ? the fuzzy selection of the Cartesian product of the  relations appearing in the ?from? clause, ? a projection over the attributes of the ?select? clause  (duplicates are kept by default, and if ?distinct? is speci- fied the maximal degree is attached to the representative in the result),  ? the calibration of the result (top k elements and/or those whose score is over the threshold t).

The operations from the relational algebra ? on which SQLf rests ? are straightforwardly extended to fuzzy relations by considering fuzzy relations as fuzzy sets on the one hand and by introducing gradual predicates in the appropriate operations (selections and joins especially) on the other hand.

The definitions of these extended relational operators can be     found in [3]. As an illustration, we give the definitions of the fuzzy selection and join operators hereafter, where r and s denote two fuzzy relations defined respectively on the sets of domains X and Y .

? ?select(r, ?)(t) = >(?r(t), ??(t)) where ? is a fuzzy  condition and > is a triangular norm (most usually, min is used),  ? ?join(r, s, A, B, ?)(tu) = >(?r(t), ?s(u), ??(t.A, u.B)) where A (resp. B) is a subset of X (resp. Y ), A and B are defined over the same domains, ? is a binary relational operator (possibly fuzzy), t.A (resp. u.B) stands for the value of t over A (resp. u over B).



III. AN EXTENDED GROUP-BY CLAUSE In SQLf as in SQL, a group by clause builds a partition  based on the (atomic) values of the attributes specified in this clause. Then, ?group by A? leads to a partition where every group is associated with an A-value present in the relation.

The idea we advocate here is to extend this mechanism so as to build a partition based on intervals or fuzzy sets of values.

A. Use of a Crisp Partition  The generic form of such a query is:  select label(A) [, aggregate, ...] from r [where ?] group by label(A) using p(A) = {L1, . . . , Ln}  where p(A) is a partition defined on the domain of A, label(A) denotes any label Li from p(A), and ? is a (fuzzy or crisp) condition.

Example 1. Let Emp be a relation of schema (id, name, age, salary). Let us assume that one wants to retrieve the average salary for each age class (twenties, thirties, etc). In SQL, one has to express as many queries as there are age classes.

However, one can imagine an expression of the type:  select label(age), avg(salary) from Emp group by label(age) using p(age) = {[20, 29], [30, 39], [40, 49], [50, 59], [60, 69]}.

With the data from Table I, the result is:  {?[20, 29], 26.5?, ?[30, 39], 32?, ?[40, 49], 45?, ?[50, 59], 61?, ?[60, 69], 37? }.?  In the case where ? is a fuzzy condition, the only type of aggregate which can appear in the select clause is count, because of the difficulty of defining the other aggregates on fuzzy sets. For a given Li from p(A), count(Li) is computed the following way:  count(Li) = ?  t?r ? t.A ? Li  ??(t).

One also introduces a variant of count, denoted count- rel, which computes the relative cardinality (i.e., the average satisfaction degree) associated with a group. It is defined as:  count-rel(Li) =  ? t?r ? t.A ? Li ??(t) |{t ? r | t.A ? Li}|  .

A fuzzy partition on the domain of attribute age  Example 2. Let us consider the query:  select label(age), count, count-rel from Emp where salary is medium group by label(age) using p(age) = {[20, 29], [30, 39], [40, 49], [50, 59], [60, 69]}.

With the fuzzy term medium defined as in Fig. 2 and the data from Table I, one gets the result:  {?[20, 29], 1, 0.25?, ?[30, 39], 0.7, 0.7?, ?[40, 49], 1, 1?, ?[50, 59], 0.8, 0.4?, ?[60, 69], 0.6, 0.3?}.?  B. Use of a Fuzzy Partition  The extension to the fuzzy partition case ? which allows to take into account vague classes and to have a better robustness by making query results less sensitive to the boundaries of the classes ? is rather straightforward. One just has to have available fuzzy partitions defined on the attribute domains. On the other hand, it is not possible anymore to use any type of aggregate in the select clause: one is limited to using count even when the condition in the where clause is Boolean (since the groups themselves are fuzzy).

The fuzzy partitions used may be, e.g, Ruspini partitions [4], i.e., such that ?x ? X,  ? Li?P ?Li(x) = 1 where P  denotes a partition defined on domain X (cf. Fig. 1 and 2).

With such a fuzzy partition, a given tuple can belong to at most two classes. Ruspini partitions are probably the easiest to handle for an end-user, however the approach described hereafter is valid for any kind of fuzzy partition.

Example 3. Let us assume that one has available a fuzzy partition ? still denoted by p(age) ? defined on the domain of attribute age. Let us consider the query ?find for each fuzzy age class the number of employees which earn more than 3000 euros.? It can be expressed as:    Fig. 2. A fuzzy partition on the domain of attribute salary  TABLE II TUPLES FROM EMP AND THEIR DEGREES  #e age ?yg ?ma ?old sal ?low ?med ?high 17 51 0 0.9 0.1 65 0 0 1 76 40 0 1 0 45 0 1 0 26 24 0.6 0.4 0 19 1 0 0 12 39 0 1 0 32 0.3 0.7 0 19 28 0.2 0.8 0 24 1 0 0 8 54 0 0.6 0.4 57 0 0.8 0.2 31 29 0.1 0.9 0 18 1 0 0 9 61 0 0 1 15 1 0 0 44 22 0.8 0.2 0 45 0 1 0 23 62 0 0 1 59 0 0.6 0.4  select label(age), count from Emp where salary > 30k group by label(age) using p(age) = {young, middle-aged, old}.

With the data from Table II, the result is:  {?young, 0.8?, ?middle-aged, 3.7?, ?old, 1.5?}  where each number returned corresponds to a ?-count.? We now extend count and count-rel the following way:  count(Li) = ? t?r >(??(t), ?Li(t.A)) (1)  count-rel(Li) = ? t ? r >(??(t), ?Li(t.A))?  t ? r ?Li(t.A) . (2)  Using these two aggregates, the fuzzy group by clause makes it possible to compute fuzzy summaries ?on demand?, in contrast with the approach proposed in [5] which first builds a summary of the whole database, then uses it to answer queries. An example of a query aimed at providing a fuzzy summary is given hereafter.

Example 4a. Let us consider the query: ?what is the distri- bution over the different age classes of the employees whose salary is medium??. It can be expressed as:  select label(age), count from Emp where salary is medium group by label(age) using p(age) = {young, middle-aged, old}.

With the data from Table II, and using > = min, one gets:  {?young, 0.8?, ?middle-aged, 2.5 ?, ?old, 1.0?}.?  Example 4b. Let us now consider the query: ?which propor- tion of employees from each age class has a salary which is medium??. It can be expressed as:  select label(age), count-rel from Emp where salary is medium group by label(age) using p(age) = {young, middle-aged, old}.

With the data from Table II, and using > = min, one gets:  {?young, 0.47?, ?middle-aged, 0.43 ?, ?old, 0.4?}.?

IV. HAVING CLAUSE  The different forms of a having clause that can come as a complement to a group-by clause are described hereafter through a few examples.

A. Inclusion constraint  An example which involves a Boolean condition in the having clause is: ?find every age class such that at least 30% of the employees from that class have a high salary?:  select label(age) from Emp E1 group by label(age) having count ?  (select (count * 0.3) from Emp where salary is high and age is E1.label(age))  using p(age) = {young, middle-aged, old}.

Another example, which involves a fuzzy having clause is: ?find the extent to which all the employees of a given age class have a high salary:  select label(age) from Emp E1 group by label(age) having (select #e from Emp where salary is high)  contains set(#e) using p(age) = {young, middle-aged, old}.

The evaluation of such a query rests on a graded inclusion.

It constitutes the prototype expression for fuzzy association rule mining and will be detailed in Section V.

B. aggregate1 ? aggregate2 Even though a limitation exists as to the aggregates which  can be computed on a fuzzy set ? as already mentioned ?, it is still possible to evaluate conditions which compare two aggregates [6]. For instance: ?find the age classes such that the maximum of the technician?s salaries is greater than the minimum of the engineer?s salaries?:  select label(age) from Emp E1 where job = ?technician? group by label(age) having max(salary) >  (select min(salary) from Emp where age is E1.label(age) and job = ?engineer?)  using p(age) = {young, middle-aged, old}.

In such a query, the where clause could also involve a fuzzy condition.

C. aggregate is ?  One may also compute the extent to which an aggregate satisfies a fuzzy condition ?, by means of the approach proposed in [7]. For instance: ?find the age classes where    the average salary of engineers is high?:  select label(age) from Emp where job = ?engineer? group by label(age) having avg(salary) is high using p(age) = {young, middle-aged, old}.

Here again, the where clause can also involve a fuzzy condition.



V. USE FOR ASSOCIATION RULE MINING  A. Introduction  We now explain how the fuzzy group by clause can be used for evaluating in a simple way fuzzy association rules of the type (age is Li ? salary is L?j) where Li and L?j are two fuzzy labels defined respectively on the domain of age and that of salary. As mentioned in [8], at least two fuzzy extensions of association rules may be considered: those based on (fuzzy or scalar) cardinalities, and those based on fuzzy implications (cf. also [9] for the latter category).

Hereafter, we do not deal with fuzzy-cardinality-based rules since they may be somewhat difficult to interpret for an end-user (and also because they cannot be represented and handled easily in a purely relational DBMS).

The approach based on a scalar cardinality (?-count) rests on a straightforward extension of the usual definition of confidence. Let us consider a fuzzy association rule of the type (A is Li ? B is L?j). In this approach, the validity (confidence) of the rule is defined as:?  t?r >(?Li(t.A), ?L?j (t.B))? t?r ?Li(t.A)  In the fuzzy-implication-based approach, the rule (A is Li ? B is L?j) expresses a constraint on the B-value for each tuple in the relation. The association rule, also denoted by (A, Li)? (B, L?j), then means: ?for every tuple t, the more t.A is Li, the more t.B is L?j?, i.e.:  (A, Li)? (B, L?j)? ?t ? r, ?Li(t.A)?f ?L?j (t.B)  where ?f denotes a fuzzy R-implication. In this case, the confidence of the rule is equal to:  mint?r ?Li(t.A)?f ?L?j(t.B).

B. Rules of the type A is Li ? B is L?  1) Computation of the Support: First, one introduces a variant of count named count-g whose general definition is:  count-g(Li) = ? t ? r >(??(t), ?Li(t.A))  |r| . (3)  Let us consider the generic SQLf query:  select label(A), count-g from r where B is L? group by label(A) using p(A) = {L1, . . . , Ln}  It allows for computing the support of every fuzzy associa- tion rule of the type ?A is Li ? B is L?? for a given L?.

2) Computation of the Confidence: Let us consider the generic SQLf query:  select label(A) from r group by label(A) having (select K from r where B is L?) contains set(K) using p(A) = {L1, . . . , Ln}  where K denotes the primary key of the relation.

a) Scalar Cardinality: Using the approach based on  scalar cardinality, the confidence of the rule corresponds to the cardinality-based degree of inclusion of the fuzzy set:  E(Li) = (select #e from r where A is Li)  in the fuzzy set:  F = (select #e from r where B is L?)  i.e., to the degree ? produced by the evaluation of the having clause:  ? = ? t ? r >(?L?(t.B), ?Li(t.A))?  t ? r ?Li(t.A) .

b) R-implication: Using the approach based on a fuzzy R-implication, the confidence of the rule corresponds to the implication-based degree of inclusion of E(Li) in F ? see, e.g., [10] ?, i.e. to the degree ? produced by the evaluation of the having clause when contains is replaced by contains-f :  ? = mint?r ?Li(t.A)?f ?L?(t.B).

For instance, with ?ukasiewicz? implication (contains-Lu), we have:  ? = mint?r min(1, 1? ?Li(t.A) + ?L?(t.B)).

Example 5. Let us consider the set of rules of the form:  age is Li ? salary is medium  where Li belongs to p(age). They can be evaluated by means of the following two queries:  select label(age), count-g from Emp where salary is medium group by label(age) using p(age) = {young, middle-aged, old};  which, using the data from Table I, the partitions from Fig.

1 and 2, and > = min returns:  {0.08/?young?, 0.25/?middle-aged?, 0.1/?old?}.

and  select label(age) from Emp group by label(age) having (select #e from Emp where salary is medium)  contains set(#e) using p(age) = {young, middle-aged, old}  which returns:  {0.47/?young?, 0.43/?middle-aged?, 0.4/?old?}.

If contains were replaced by contains-Lu in the second query, we would get:  {0.4/?young?, 0.1/?middle-aged?}. ?    C. Rules of the type A is L ? B is L?i Now let us consider mining fuzzy association rules of the  type ?A is L ? B is L?i? for a given L. Again, two SQLf queries are necessary:  select label(B), count-g from r where A is L group by label(B) using p(B) = {L?1, . . . , L?n}  for computing the support of the rules considered, and:  select label(B) from r group by label(B) having set(K) contains (select K from r where A is L) using p(B) = {L?1, . . . , L?n}  for computing their confidence values.

Example 6. Let us consider the set of rules of the form:  age is young ? salary is L?i where L?i belongs to p(salary). They can be evaluated by means of the following two queries:  select label(salary), count-g from Emp where age is young group by label(salary) using p(salary) = {low, medium, high}  and  select label(salary) from Emp group by label(salary) having set(#e) contains  (select #e from Emp where age is young) using p(salary) = {low, medium, high}.

With the data from Table I and the partitions from Fig. 1 and 2, the first query returns:  {0.09/?low?, 0.08/?medium?, 0/?high?}.

As to the second one ? which corresponds to the scalar cardinality approach since it involves the operator contains ?, it returns the result:  {0.53/?low?, 0.47/?medium?, 0/?high?}.

If contains were replaced by contains-Lu in the second query, we would get: {0.2/?low?, 0.4/?medium?, 0.2/?high?}. ?

VI. ABOUT THE EVALUATION OF A FUZZY GROUP-BY The complexity of the evaluation of an FGB clause is very  similar to that of a regular group-by clause. Two cases may be distinguished: ? if the attribute appearing in the FGB clause ? let us  denote it by A ? is indexed, it is possible to directly access the tuples which belong to a given fuzzy class Li: they are the tuples t such that t.A ? support(Li). Let us recall that the support of a fuzzy label is expressed as an interval and can be straightforwardly determined from the membership function associated with that label. The degree to which tuple t belongs to class Li is equal to ?Li(t.A).

? otherwise, as usual, one may sort the relation on at- tribute A and compare the A-value of each tuple with  the (overlapping) segments which correspond to the supports of the different fuzzy labels in the partition of domain(A) in order to build the fuzzy groups. Here too, of course, ?Li(t.A) must be computed for each tuple t.

As can be seen, the cost of the evaluation of an FGB clause should be more or less equivalent to that of a regular group- by clause since the only additional cost is that related to the computation of the membership degrees.



VII. RELATED WORK A. Extended Group-by  The work in [11] proposes some SQL constructs to make clustering facilities available from SQL in the context of spatial data. Basically, these constructs act as wrappers of conventional clustering algorithms but no further integration with database systems is studied. Li et al. [12] extend the group-by operator to approximately cluster all the tuples in a predefined number of clusters. Their framework makes use of conventional clustering algorithms, e.g. K-means, and employ summaries and bitmap indexes to integrate clustering and ranking into database systems. Silva et al. [2] introduce a similarity group-by operator in order to group objects with similar values. Our study differs from [12] and [2] in that (1) we focus on fuzzy grouping based on vague concepts, not on similarity-based grouping; (2) we do not aim at ?discovering? the clusters, since in our approach the groups are explicitly specified in the query (by means of a fuzzy partition), which by the way gives them a well-identified meaning; and (3) the authors of [12] and [2] do not consider a general fuzzy querying framework such as SQLf (where the fuzzy group- by construct is just a piece of the puzzle) but only extend a particular feature of SQL.

B. Fuzzy Database Summarization Techniques Developed by Rasmussen and Yager, SummarySQL [13] is  a fuzzy query language which can evaluate the truth degree of a summary guessed by the user. A summary expresses knowledge about the database in a statement under the form ?Q objects in DB are S? or ?Q R objects in DB are S? where DB stands for the database, Q is a linguistic quantifier and R and S are linguistic terms. The expression is evaluated for each tuple and the associated truth values are later used to obtain a truth value for the summary. The statements considered by the authors are in a sense more general than the fuzzy association rules that we deal with, since they involve fuzzy quantifiers. However, our approach can easily be extended to capture such statements by relaxing the operator contains that appear in the having clause, using e.g. one of the approaches described in [10]. When it comes to mining fuzzy statements, the main difference lies in the fact that [13] does not propose any SQL construct to evaluate these statements ?in a batch? as we do thanks to the FGB clause: the statements have to be checked one by one and no fuzzy partitioning of the domains is used.

In [5], Saint-Paul et al. propose an approach to the production of linguistic summaries structured in a hierarchy,    i.e., a summarization tree where the tuples from the database are rewritten using the linguistic variables involved in fuzzy partitions of the attribute domains. The main difference with our approach is that [5] views summarization as an independent process, which is not performed by means of SQL queries but by a specific algorithm. As mentioned before, the FGB operator enables to obtain summaries ?on demand? without having to summarize the whole database.

C. Mining Association Rules with SQL  The use of SQL queries for mining association rules has been advocated by several authors, see e.g. [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. However, none of these ap- proaches considers an extended group-by mechanism, and none considers fuzzy association rules either. To the best of our knowledge, the only approach which uses a fuzzy extension of SQL for mining fuzzy association rules (or gradual functional dependencies, as the authors call them) is [21], which relies on SummarySQL already discussed in the subsection above.



VIII. CONCLUSION  In this paper, we have introduced a fuzzy group-by (FGB) operator based on the use of fuzzy partitions of attribute domains and described how it could be integrated into the SQLf language. The main goal of FGB is to generate more meaningful and useful groupings than the regular group-by operator. We have shown how this construct makes it possible to generate fuzzy summaries ?on demand?, as well as to mine fuzzy association rules in a practical way.

Among perspectives for future work, let us mention:  ? implementation aspects and experimentations: it is of course important to make sure that queries involving a fuzzy grouping have execution times comparable to those involving a classical group-by. One can be rea- sonably optimistic about this issue given the results pre- sented in [2] about a similarity-based group-by (SGB), which show that the overhead in this case is no more than 25%. FGB should be even more efficient than SGB since i) the clusters are predefined, ii) the use of fuzzy partitions still makes it possible to employ evaluation techniques based on sorts and/or indexes (cf. Section VI).

? an investigation about the way other measures than support and confidence for assessing fuzzy association rules, cf. [22], could be taken into account;  ? a variant of the approach described here, aimed at expert users, where fuzzy cardinalities would be computed instead of scalar ones. In a fuzzy association rule mining context, this implies computing the validity of the rules by means of a technique such as that described in [23];  ? an extension of the format of the rules to be mined, for instance through a relaxation of the universal quantifier based on one of the approaches proposed in [10].
