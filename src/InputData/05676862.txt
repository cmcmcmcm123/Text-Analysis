Abstract?As the de facto standard, Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) is widely used in the composition and orchestration of web services; however, it is tiring and error- prone if we just rely on the developers to create every activity icon and assign it an atomic service. On the basis of the author?s early work, this paper creatively applies association rules mining to the analysis of BPEL process, and put forwards a recommendation method of BPEL activity based on Labeled Activity Tree (LAT) and sub-activity sequence (subASeq).

Finally, the experiment result of the BPEL processes in a multimedia conference system indicates this method?s validity.

I. INTRODUCTION As the de facto standard, Business Process Execution  Language (BPEL) [1] is widely used in the composition and orchestration of web services; however, nowadays, despite with the help of some semiautomatic BPEL development tools such as ActiveBPEL, it is still necessary for the developers to create every activity icon and decide which atomic service it should be assigned to. In fact, when constructing BPEL processes in a specific business domain, the number of the atomic services is finite, and maybe there is causality between some of these services. If we can dig out the association relationship between these atomic services, then we can provide some activity recommendation information to the developers to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the BPEL documentation?s compilation. Also, this kind of association relationship can be used to build the template of BPEL subprocesses. On the basis of BPEL process?s workflow specialty and inspired by the idea of the algorithm (association rules mining with sliding window) in the author?s early work [5], this paper creatively applies the association rules in data mining to the analysis of BPEL, and intents to find out the tightly related activities in BPEL processes by making use of Labeled Activity Tree (LAT) and sub-activity sequence (subASeq) after sliding window is introduced. Finally, using the BPEL processes of a multimedia conference system as the experiment data source, the result indicates the method?s validity.



II. RELATED WORK The paper is the first attempt about the recommendation of  BPEL activity. With regard to the segmentation of BPEL, activity sequence and subprocess, there has been some related research. Reference [2] advanced a static process slicing algorithm based on BPEL control flow graph (BCFG) and activity dependency graph (ADG). Reference [3] tried to find out reusable BPEL subprocesses through variable dependence.

This paper is inspired by the early work [4, 5] and derived from the author?s consideration whether it is possible to apply the algorithm in [5] to the scene of [4] in order to discover the activities with inner relationship. Compared with [2,3,4], which concerned the segmentation of BPEL process from the view of data stream and control stream at the level of subprocess, this paper is from the standpoint of the association rules mining of activity sequence and is at the level of activity, with finer grain.



III. ASSOCIATION RULES  A. Related Concepts Association rule is one of the mining technology of data  mining, and it is used for finding out related itemsets from large numbers of transactions. A typical application is, from abundant shopping basket records, to discover the fact that the consumers have the custom of buying diapers and beer at the same time, thus we get a rule like diapers ? beer. The definitions of association rules are as follows:  1) itemset: The set of items. We suppose { }m,...,I,III 21=  represents the set of all items.

2) K-itemset: The itemset which contains K items.

3) Transaction: Transaction is a set of items. Supposing  there is a transation T, satisfying IT ? .

4) Transaction set:The set of transactions. Suppose D is a  Transaction set, then { }n21 ,...,T,TTD = .

5) Association rule: An implication in the form of  BA? , with IBIA ?? ? and ?=? BA .Rule BA?  has two measurement parameters: support and  confidence, having )()(support BAPBA ?=?  and )()(confidence B|APBA =? .A rule satisfies both  MIN_SUPPORT and MIN_CONFIDENCE is called strong rule.

B. Microsoft_Association_Rules In this paper, the algorithm that the experiment used is  Microsoft_Association_Rules Algorithm. It is an improvement and optimization of Apriori Algorithm and saves the memory space by using the data structure of tree.

Microsoft_Association_Rules Algorithm has two main steps: mining the frequent itemsets and generating rules based on the frequent itemsets, which are explained below:  1) Mining the frequent itemsets This step uses an iterative method, this means that  itemsets(K) is used for exploring itemsets(K+1). Firstly, by scanning the database, count on each item, collect all the items satisfying MIN_SUPPORT, and call the set of these items as  1L .Then 1L  is used for seeking 2L ,and 2L  is used for seeking 3L , and so forth , finally we stop at frequent itemsets(K) if there is no frequent itemsets(K+1) satisfying MIN_SUPPORT.

2) Generating rules based on the frequent itemsets For each frequent itemset  f, generate all the subset x and its  complementary set xfy ?= , if: CONFIDENCEMINyxconfidence _)( >? ,  then yx ?  is a qualified strong association rule.



IV. BPEL MODELING AND TRANSACTIONS CREATION In essential, BPEL is a business process, and it describes  the business process procedure in a specific domain. Because of this specialty, we can model the BPEL process, extract all the interesting activities and arrange them in the original logical order in BPEL process to build a LAT. Then, we get all the LASeqs(Longest Activity Sequence) by tranversing from the root to the leaves of LAT. Finally, by introducing the notion of sliding window, we transform LASeqs to the input transactions of association rules: sub-activity sequences.

A. The Mapping of  Base Activity Since what we will excavate is the inner relationship  between the activities, and what we concern is the causality between the atomic services BPEL activity invokes, we only show our interest on three types of base activities: receive, reply and invoke. For briefness, activity is represented as ActivityType_ActivityName, ActivityType is the type of the activity, having },,{peActivityTy INVRPLRCV? , in which RCV, RPL and INV are the abbreviations of receive, reply and invoke respectively. ActivityName is the name of the activity, which is uniquely identified by partnerLink, portType and operation. The mapping of the base activities of BPEL process is shown in TABLE1.

TABLE I.  THE MAPPING OF BASE ACTIVITIES OF BPEL PROCESS  The Base Activities of BPEL Process  Mapped as  <receive partnerLink= ?a? operation= ?b? portType= ?c? variable=?>  RCV_abc  <invoke partnerLink= ?a? operation= ?b?  INV_abc  portType= ?c? inputVariable=? outputVariable=?>  assign\faultHandlers\eventHandlers \wait\empty\scope\process\terminate  null  B. The Mapping of Structured Activity For the structured activities in BPEL: sequence, if/else,  while, flow, their mapping mode is shown in Fig. 1.

For the activity forEach and repeatUntil, their mapping mode is the same as while. Because we just care about the association relation between the activities, activity?s repeat times will be ignored, and the activities in the circular structure will be mapped only once.

Figure 1.  The Mapping Mode Of  Structured Activities Of  BPEL Process  C. Constructing Labeled Activity Tree Mapping the base activities in BPEL to nodes, structured  activities to connecting lines, in which sequence, while, forEach, repeatUntil are mapped as the lines connecting contained activities orderly, if/else and flow are mapped as the lines connecting contained activities parallelly, then an activity tree(AT) is built. Labeling the nodes in AT will get LAT. The method of labeling is: each node in AT is labeled using a pair (m, n), m denotes the level this node lies in AT, and n denotes this node is the nth node in level m. A labeled activity is expressed as Triple=(ActivityType_ActivityName, m, n). Fig.

2 is an example of a LAT.

Figure 2.  An example of a Labeled Activity Tree  D. Activity Sequence after Introducing Sliding window After constructing LAT, the next step is to find out all the  LASeqs in LAT. LASeq is a path from the root to a leaf of LAT. It is worth noting that, because of the existence of flow    and if/else, there is some difference between LAT and general multi-tree, that is, two branches in LAT have the possibility to converge later on. Actually, the number of LASeqs is equal to or larger than the number of leaves in a LAT. The pseudocode of obtaining all the LASeqs is as below:  1) Symbol Definition ? root: root node of LAT  ? Seq: activity sequence  ? tailOfSeq(Seq): the last node in Seq  ? children(node)?the set of all the direct children of node  ? countOfChildren(node): the number of the direct children of node  ? add(Seq?node): add node to the tail of  Seq  ? add(S, Seq): add Seq to the set S  ? remove(S, Seq): remove Seq from set S  ? newSeq =copy(Seq): copy Seq as a new sequence, namely, newSeq  2) Algorithm of Creating LASeqs(ACL)   Input: a LAT Output: all the LASeqs of this LAT Algorithm (ACL):  S;return         19.

jj  j  j  > ++  =  ? =  => =  =  ? =  ==  ?=?= =  S  S    The result of ACL should guarantee that all the LASeqs are not the same. Two LASeqs are the same implies that these two LASeqs have the same length and the corresponding activity nodes (expressed as Triple) are the same. In the LAT in Fig. 2, there are two LASeqs in all: LASeq1? (Activity1,1,1)(Activity2,2,1)(Activity3,3,1)(Activity5,4,1) (Activity6,5,1) LASeq2? (Activity1,1,1)(Activity2,2,1)(Activity4,3,2)(Activity5,4,1) (Activity6,5,1)  However, there is only one leaf node: Activity 6.

3) Introducing Sliding window  In order to get the input transactions of association rules mining, the notion of sliding window is introduced. Sliding window glides on LASeq from the beginning to the end, one activity at a time, thereout some subASeqs are gotten. The size of the sliding window is decided by the number of related activities we are interested with. Still take Fig. 2 as an example, if we want to get the association relation between two activities, i.e. activity B always appears after A on condition that they have some inner causality, in this case, the size of the sliding window should be set to 2.

After introducing sliding window with size 2(Fig.3), LASeq1 produces four subASeqs:  (Activity1,1,1)(Activity2,2,1),(Activity2,2,1) (Activity3,3,1),  (Activity3,3,1) (Activity5,4,1),(Activity5,4,1)(Activity6,5,1).

In like manner, LASeq2 also produces four subASeqs:  (Activity1,1,1)(Activity2,2,1),(Activity2,2,1) (Activity4,3,2),  (Activity4,3,2) (Activity5,4,1),(Activity5,4,1)(Activity6,5,1).

Finally, the LAT in Fig. 2 has eight subASeqs in all.

Collect all the subASeqs of all the BPEL processes in a specific business domain, and keep only the first term (ActivityType_ActivityName) in every activity?s Triple, we will get all the input transactions for the association rules mining.

V. EXPERIMENT RESULT AND ANALYSIS The experiment data source from a multimedia conference  system in the author?s laboratory. It contains 19 BPEL processes with 63 interesting activities after mapping. The tool      Figure 4.  The Result of Association Rules Mining  used for association rules mining is Microsoft SQL Server2005 [6].When the size of the sliding window is set to 2, it produces 269 subASeqs. The algorithm parameters of mining model are:  MIN_SUPPORT = 0.035  MIN_PROBABILITY (viz. MIN_CONFIDENCE) = 0.4.

Here we illustrate the modeling of a BPEL process in conference system (Fig.5). After the neglection of scope\assign\eventHandlers, the LAT is shown in Fig. 6.

Figure 5.  A BPEL process in Multimedia Conference System    Figure 6.   LAT of BPEL process in Fig.5  The mining result is shown in Fig.4, four rules are obtained, and they are consistent with the conference logic.

Rule1 indicates that, after conference BPEL process?s invoking getMedia, setMedia is always invoked in succession.

getMedia is used for querying a participant?s supported media condition, and setMedia is used for setting new media condition for the participant. In fact, before the ?setting?, ?querying? is necessary, in order to avoid the mistake that a participant has no camera but is required to receive conference video. Rule2 is also reasonable, because the function of getConfInfo is to get conference chairman?s ID, which is an indispensable parameter to invoke the immediate informChairman.

Thus, during the procedure of constructing a BPEL process, when the developer creates an activity IVK_getMedia, we can recommend IVK_setMedia to him/her, this is helpful in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of BPEL document?s compilation.



VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK The method in this paper mines out those highly related  activities, which are internally tightly-coupled and can be applied in the creation of BPEL template and subprocess in the subsequent work. In addition, some BPEL base activities? mappings are ignored here, and they can be added to be considered in future research.
