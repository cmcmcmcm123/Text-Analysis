Top-down Mining Frequent Closed Patterns in Microarray Data

Abstract?Mining frequent closed patterns play an important role in mining association rules in microarray data. The bottom- up search strategy for mining frequent closed patterns cannot make full use of minimum support threshold to prune search space and results in long runtime and much memory overhead.

TP+close algorithm based on top-down search strategy addressed the problem. However, it determined a frequent pattern was closed by scanning the set of frequent closed patterns that have been found.  For dense datasets, the algorithm performance will be seriously affected by the scan time. In this paper, we proposed an improved tree structure, TTP+tree. Based on the tree, a top-down algorithm, TTP+close, was developed for mining frequent closed patterns in microarray data. TTP+close checked the closeness property of itemset by the trace-based method and thus avoided scanning the set of frequent closed patterns. The experiments show that TTP+close outperforms TP+close when dealing with dense data.

I. INTRODUCTION With the development of bioinformatics, microarray  technology produced lots of microarray data.  Making use of data mining techniques could discover interesting knowledge from these data. However, different from transactional datasets, microarray data usually contain a huge number of columns (genes) and few rows (samples).

Therefore, most of the existing algorithms based on column enumeration for mining frequent closed pattern were not suitable for microarray data.

Pan et al. proposed the CARPENTER [1] based on row enumeration strategy. The algorithm  proposed to search the rowset space rather than the columnset space. It cannot make full use of the minimum support threshold to prune the rowset search space.

Liu et al. [2] proposed an approach which adopted top- down rowsets search strategy. The algorithm used trace- based closeness-checking method and other strategies to decide whether an itemset is closed. But it built many conditional tables or IP_Lists without any frequent closed patterns were output.

Miao et al. [3, 4] also introduced top-down method and applied the suffix-based, divide-and-conquer method for mining frequent closed patterns. TP+close [3] used the row enumeration strategy to prune the search space and  employed TP+-tree structure to achieve compression storage. When the algorithm outputs one frequent closed pattern, it must scan the set of frequent closed patterns that have be obtained to check whether the frequent closed pattern exists. This affects the performance of TP+close as processing the dense datasets.

Inspired by the TP+close, in this paper, we proposed an improved structure TTP+tree. Based on the structure, an algorithm TTP+close was presented. TTP+close checked the closeness property of itemset by the trace-based method, avoided scanning the set of frequent closed patterns that have been found, and therefore accelerated the search speed.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 states the problem definition and related terms. Section 3 introduces the TP+-tree and suffix class. In Section 4 we describe the improved structure TTP+tree and algorithm TTP+close. In Section 5 we present our experimental result.

In Section 6 we summarize our study.



II. PROBLEM DEFINITION Let 1 2 3 mI {i , i , i ,..., i }=  be a set of items, and  1 2 nD {t , t ,..., t }=  a dataset of transactions, where each transaction has a unique identifier tid  and contains a set of items. The set of all tids is denoted as T . A set X I?  is also called an itemset , and a set Y T?  is called a tidset . An itemset with K  items is called a k itemset? . An itemsets I is contained in a transaction t D?  if I t? . For convenience we write an itemset {a, b,c}  as abc and a tidset {2,3,5} as 235.

Let X and Y , X T?  and Y I? .The concept of closed item is based on the two following functions, f and g :  f (X) {i I | t X,i t}= ? ? ? ? g(Y) {t T | i Y,i t}= ? ? ? ? Definition 1 An itemset Y  is said to be closed if and  only if c(Y) f (g(Y)) f g(Y) Y= = = , where the composite function c is called the closure operator.

Definition 2 sup(Y) | g(Y) |= is called the absolute support threshold of Y , Y I?  and | g(Y) | divided by | T | is called relative support threshold.

The number of transactions which contain Y is called absolute support threshold of pattern Y. The percentage of   DOI 10.1109/WGEC.2009.201     transactions which contain Y is called relative support threshold.

Definition 3 If itemset Y is closed and | g(Y) |= sup(Y) min_ sup?  is held, the itemset is called frequent closed pattern.

The problem of mining frequent closed pattern in microarray data can be described as following: given a microarray dataset D and a user-specified minimum support threshold minsup, all frequent closed patterns which satisfied the minsup are discovered.



III. TP+-TREE STRUCTURE AND SUFFIX CLASS  A. TP+-tree Structure TP+-tree is a prefix tree. For traversing conveniently, all  nodes which have the same tide in TP+-tree are linked to linked list, and all nodes with the same tide in TP+-tree  are linked to the tid  header table. It can traverse all nodes by header table pointer.

TP+-tree  mainly consists of  root node marked with ?null? , tid prefix subtree as the children of  root node, itemset structure pointing to corresponding nodes in tree and tid header table. Every node includes four fields (tid, level, sid_link, item_ link). The tid stores transaction identifier of the node. The item_link links the relative itemsets structure or it is null. The field of level denotes the level of node in the tree, and the level of root node is 0.  The sid _ link links the node which has the same tid as itself. It will be null if there is no same tid node. The tid header table consists of two parts (tid, head). The last field head links the first node of tid list.

TABLE I.  THE EXAMPLE DATASET  Tid Items  1 adfghln  2 acdehm  3 bdfj  4 cegikmn  5 bdefjkl  For example, the dataset as table 1, suppose the minimum support threshold, minsup is 2. Figure 1 shows the TP+-tree structure corresponding to dataset in table 1 .The number in the bracket of node is the level of the node. The number out of the bracket denotes the transaction identifier tid. The itemset beside the node denotes that the itemset is included in every transaction from the node to root node. For example, g (d) =1523 indicates that the four transactions contain itemset d respectively. With the condition that c(d) f (g(d)) f (1523) d= = = , itemset d is frequent closed pattern.

B.  Suffix Class Given tid set T in certain order, T is a sequence. Let  U T? ? s(U,k) is defined to obtain suffix with k identifiers, 0 ? k  ?|U |.A tid sequence can be obtained on  the path in TP+-tree from root node to every node. In fact, the sequence is a subsequence of T.  As is shown in figure 1, an ordered transaction set 524 can be obtained from root node to leaf node 4(3). Supposing R is sequence transaction sets from TP+-tree root node to all other nodes.

An equivalent relation ?  based on suffix class in transaction sets R is that U? , V R? , U V s(U,1)? ? = s(V,1) . It means that last tid of two tidsets are equal and two sets are equivalence class. Equivalent class R which relating to ?  can ascertain the divisions of R uniquely. The equivalent class which takes transaction identifier r for suffix is called suffix class r? [r] as the abbreviated form.

To the members of suffix class, we use signal Y g(Y)? ? where Y  is itemset, and g(Y) represents transaction set. In figure 1, suffix class [3]={d 1523, f 153? ? , bj 53}? .

IV. TTP+TREE STRUCTURE AND TTP+CLOSE ALGORITHM  A.  Trace-based Closeness-checking Method TTD-close [2] uses a new closeness-checking technique  which is trace-based closeness-checking method. This strategy judges that whether the intersection sets of all the tids traversed by the itemsets is null, then determines if itemset is closed.

By analyzing this strategy, it can be applied to TP+close to avoid scanning FCP outputted. Take the suffix class [2] as an example when the elements contained in suffix class [3] is outputted, itemset d points to the parent node 2(3) of node 3(4). The d has pointed to 3(4) ? therefore, 3 is reserved as trace traversed by d. The traversed collection of d is 3.It is not null. That indicates d in suffix class [2] is not closed pattern. When the frequent closed patterns included in [2] are exported, the element  d 152?  doesn?t scan FCP outputted.  Because 3 is the trace traversed by d, frequent closed pattern d must have been outputted.  We can also conclude that the element in [2] is not frequent closed pattern. In like manner the element e 52?  in [2] is not frequent closed pattern, because the trace of e is 4. The tidset intersection for d 152? and e 52 ?  is 52. The new intermediate results de 52?  can be obtained. The tidset traversed by the intermediate results can be obtained by the intersection of elements d 152? and e 52?  traversed     tidsets. Because A is null, the new element de 52?  is a frequent closed pattern.

In order to implement the closeness-checking, a field track_link is added to the itemset structure. This field stores intersection of certain itemset contained in the same suffix.

It is found that the level number in tree node can be transferred from tree node to itemset structure to save space, since the level numbers are only used on traversing the structure.

The improved TP+-tree node contains three fields (tid,sid _ link,item _ link) . The field item _ link points to itemset structure that includes three fields such as (itemset, level, trace _ link) . The field itemset  stores itemset contained by tid of all tree nodes in the path from root node to this tree node. The field level  indicates the level number of tree node pointed by itemset structure. The number subtract one only when the item structure is passed to parent node. The meaning of the field trace _ link   is intersection of tidset in field itemset . We name the improved TP+-tree as TTP+tree. In figure 2? the TTP+tree is shown.

Figure 2.  TTP+tree  B. TTP+close Algorithm With the analysis, it can be included that applying  bitmap technique can implement the function of transpose table in [3], and reduce the memory space. Therefore, the bitmap is introduced to optimize algorithm.

Building TTP+tree at first, the algorithm is as follows? Procedure Const_TTP+tree (D, minsup)  Input: Dataset D and minimum support threshold minsup;  Output? TTP+tree corresponding Datasets D? Method?  1. Scan datasets D and build bitmap BT which contains only frequent 1-itemset. Build sequence tid ordered in descending order, and save it to head table.

2. Build TTP+tree. Create root node T, and execute the following procedure to every column of bitmap? according to tid sequence built by step 1, read the tid in column of bitmap that value is 1 and write the tid sequence to array P. Call insert_tree (P, T).

Procedure insert_tree (P, T)  1) To ip in P, if tid in node of T and tid of ip  are the same and ip  is the last element of P, item_link of tree node points to this itemset  of ip  and itemset. level  is recorded as the level of tree node, also itemset. trace _ link is null and return. If ip  is not the last element of P , check whether jp exists in T ? j ip p? .

2) If there is no node with the same tid  as that of jp , create a new node. Initialize the new node and insert it to the corresponding linked list of header table . Return step1.

Algorithm   TTP+close (D, minsup) Input: Dataset D , minimum support threshold minsup Output: Frequent closed patterns FCP and support  Method: 1. Call Const_TTP+tree (D, minsup) 2. Search the header table by bottom-up strategy and if  the number rest tids in header table  less than minsup, return.

3. Create array N that consist of elements of suffix class [n] by traversing field sid _ link .

4. Insert the itemset structure which corresponding every element in array N to the item _ link  field of its parent?s node, then level level 1= ? .

Simultaneously, updating the field tranc _ link .

5. Call SubTTP+close(N)?and executing step 2.

Procedure SubTTP+close (N) Begin  1) for each element i in g(n )?  in N 2)   for each element j jn g(n )?  in N? jn < in 3) i j i jn ' n n ,g(n ') g(n ) g(n )= ? = ? , i jt ' t t= ?  ? 4)     If | g(n ') | min_ sup?  then 5)     If i jg(n ) g(n )=  then 6) Delete j jn g(n )? and jt from  N ?  and  substitute n ' for  in ? t ' for it ? including sub-nodes?  7)      If i jg(n ) g(n )?  then 8) Substitute n ' for in ? t ' for it ? including  sub-nodes? 9) If i jg(n ) g(n )? and g(n ') is not discovered  then 10)         add n ' g(n ')? and t ' to N ' 11)     End if 12) End for 13) If N ' ? ?  then SubTTP+close(N?) 14) If it is null then store i in g(n )? to FCP 15) End for  Because in procedure Const_ttp+tree, the sid_ink sorted in ascending order according to level number of tree node, the state i jg(n ) g(n )? will never happen. Accordingly, the state is deleted. In the algorithm TTP close+ , not only does N contain element in suffix class, but also it contains the     intersection of tidsets which each element traversed. In steps 9, the program only needs scanning the FCP outputted by this suffix. In step 14, i in g(n )?   is a frequent closed pattern depending on whether it  is null or not. The strategy will avoid scanning FCP or whole. As a result, the algorithm performance is upgraded.



V.   PERFORMANCE STUDIES In this section, we will evaluate TTP+close in terms of  the efficiency. All experiments were performed on a PC with a Pentium D 3.0Ghz CPU, 1GB RAM and an 80GB hard disk running Windows XP. The algorithm was coded in standard C++. We introduced two real-life microarray gene expression datasets denoted by AML1_ETO [8] and BCR_ABL [9] which we use to measure the execution time of our proposed algorithm.

We compared TTP+close with the algorithm TP+close.

Figure 3 shows the experimental result on dataset AML1- ETO. When minsup is 2, TTP+close performance has been improved more than one time over TP+close. With the increase of minsup TTP+close performance has improved much lower. If the minsup is more than 8, the two algorithms perform with almost the same time. It is because that with the increasing of support threshold, the number of frequent closed pattern gets much less and what has to be closeness checked get much less too.

Figure 3.  Running for AML1_ETO  Figure 4 shows the comparison results with TP+close on dataset BCR_ABL. If minsup is 2, BCR_ABL contains more than thirty thousand frequent closed patterns. The algorithm performance has been improved nearly five times   Figure 4.  Running for BCR_ABL  over TP+close. If minsup is 8, the frequent closed patterns outputted are less than twenty thousand, and the performance falls sharply. TTP+close also uses binary bitmap to save space, which speed up the tree structure establishing. In conclusion, TTP+close outperform TP+close processing very high dimension dense datasets.

Especially with the low support threshold, the algorithm performance has been improved prominently.



VI. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have investigated the problem of  efficiency in algorithm TP+close from microarray datasets, and proposed an improved algorithm TTP+close based on TTP+tree. The algorithm checked the closeness property of itemset by the trace-based method and thus avoided scanning the set of frequent closed patterns. The experiment shows that TTP+close outperforms TP+close algorithm.
