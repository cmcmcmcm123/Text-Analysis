A Solution based on Data Mining to Shelf Space Allocation

Abstract-For the retailing, the shelf space allocation is a key issue which impacts on the retailer's product sales and profits  directly. For the small-scale supermarket, due to the small store and the product variety, the traditional 'format style' shelf space layout is not appropriate. To solve this problem, a shelf space allocation solution based on data mining techniques  is proposed in this paper. With the introduction of association distance, we realize the description of the relevance between two any items purchased together in transaction database.

With the concept of promotions coefficient, we get the  description of the promotions ability of two items. Based on these concepts, with the cluster analysis techniques and the association rule mining technique, we propose a resolution based on 'island style', and get the optimization and  automation of shelf space allocation in the small-scale supermarket.

I. INTRODUCTION  For retailers, shelf space allocation is directly related to the product sales and profits. To increase sales and profits, retailers need to determine which products are on display, as well as how to allocate the shelf space in store. Studies have shown that the visual impact of products shelf space can stimulate the customers' shopping impulse, which occupies 70 percent of the purchase decision [1]. Good shelf space allocation can not only attract customers and reduce product inventory, more importantly, it can reduce operating cost and increase profits.

Now, most of literatures about the shelf space allocation focus on the model and algorithm. In the algorithm research, Corstjens and Dolye designed a generalized geometric programming method[2-3]; Yang also put forward a heuristic algorithm with regulation[4]; Andrew Lim and Brian Rodrigues designed a new heuristic algorithm, network flow algorithm and the Five-phase SWOL method[5]; Liang put forward a hybrid genetic algorithm and a local search algorithm for the problem[6]. However, most of these algorithms are local search algorithm, which are difficult to find the global optimal solution. In the model search, space elasticity is a widely used solution. In this model, taking into account of profits, inventory costs and distribution costs.

However, this model didn't take into account of cross selling.

Furthermore, the research is aiming at the shopping malls, not applicable to the small retail shop. To solve this problem,    we introduce an island-style shelf space allocation solution based on the association rule mining and cluster analysis techniques.

Section 2 describes the shelf space allocation problem and gives an account of relevant concepts. Section 3 describes in detail the relevant algorithm. Section 4 presents the relevant algorithm with sample data while Section 5 concludes the paper.



II. PROBLEM SPECIFICATION  Among the patterns of shelf layout, the grid-style pattern is the most widely used one, especially in the big mall. In this layout, shelves and customer channels are arranged as rectangular array, main channel and sub-channel are of same width, all of the shelves are arranged parallel or at right angles. The grid-style pattern has the advantage of a clear classification. According to the commodity group, customers can quickly fmd the goods they want to purchase. Presently, most of literatures about the shelf space allocation are based on the pattern. For small-scale shopping malls, in addition to the grid-style pattern, it can also adopt an island-style pattern.

In this pattern, the hypermarkets are arranged as a lot of disjointed islands, shelves are arranged in the middle of the island to display all kinds of products.

The solution of the shelf space allocation is achieved by the mining of sales data. Firstly, according to the correlation between commodities, commodities are analyzed by the cluster technique; each of the commodity clusters can form a commodity island. Secondly, commodities of the island are arranged by promotions coefficients of the commodities.

Let I={il, i2, ... ,im} be set of items, and T C I be a transaction containing a set of items. A database D is a collection of transactions. Each transaction in D has a unique identifier, denoted by TID.

Based on the research of the sales data, a computational method of association distance between products is proposed.

Association distance is used to measure the strength of the relevance of two kinds of products.

Definition 1: Let D be a set of transaction T, A and B are two any items of set I, then the relevance between A and B can be described by association distance, denoted by RelDst(A,B).The smaller the value of RelDst(A,B), the stronger of the relevance between A and B.

RelDst(A,B)= 1-( count(AB)/Count(D)i; (1)    Where count(D) be the number of transactions in D, count(AB) be the number of transactions containing both A and B in Do  To measure the promotional strength of commodity A and B, a concept named promotions coefficient is introduced.

By association rule mining, the association rule like' A -B[S, c, Q, P]'can be attained. Where S is the support of the rule; C is the confidence of the rule; Q is the average purchase quantity; P is the gross profit of the commodity A. So, the expression Count(D) X S X C X Q X P can express the profit arising from the promotional impact from A to B. Before we display A and B together for cross-selling, we must consider the association rule 'A - B[S,C,Q,P]  , and 'B?  A[S' ,C' ,Q' ,P , ] , .So we introduce promotions coefficient,  denoted by W(A,B). The bigger the value of W(A,B), the more obvious the promotions impact between A and B.

Definition 2: The promotional ability between A and B can be described by promotions coefficient, denoted by W  (A-B) .

W(A,B) =SXCXQXP+ S'XC' XQ'XP' (2)

Firstly, we get all association rule like 'A?B[S,C,Q,P]' by Apriori algorithm.

Secondly, we compute promotions coefficient of any two commodities, and get their priorities by their promotions coefficient.

STEP3: Get the priority of every cluster STEP3.l: According to the transaction set, we will get  the commodity model with purchase count and average quantity. The result is shown in table XI.

STEP3.2: Accordmg to data of commodItIes and cluster, we can get the gross profit of every cluster. For example, the gross profit of cluster {A,B,C,D} is as follow: 6*(13/6)*0.2+6*(1116)*0.3+7*(917)*0.1 +2*2*0.1 =7.2  The result is shown in table XII.

The network diagram of cluster {A, B, C, D} is shown in figure 1.

According to optimization theory, in the network diagram, we can find many paths to connect all commodities; we choose the path which has the maximum value of?W. So, in the cluster {A, B, C, D} , we can find the priority order is D--B--A--C.

V. CONCLUSION  The optimization of shelf space allocation is a difficult problem and a very important area of research. Based on association rule mining and cluster analysis techniques, a two-step solution containing formation of clusters and layout of commodities in cluster is proposed in this paper. To measure the strength of promotions between two commodities, promotions coefficient is defined. With network diagram, a method of displaying commodities in commodity cluster is proposed.
