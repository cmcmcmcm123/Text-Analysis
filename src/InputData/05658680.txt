The Rapid Association Rules and Discovery of Tacit Knowledge Based on Star

Abstract-According to the shortcomings that data mining of the star schema structure is more complex, this paper planes a star schema structure, on base of these, an association rules mining algorithm is constructed. The algorithm first scans the fact table, produces maximum frequent set and association rules, and then the dimension table attributes are scanned quickly by link conditions and the local effectiveness principle of association rules, which of the dimension table is one-off production. The tacit knowledge is mined by constructing extended dimension table for the undefined association rules.

The mining speed of the algorithm is faster and the extended hidden information can be found in this way.)  Keywords-Star Schema; Association Rules; Tacit Knowledge;Data mining

I. INSTRUCTION  Data mining technology has obtained extensive research, application and development since its beginning, the research field is very extensive. But data mining is based on common table structure in data organizing form of research.

The star schema is an organization form of database, and is composed of two kinds of the basic table: a fact table and dimension tables. The fact table includes practical transactions or the analysis values wanted, and dimension tables include the description information related to these transactions and values. The star schema exists widely in database application system [10-11].

The star schema mining belongs to multidimensional data mining, and mining algorithm is too complicated because data dimension is larger. The mining research according to multidimensional data is relatively less at present, and mostly adopts the layered structure mining, and the dimension table uses different threshold, which the casualness is greater and can not suit mining [1-41.

In mining algorithm, FP _Tree and genetic algorithm etc are adopted mostly. However, the research for the classical Apriori algorithm is relatively less [5-9].

A new algorithm of association rules mining to the star schema structure is proposed in the paper, which does not need to go the consolidation of table and go directly and efficiently data mining in the star schema. Basis for the local principle, the fact table and dimension tables can use the same threshold to mine. Association rules of the fact table are produced, the dimension tables can be quickly produced,    Zhuang Li-yan College of Computer Science and Technology  Inner Mongolia University for Nationalities Tongliao China  zhuangliyan88@163.com  and can go the discovery of tacit knowledge by using heuristic method ..



II. THE STAR SCHEMA CONSTRUCTION  In order to go reasonably data mining, suggestions are as follows according to the star schema construction. The information included in the fact table should be enough, so ensuring the basic rules production. The dimension table represents the information description in a certain field of transaction. The fact table and the dimension table link through the primary key and foreign keys.

FI+-' PI+-' ---to F3+-'  - P1+-'  P3+-' r--  F2+-' fot- P?+-' F?+-'  Figure I. The structure diagram of the star schema  In figure, ( PI '  FI ) ( P2, F2) (P3, F3) and (P4, F4) link through the primary key and  foreign keys, and form the star schema.

Defined 1 The fact table is expressed as follows in the  star schema structure: Tm (PI ... Pn, RI, ... , Rm), and the maximum frequent set of Tm is expressed as: (PI ... Pn, MFIj) , in which Pi (i= 1, 2, ... ,n) is the ith key word of the primary key of the fact table, and MFIj is the jth maximum frequent set of the fact table. The dimension table T si is expressed as: Tsi ( F i,R. I , ... ,R.k) , and the attribute is expressed as: (Fi, Rj) , in where i is the jth attribute of the ith dimension table, and Fi corresponds to Pi of the fact table is foreign key of the ith dimension table.



III. ALGORITHM OF ASSOCIATION RULES MINING  Theorem 1 If the fact table exists the maximum frequent  set (PI ... Pn, MFIj ) , and the association rule A-+B is introduced, the frequency that the attribute Rj of the ith dimension table occured in the tuple Pi is equal to Fi in the dimension table and it is more than the minimum support Support, then the association rules A B-+Rj does exist.

Proved: The fact table exists the maximum frequent set (PI ... Pn, MFIj), and the association rule A---+B is introduced, then A C MFIj, Be MFIj, AnB=<l> and Rj ct. MFIj According to the connection table T m 1><1 Tsj (link: condition  is Pj= Fj) , the support of MFIj is 100%, and the support of Rj is more than minimum support Support, so the support of MFIjRj is more than Support, MFIjRj is the maximum frequent set.

support { MFIj ,RJ) = support {MFIjRJ) = support = 1 ? support  support { Rj } support { Rj } support  The confidence level of MFIjRj is 1, therefore, the association rule A B---+Rj is tenable, and theorem 1 is tenable.

Theorem 2 The local association rules produced by theorem are effective.

Proved: the proportion of a given population is [p%, q%] (it only is an estimation, the population does not always be certain beforehand) in a certain transaction database. The minimum support of frequent set is defined as c%, the range of segmentation support is [p%*c%, q%*c%]. The frequencies of k-set are in the range of [p%*c%, q%*c%], so the minimum support should be similar to the selection principle of Apriori algorithm.

c (A? B)= s(AUB)  = s(AUB)x c%  s(A) s(A)x c% Therefore, the rules produced by theorem 1 are effective.



IV. THE TACIT KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY  When the association rules produced by current mining database are not detailed enough mining, the extended dimension can be further constructed and mined, and the tacit knowledge is produced.

The fact table is added into the key word Pk, and increases an extended dimension (Fh RJ, R2, ??? ,Rn), and a link condition is constructed by using Pk and Fk? Data mining can be carried out by using the theory of theorem 1, and the tacit knowledge is obtained.



V. ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION  a) scans the fact table, and produces the association rule Scans the fact table, finds the maximum set (PI ... Pn,  MFIj), and produces the association rule A---+B.

b) scans the dimension table Scans all the dimension tables.

According to the link condition Pj= Fi, the ith dimension  table is scanned, and the occurrence number tj of the attribute  Rj is counted. if tj ? Support then the association rule AB---+ Rj is obtained.

The algorithm is realized based on the classical Apriori, the detailed description is omitted here.



VI. EXPERIMENTS  The fact table is mined locally according to the theorem 2.2, parts of achievements of 63 students which comes from the 2003th undergraduates of Computer Science in Inner Mongolia university for nationalities are mined, and the selection fields are (student number, mathematics, specialized course, English, sports, moral education, tendency).

The record distribution of tendency (postgraduate) and the scores of specialized course(good) is shown in Table I.

The result of the table has shown that the local population of "tendency (postgraduate)" exists the rule: "tendency (postgraduate)" ---+the scores of specialized course(good), because the support of data set< tendency (postgraduate) and the scores of specialized course(good? in local population is  min{86%, 100%,}=86%.

The mining result is shown in Figure5-1, which produced seven frequent sets, five the maximum frequent sets and an association rule: graduated tendency (postgraduate) ---+the scores of specialized course (good).

During the tacit knowledge mining, the primary key of  the fact table is "student number" and fields of the fact table are as follows:    (student number, Mathematics, specialized course, English, Sports, Moral education, tendency)  Constructing the dimension table of "student's information", the fields are as follows:  (student number, name, sex, age, region) Equality of "student number" is used as the link  condition, and the dimension table of "student's information" has five record of "sex=female", as shown in Table II.

VII. CONCLUSION  According to the shortcomings that data mining of the star schema structure is more complex, the star schema structure is constructed basis on the algorithm features.

Basing on these, an association rules mining algorithm is constructed, which can go the global and local data mining for database tables. The rapid mining algorithm is given for dimension tables of the star schema, and the tacit knowledge is mined by constructing extended dimension tables for the undefined association rules.

Tested by experiments, the algorithm is practical and effective.
