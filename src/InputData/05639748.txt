Abstract In data mining we not only mine the potential association between items, but also estimate the existent association of items which is still reasonable whether or not.

Association Rules is mainly used to find the useful knowledge of the items in the mass data. However with the time goes by or the environment changes, previous association rules between data items or initial rules might be not reasonable, so we should check these rules to find the unreasonable ones. An association rule can not find the unreasonable relation between the data items. In this paper, we regard the structure of rules found by association rules as a digraph, and propose the Pseudo-association Rules based on an association rule, which can find the unreasonable rules.

I. INTRODUCTION Data mining also known as knowledge discovery in  database is used to discover implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from data and it is an area including database, artificial intelligence, and machine learning [5].

Association rule [1] is proposed in 1993 at first by Agrawal, and it has received much more attention by now. An association rule is still used popularly for pattern discovery in KDD. It is used for mining the significant association rules between items in the trade database, which have reflected the behavior mode of the customers. An association rule can also be applied to design the catalog, add to sales, website's structure optimization, storage planning, network accident analysis etc. Now let?s consider the following problems: the first problem is, assume customers buy beers and also diapers.

However when the time goes by or the season changes, does this rule remain reasonable?  The second is when we design a web site, designers do it with their experience, and how can we estimate whether the web site is optimization. For these reasons, we present the concept of the Pseudo-association Rules (PAR) to solve the problem. The Pseudo-association Rules can find out whether the relations among the data are still reasonable which had been found by an association rule in the past. If this rule judged by Pseudo-association Rules is unreasonable, then get rid of this rule; otherwise, keep it.

A. Association Rules An association rule is the following statement [1]:  Let I=I1,  I2, ?, Im be a set of items. Given a database D of transactions, where each transaction t is represented as a set of items, with t[k] = 1 if t bought the item Ik, and t[k] = 0 otherwise. Let X be a set of some items in I. We say that a transaction t satisfies X if for all items Ik in X, t[k] = 1.

In brief, we view an association rule as an implication of the form X ?  Ij, where X is a set of some items in I, and Ij is a single item in I that is not present in X. The rule X? Ij is satisfied in the set of transactions T with the confidence factor 0 ? c ? 1 if at least c% of transactions in T that satisfy X also satisfy Ij. We will use the notation X? Ij | c to specify that the rule X ?  Ij has a confidence factor of c.

Given a set of transactions D, the problem of mining association rules is to generate all association rules that have support and confidence greater than the user-specified minimum support (called minsup) and minimum confidence ( called minconf ) respectively. Our discussion is neutral with respect to the representation of D. For example, D could be a data file, a relational table, or the result of a relational expression.

We define the support(X) as follows:  || )(  D XSupport x?=  (1)  Here, x?  is represent the number of the set of items in which X is included, |D| is amount of D.

And we define the Confidence as follows:  )(sup )(sup)(  Xport YXportYXConfidenc ?=?  (2)  Here, X ? Y is the union of itemset X and Y.

B. Outline of the paper In this paper, we view all the rules and items as a digraph  and describe the principle of the Pseudo-association rules. We do the experiment with them to analyze the structure of the web site of Jiangxi University of Science and Technology. The Pseudo-association rules can find the unreasonable hyperlink of web site and then to optimize the structure of web site.

The organization of the rest of the paper is as follows: In Section 2 we present the basic principle of pseudo-association rules. In Section 3, we introduce the Pseudo-association Rules algorithm. In Section 4, we do the experiment with Pseudo- association rules to show the effectiveness of it. In Section 5, we conclude with a summary and the future work.



II. BASIC PRINCIPLE OF PSEUDO-ASSOCIATION RULES We propose the digraph to represent the rules between  items in which edge is a rule and vertex is items. The Pseudo- association Rules scan the database to examine whether the edge (rule) is reasonable, and make structure of graph more rational. A lot of disciplines have something to do with digraph, so it is essential to optimize the digraph. The prerequisite in the Pseudo-association Rules is that the relations among the itemset are definite. In the data mining, we can utilize the Pseudo-association Rules to find the irrationality of the relation between the items, thus we reach the optimization of the data.

We call it the Pseudo-association Rules, just because in the target objects (database, website, etc.), we have given a certain relation between the elements, but the existence of this kind of relation is unreasonable. The Pseudo-association rules algorithm will recognize this kind of unreasonable or untrue relation. Since this relation is unreasonable, then we call it Pseudo-association rules. Because of property of the Pseudo- association rules, we can use it to optimize the graph.

A. The Digraph Structure of Database We consider that association rules are regarded to find out  potential edges of the digraph, while the pseudo-association rules is to find out the unreasonable edges of the graph. That is to say, we can use the directed graph to represent the items as vertexes and view the edges as the relation between the items.

Now we give the definition of the graph as follows [3]:  A graph (or undirected graph) G consists of a set V of vertices (or nodes) and a set E of edges (or arcs) such that each edge e ?E is associated with an unordered pair of vertices. If there is a unique edge e associated with the vertices v and w, we write e = (v, w) or e = (w, v). In this context, (v, w) denotes an edge between v and w in an undirected graph and not an ordered pair.

A directed graph (or digraph) G consists of a set V of vertices (or nodes) and a set E of edges (or arcs) such that each edge e ?  E is associated with an ordered pair of vertices. If there is a unique edge e associated with the ordered pair (v, w) of vertices, we write e = (v, w), which denotes an edge from v to w.

An edge e in a graph (undirected or directed) that is associated with the pair of vertices v and w is said to be incident on v and w, and v and w are said to be incident on e and to be adjacent vertices.

If G is a graph (undirected or directed) with vertices V and edges E, we is assumed to be nonempty.

S  Z  W  D F  H  N  R Y  Q   Fig. 1. The graph model  Figure 1 is a graph G consisting of the set V = {S, D, F, Z, Q, H, R, Y, W, N} of vertices and the set E = {e1, e2,?, e12} of edges. Edge e1 is associated with the pair {S, D} of vertices, and edge e5 is associated with the pair {F, H} of vertices. Edge e1 is denoted (S, D) or (D, S), and edge e5 is denoted (F, H) or (H, F).

B. The Pseudo-association Rules Let G = {V, E} be a digraph composed by rules and items.

Let I = {x1, ? ,xn} be a set of distinct literals, called items. A V is a set of items and its element Vj ?  I with k = |Vj| is called a k-itemset (A k-itemset is an itemset with k items) or simply an itemset. E is a set of rules of items. Let a database D be a multi- set of subsets of I. We say that an association rule is an expression X ? Y, where X, Y(X, Y ? V) are itemsets and X ? Y = ?  holds and X? Y ?E.

In pseudo-association rules, we evaluate each of relation X? Y in set of E, which is reasonable whether or not. We use the notation X ? >Y to represent the relation of items between X and Y as the unreasonable relation in the set of E, if the relation X ?Y is not reasonable. We make the relation (edge) X ? Y as X ? >Y in the set of E, if the support or the confidence of X ? Y is lower than the certain threshold support and confidence. Here, we define the threshold of support called maxsupport, and the threshold of confidence called maxconfidence.

We think that the meaning of the support and confidence in the pseudo-association rules is same as that in the association rule. Confidence is a measure of the rule?s strength, supports to statistical significance [1].

Here, the threshold of maxconfidence is lower than min- confidence. If the value of confidence is between maxconfidence and min-confidence, we think that the rule is not strong enough but it does not mean the rule could be a pseudo-association rule.

Consider a supermarket, for example, assuming that we have found the association between ?sausage? and ?mustard? by association rules, now we re-calculate the support and confidence of the association. If they are lower than the threshold of minsupport and maxsuspicion respectively, we should change the location of ?sausage? and ?mustard? on sale, and analyses what cause the association disappearing.

As the pseudo-association rules, it may include following respects:  ? The support is greater than the maxsupport while confidence is lower than the maxconfidence.

? The support is lower than the maxsupport while maxconfidence is greater than the maxsuspicion.

? Both the support and the confidence are lower than the maxsupport and maxconfidence respectively.



III. PSEUDO-ASSOCIATION RULES ALGORITHM In the pseudo-association rules, we have known the  association among the items at the beginning, and then we calculate the support and the confidence of the association of items. So we can regard the pseudo-association rules algorithm as a reverse procedure against an association rule algorithm such as Apriori or AprioriTid [2].

A. An Apriori algorithm In an Apriori algorithm, we can decompose the problem of  the rule mining into two subproblems [1]:  ? Find all sets of items (itemsets) that have transaction support above minimum support. The support for an itemset is the number of transactions that contain the itemset. Itemsets with minimum support are called large itemsets, and all others small itemsets.

? Use the large itemsets to generate the desired rules. Here is a straightforward algorithm for this task. For every such subset a, output a rule of the form a? (l ? a) if the ratio of support(l) to support(a) is at least minconf. We need to consider all subsets of l to generate rules with multiple consequents.

Let Lk be the set of large k-itemsets. For example, L3 might contain {{A, B, C}, {A, B, D}, {A, D, F},?}. Let Ck be the set of candidate k-itemsets; this is always a superset of Lk. Here is the Apriori algorithm [2]:  L1 = {large 1-itemsets};  For(k=2;Lk-1 ? ? ;k++)do begin Ck=apriori-gen(Lk-1);  Forall transactions t?D do begin Ct=subset(Ck,t);  Forall candidates c?Ct do c.count++;  end  Lk={c?Ck|c.count ? minsup} End  Answer = ? kLk;  B. A Pseudo-association Rules In the Pseudo-association Rules, we can roughly consider  the pseudo-association rule is converse one against an association rule.

?  1 Find out the structure that consist of the known association rules and the initial structure, and represent it as a graph G (V, E), in which V represents the itemset and E represents relations between items.

?  2 Calculating the support and confidence of association rule v(X, Y)?  V, where X, Y are the antecedent and consequent of the rule respectively, for the known association rules, we compare the support and confidence with maxsupport and maxconfidence respectively, then judging the existence of the relation.

The pseudo-association rule algorithm is described as follows:  Forall association rules v(X, Y) ?V do begins

X.count =0;  forall transactions t?D do begins If (x? t) then

X.count++;  If ((X? Y) ? t) then  (X? Y). count++;  end  sup = (X? Y).count/D.count;  conf = (X? Y).count/X.count;  If (sup<maxsup or conf<maxconf) then //D.count is the  // total number of transaction  // in the database  X ?> Y  end  C.  Example To illustrate the principle of the Pseudo-association rule, we  consider an example database in Fig.2, in which we had already found the association between item {A} and {B} before. Now we verify whether this association is still exist.

We set the maxsupport 0.2 and maxconfidence 0.4. First, we calculate the support 1-itemset shown in (2), the itemset {A} is 3. Second, we get the support of 2-itemsets and {A, B} is 1, and then the confidence of 2-itemset is 1/3, which is lower than the maxconfidence.

TID Items   Itemset   Support        A  C  D  A  C  E  A  B  C  E  B  E  {A}  {B}  {C}  {D}  {E}       ?1? Database                       ?2?1-Itemset  Itemset    Support Itemset    Confidence  {A  B}  {A  C}  {A  E}  {B  C}  {B  E}  {C  E}        {A  B}  {A  C}  {A  E}  {B  C}  {B  E}  {C  E}  1/3   2/3  1/2   2/3  ?3?2-Itemset                              ?4?Confidence  Fig. 2.   An example of database  Just as the example has shown us that the association rule between items {A} and {B} is lower than the maxconfidence.

Therefore, we can make a conclusion that the rule we have got before is not suitable any longer.



IV. EXPERIMENTS In this paper, we make an experiment with the pseudo-  association rules to optimize the structure of the web site.

As we know, designing a web site is a complex task [4]; we may use the pseudo-association rule to estimate the validity of the web site which is one of applications of pseudo-association rule. Now we take an experiment to evaluate the structure of one website by pseudo-association rules. Website designers must structure and present their content in a way that is clear and intuitive to users, or those users will become lost and disgruntled. Visitors to a site do not always have the same conceptual model of the material as the site?s designer.

We regard hyperlinks between the pages of the web site as the rules and the pages as items. We experimented with the pseudo-association rule algorithm by using the web log data from Jiangxi University of Science and Technology. Web servers register a web log entry for every single access they get, recording important pieces of information: the URL requested, the IP address from which the request originated and a timestamp. A log entry is automatically added each time that a request for a resource reaches the Web Server (see Figure 3).

Fig. 3. Fragment of a web log file from Website of Jiangxi  University of Science and Technology  The experiments were performed on a Dell PrecisionTM Workstation 370 clocked at 3.6 GHz.

First, we scan the primitive hyperlink of the structure of the website, and analyze the hyperlink structure between the web pages of its website with the Pseudo-association Rules, and analyze that the log recorder of this website. We define the threshold maxsupport 0.1 and the maxconfidence 0.2. The pseudo-association rules is written in the form X ??Y|(c, s).

Here, we list several experimental results. The results are as follows:  1.   [kuandai2.htm] ? >and [thailand.htm] (0.02, 0.05).

2.   [dep_sel.htm] ? > [first.htm] (0.1, 0.93).

3.   [kuandai.htm] ? > [xgxx.htm] (0.01, 0.96).

4.   [bg_xp.htm] ? > [05fszl.htm] (0.02, 0.40).

In pseudo-association rule algorithm, every association rule which would be evaluated will be measured in one pass.

Compare to the association rule, the pseudo-association rule has less time complexity.

To estimate the accuracy of the pseudo-association rules about the support and confidence, first we use Apriori algorithm to calculate the support and confidence and compare them got by the pseudo-association rules on the same log recorder database. We found that the result of the pseudo- association rules is the same as it of the association rules. So we conclude that the pseudo-association rules can do the work well.



V. SUMMARIZATION AND THE FUTURE WORK In this paper, we present pseudo-association rules based on  the association rules, which is used to mine the un-reasonable relations between the data. Just like the association rule, we set two threshold factors, maxsupport and maxconfidence. If the support or confidence of the items is lower than the threshold of maxsupport or the maxconfidence respectively, we can tell that rule of these items is a pseudo-association rule.

We discussed the algorithm of pseudo-association rules and use it to analyze the web structure of the Jiangxi University of Science and Technology.

For the goods in the selling, the relation of commodity item is likely to change with the season and the different location of the shops. This kind of change occurs as well in the commodity dealing store. We should mine this change out through pseudo- association rules so as to provide information for decision-     making of decision-maker. In optimizing the website, PAR can find out the web of being clicked or less clicked by customer in the hyperlink of the webs. Therefore, these hyperlinks can be rid of or modified to perfect the website.

We do not yet consider another factor ?  interest measure[6,7,8,9,10] in our paper, we will consider it in next research.
