Abstract? Detection of outliers and relevant features are the most important process before classification. In this paper, a novel semi-supervised k-means clustering is proposed for outlier detection in mammogram classification. Initially the shape features are extracted from the digital mammograms, and k-means clustering is applied to cluster the features, the number of clusters is equal with the number of classes.  The clusters are compared with original classes, the wrongly clustered instances are identified as outliers and they are removed from the feature space. A novel Genetic Association Rule Miner (GARM) is applied with this reduced feature set to construct the association rules for classification. The performance is analyzed with rough set using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The mammogram images from MIAS (Mammogram Image Analysis Society) and DDSM (Digital Database for Screening Mammography) were used to evaluate the performance.

I.  INTRODUCTION Mammography is currently the most effective imaging  modality for breast cancer screening. Computer Aided (CA) diagnosis systems have been developed to aid radiologists in detecting mammographic lesions, characterized by promising performance [1].  Various CA diagnosis algorithms have been proposed for the characterization of microcalcifications (MCs), an important indicator of malignancy [2-4]. These algorithms are based on extracting image features from regions of interest (ROIs) and estimating the probability of malignancy for a given MC cluster. A variety of computer-extracted features and classification schemes have been used to automatically discriminate between benign and malignant MC clusters. The majority of these studies have followed two approaches. The first approach is based on computer extracted morphology/shape features of individual MCs or of MC clusters [5-9], since morphology is one of the most important clinical factors in breast cancer diagnosis. CAD schemes that employ the radiologists? ratings of MCs morphology have also been proposed [10-11]. The second approach employs texture features extracted from ROIs containing MC clusters [12-16].

Some studies have compared morphological vs. textural features but the results are differentiated with respect to the  features investigated, the classifiers used and datasets analyzed.

A combination of both morphological and textural features has also been studied, providing promising results in breast cancer diagnosis [7, 16]. In this paper we have considered only the shape features. One of the most important steps for the classification task is extracting suitable features capable of distinguishing between classes. There have been great efforts spent on extracting appropriate features from micro calcification clusters [17, 18]. In order to reduce the complexity and to increase the performance of the classifier the redundant and irrelevant features are reduced from the original feature set.

Rough set theory, proposed by Pawlak [19, 20], has been proven to be an effective tool for feature selection, rule extraction and knowledge discovery from categorical data in recent years. In this paper, a novel semi-supervised k-means clustering is implemented to detect the irrelevant instances.

Initially the mammogram images are preprocessed for removing film artifacts, noises and the suspicious regions are segmented from the enhanced image and the shape features are extracted from the segmented region. From this feature set the outliers are identified and removed with semi-supervised k- means clustering. These reduced feature set is fed to Genetic Association Rule Miner (GARM) to construct the classification rules [4]. The performance of our proposed dimensionality reduction method is analyzed with the Rough set approaches QuickReduct [19] and Fuzzy-QuickReduct [20] using Receiver Operating Character (ROC) curve analysis.

The rest of the paper is organized as: the following section presents the preprocessing, segmentation and feature extraction steps. The proposed semi-supervised k-means clustering for dimensionality reduction phase is explained in section 3. The experiments and results are discussed in Section 4. And the work is concluded in Section 5.



II. PREPROCESSING, SEGMENTATION AND FEATURE EXTRACTION  Since real-life data is often incomplete, noisy and inconsistent, pre-processing becomes a necessity one.

Preprocessing is the process of cleaning the data by removing noise, outliers etc. that could mislead the actual mining process.

In this work, at first, the digital mammograms are converted from grayscale to binary. The binary image will contain lots of white regions like x-ray labels, other notes and the breast profile. Normally, the breast region will have more        TABLE I.  FEATURE RELATED TO THE SHAPE AND APPEARANCE OF MICROCALCIFICATIONS  1 Number of microcalcifications in the cluster  2 Maximum size of calcifications in cluster  3 Standard deviation of the size of calcifications in cluster  4 Number of calcifications with size of 1 pixel  5 Sum of the area of the calcifications in each cluster  6 Maximum value of compactness in cluster  7 Average compactness in cluster  8 Maximum value of F3?F1 in cluster  9 Average F3?F1 in cluster  10 Maximum value of F3 in cluster  11 Average F3 in cluster  12 Radius of the circle that best fits the cluster  13 Scattering of the microcalcifications  14 Average gray level of the microcalcifications in cluster  15 Standard deviation of the mean of the microcalcification gray levels  16 Maximum standard deviation of the gray levels in each calcification 17 Average standard deviation in each calcification in cluster    number of pixels than the other. Based on this idea, the cluster having highest number of pixels is considered as breast region and the remaining pixels in the grayscale images are converted down to zero. Then the median filter is applied to remove the noise from the mammograms. And to improve the contrast, histogram equalization is applied.

Before extracting the shape features, microcalcifications should be segmented from the background of the mammographic images. The segmentation process [3] generates an image in which microcalcifications of different sizes are seen with the background texture omitted. These images are used in the next steps for extracting the shape features. The MCs are labeled in the segmented images for feature extraction. At the end of labeling, every microcalcification is assigned a label that is used for identifying it in a cluster and for further processing. The largest label represents the number of microcalcifications in the cluster. One set of shape features of the microcalcifications and their clusters are used for classification given by [16].  This set contains totally 17 features as listed in Table I.



III. OUTLIER DETECTION USING SEMI-SUPERVISED K- MEANS CLUSTERING  The shape features extracted for the digital mammograms are normalized and stored, in which, each columns represents one feature (attribute) and the last column represents the class attribute. And each tuple is for one image. In this paper, the outliers are removed using semi-supervised k-means clustering.

The k-means clustering is unsupervised in nature, but in this paper, the k-means clustering is combined with the decision attribute for outlier detection, so it is been named as semi- supervised k-means clustering.

One of the most popular clustering techniques is the k-  means clustering algorithm. Starting from a random partitioning, the algorithm repeatedly (i) computes the current cluster centers (i.e. the average vector of each cluster in data space) and (ii) reassigns each data item to the cluster whose centre is closest to it. It terminates when no more reassignments take place. By this means, the intra-cluster variance, that is, the sum of squares of the differences between data items and their associated cluster centers is locally minimized. k -means? strength is its runtime, which is linear in the number of data elements, and its ease of implementation.

However, the algorithm tends to get stuck in suboptimal solutions (dependent on the initial partitioning and the data ordering) and it works well only for spherically shaped clusters. It requires the number of clusters to be provided or to be determined (semi-) automatically. In our experiments, the cluster number is kept equal to the number of classes.

1. Choose a number of clusters k 2. Initialize cluster centers ?1,? ?k  a. Could pick k data points and set cluster centers to these points  b. Or could randomly assign points to clusters and take means of clusters  3. For each data point, compute the cluster center it is closest to (using some distance measure) and assign the data point to this cluster.

4. Re-compute cluster centers (mean of data points in cluster)  5. Stop when there are no new re-assignments.

Here the k-means clustering is applied to the feature set by  specifying the k value equal to number of classes. As given in the results section, the mammogram images are classified based on the mass type, lesion size and breast tissue type.

According to each category the feature set is clustered. After clustering, the clusters are compared with original classes, the instances in the wrong cluster are considered as outliers and they are removed from the feature set. Then QuickReduct (QR) and Fuzzy-QuickReduct (FQR) are applied with this enhanced feature set to construct the reduced feature set [19,20]. With these reduced features set the classification is performed using GARM as described in [4].



IV. EXPERIMENTS & RESULTS The digital mammograms used in our experiments were  taken from the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) and Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM). The MIAS database consists of 322 images, which belong to three categories: normal, benign and malign (ftp://peipa.essex.ac.uk).

There are 208 normal images, 69 benign and 51 malign, which are considered abnormal. The 120 abnormal images (69 benign and 51 malign) are used in the experiments. These 120 images are further reduced to 108 images after applying k- means based outlier detection. And these images are categorized based on tissue type and mass type as given in the Table II. Table III, IV and V shows the reduced feature subset for each class based on: mass type, tissue type and lesion size.

The performance of our proposed method is compared with QuickReduct (QR) and Fuzzy-QuickReduct (FQR).

The performance of the proposed method is analyzed with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. A ROC curve is a graph between the True Positive (TP) rates (sensitivity) as a function of the False Positive (FP) rate (1-specificity). When the accuracy increased, the ROC curve covers most of the area in the graph, represents a higher sensitivity corresponds to a lower false positive rate. The area under the curve, Az value is measured to indicate the overall performance of the algorithm. For an ideal classifier the Az value is equal to one, or as a percentage equal to 100. A ten-fold cross validation method is performed to analyze the performance of the segmentation method with ROC curve. Figure 1 shows the ROC curve from our proposed method and the existing rough set methods. The proposed k- means clustering and QR method has the better accuracy of 91% (the Az value). Table VI shows the overall accuracy between the previous works and the proposed method.

The mass type has a strong influence on the performance of the segmentation algorithms. Table VII shows the Az values of segmentation for each type of masses. Compared to all the cases Circumscribed masses have more accurate detection rate than the other type of masses.

The influence of the lesion size on the segmentation algorithm is presented in Table IX, from the results it is clearly shown that the size of the lesions are directly proportional with the detection accuracy. When the size of lesion increases the detection rate also increases.

The algorithm was also tested with the mammogram images from DDSM database (marathon.csee.usf.edu), which contains 1792 images, in which 256 depicted a true mass and 1536 were normal. Table X shows the prediction accuracy based on ROC analysis. The greater accuracy (AZ=0.89) shows the better performance of our proposed method.

V. CONCLUSION Reducing redundant or irrelevant features can improve  classification performance in most of cases and decrease cost of classification. In this paper a novel semi-supervised k-means clustering have been proposed for dimensionality reduction in mammogram classification. Initially the mammogram images are preprocessed and the suspicious regions are segmented.

The shape features are extracted from these segmented regions.

The outliers are detected and removed from the feature set using semi-supervised k-means. Then the rough set approach is                      applied to construct the reduced feature set. The classification is performed with Genetic Association Rule Miner (GARM).

Two mammogram images datasets: MIAS and DDSM mammogram images were used to study the performance of our proposed method. The performance is compared with standard QuickReduct and Fuzzy QuickReduct, with ROC analysis. The higher Az value of 0.91(MIAS) and 0.89 (DDSM) states the importance of outlier detection as well as proves the better performance of the proposed semi-supervised k-means clustering approach for outlier detection.
