Network Analysis and Rule Mining of Export Market

Abstract-Networks are well-suited model for representing  complex systems and processes. This paper proposed a novel  perspective on study of the evolvement of export market  structure by combining network-based approach with data  mining technology. Firstly, bipartite networks were constructed  to describe the relationships that form between enterprises and  their export markets based on China's Guangdong custom  statistical data for the 2000-2005 periods. Network analysis  techniques were used to analyze and describe the topology  properties of the whole networks as well as their evolution over  time. Secondly, data mining techniques were used to identify  most frequent association relations and evolvement rule hidden  in bipartite networks.

I. INTRODUTION  Exporting is the simplest mode of internationalizing a  domestic business and the most common form of international  business activity, comparing with other modes of entry, for  instance licensing, franchising, management contract and  foreign direct investment (FDI) [1]. A fInn or enterprise does  not have to be the size of these multinational giants to facilitate,  and benefIt from, the globalization of markets, either via  exports or international production [2].

Expansion into new markets, for business enterprises or  fIrm, has two benefIts: First, a fIrm may be able to achieve  economies of scale, lowering its average costs as its production  increases. Second, such expansion diversities a fInn's revenue  steam. As it serves more countries, the fInn becomes less  dependent on its sales in any one country; thereby protecting  itself should that country's economy tum sour. So seeking new  foreign markets is a common motive for international  expansion of enterprise, and also is the main export-oriented    Jianmei Yang2  2School of Business Administration  South China University of Technology, SCUT  Guangzhou, 510641, China.

Complex network theory, originated in research on  complex systems in physics and computer science, has proved  to be effective in understanding many different phenomena,  drawn from technological, biological and social world. In the  language of networks, bipartite network can be extracted from  the international trade activity, where enterprises representing  one of type node (actors or economic agents), foreign markets  (countries) representing other type node. The edges represent  trade tie between business enterprise and export market. In this  way, the export trade system can be examined under a  topological point of view. The analysis results will reveal  complex properties that cannot be explained by conventional  established trade statistical methods.

Although there is nowadays a signifIcant amount of  powerful tools to analyses one-mode networks, special network  techniques for large bipartite network or two-mode network are  very complicated and limited. So the solution commonly used  is to change or project the two-mode network into a one-mode  network, which can be analyzed with standard techniques. For  example, the actor-movies network is transformed into actor  collaboration network where two actors are linked of they acted  together in a movies [3]; the company board networks are  transformed into company interlock network where two  persons are linked together if they are member of a same board  [4].

However more and more researchers realize that the  projection may lead to lose much important information and  cause other problems [5]. For example, some properties of the    network may be due to the projection process rather than the  underlying data itself (e.g. one observes high clustering  coefficients). Therefore considering the bipartite statistics  brings significant information as compared to the projections.

But another problem is that, considering the complexity in  the real world network, only studying mathematically topology  statistics using existing network analysis tools cannot discover  hidden rules or intrinsically structured patterns in complex  network. New methodology or method needs to be developed.

Data mining as a novel technique of discovering the hidden  pattern and link in complex social network or graph is  interesting research or application field. [6] [7] [8]  This study attempts to combine complex network modeling  and analysis approach with data mining technique, for the  purpose of providing a new insight to understand the system's  dynamics, observable on the aggregate level, and how they can  be trance back to the structural properties, and link pattern or  rules hidden in network.



II.  NETWORK MODELING & ANALYSIS  A. Research Background  Guangdong is the largest foreign trade province in China.

In 2007, the export of Guangdong reached US$369.25 billion,  accounting for 30.3% of the national total, had consecutively  kept frrst rank in the past two decades. Guangdong's economic  achievement is largely attributed to the adoption of export  -oriented industrialization as the region's main development  strategy. According to Guangdong custom statistical data, only  354 private enterprises export their products to 138 countries in  2000, but in 2007, the number of export private enterprises  more than 17324, export countries covered global region. The  reason for rapid growth is that the government departments  have adopted a serial measures to boosting the development of  import-export private enterprises:  ? Lower the qualifications for private production  enterprises to engage in import-export business, all  private enterprises capable of producing export  products may apply for import-export rights in 1999.

? Simplify approval procedures. Foreign trade, industry  and commerce, customs, foreign exchange  administration and state taxation departments, as well   as banks and inspection and quarantine authorities  undertake to complete formalities for the approval of  import-export rights for qualified private production  enterprises within one working day.

? Ease restrictions on registered capital by allowing  newly-established private enterprises to pay up their  registered capital by installment.

? Encourage private enterprises to open up international  markets. For five years starting from 2003, the  provincial government will allocate Rmb25 million  each year to an export-oriented private enterprises  development fund to assist these enterprises in  expanding the international market.

? Expedite tax rebate for private enterprises.

? Simplify credit approval and relax loan terms.

Changes in trade policy result in a significant growth in the  number of private enterprise which started internationalizing  through export. Total export of private enterprises has become  the new growth targets for Guangdong's exports. However due  to impact of global financial crisis, export orders of private  enterprises (especially among its major export markets-the  United States, the EU, and Japan) started to drop since the first  quarter in 2008 and the annual growth rate of export has  dropped to 8% from 29.9% in 2007.

Obviously international trade goes beyond the fundamental  exchange of goods and services; it can also be the channel for  crises spreading [9]. The complexity of dynamic interaction  among a large number of different agents, the resulting system  behavior had been proven difficult to predict and control. So  we need a new and a more fundamental insight into the  system's dynamics and how they can be traced back to the  structural properties. Therefore, network-based approaches  may provide a more powerful way to manage, monitor, and  govern complex economics systems [10].

B. Bipartite Network Modeling  Bipartite network as a model tool was widely recognized  because many networks in real world display a natural bipartite  structure [11]. From this point of view, we assume EMN =  (Enterprise, Market, Arcs) is the bipartite enterprise-market    network, which is direct and weighted network. Let m and n be  the number of markets and enterprises respectively. The  volume of the trade flow from i-th "enterprise" node to j-th  "market" node is the link weight. We constructed 6 bipartite  networks, each network corresponding to a trade year (from  2000 to 2005).

TABLE!. BASIC STATISTICS ON EMN IN 2000-2005  Statistics 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005  Total number of markets 138 163 192 208 214 222  Total number of enterprises 354 1133 2571 4706 8395 11203  Trade Links 3597 10723 28221 58909 92708 144082  Density of network 0.074 0.058 0.057 0.060 0.052 0.058  Out -degree( enterprise) :mean 10.19 9.46 10.98 12.52 11.04 12.86  Out -degree( enterprise): median 5 4 4 6 6 6  Out-degree (enterprise):st.dev. 12.43 13.32 13.54 15.2 13.93 16.24  Out -degree( enterprise): max 62 95 92 104 138 135  Out -degree( enterprise): min 1(21%) 1(25%) 1(23%) 1(19%) 1(20%) 1(20%)  In-degree( market): mean 26.07 65.79 146.98 283.22 433.21 649.02  In-degree( market): median 11 24.5 43 82 123.5 197  In-degree (market):st.dev. 38.33 106.28 260.59 496.52 784.08 1124.09  In-degree( market): max 267 829  In-degree( market): min 1(16%) 1(9010)  C. Node Degree and Degree Distribution  A first way to describable network statistics is to count the  number of links maintained by each node: this measure is  referred to as node in-degree and out-degree. In our study,  out-degree, for each enterprise, measures the number of its  foreign markets, which representing result of  internationalization process. In-degree, for each market,  measures the number of private enterprises (exporting their  products to the market). Table I reports summary statistics for  EMN and nodes.

Although the number of nodes, in particular the number of  enterprise, has significantly increased over time, network  density reduced from 0.074 to 0.058. This means that trade  relationships have grown slower than size of network, i.e.

seeking new markets is not an easy job for most private  enterprises. The growing slowly average degree (from 10.19 to  12.86) and median values (4-----6) of enterprise node over time  confmns the result for network density. About 20% of the  nodes have degree one. This also states that one-fifth of the  enterprises only have a single foreign market, which is first   1909 3586 6121 8023  1(5%) 1(2%) 1(2%) 1(2%)  step of internationalization, i.e. foreign market entry is a  gradual process.

Figure I. (a) Distribution of out-degree;  (b) Cumulative distribution of in-degree  Figure l.a shows that out degree distributions are very  heterogeneous and well fitted by power laws because the plot is  a straight line of negative slope in log-log scales. The  exponents, as a measure of the heterogeneity of the  distribution, are about 2-----3 (2.08, 2.42, 2.53, 2.66, 2.89 and  2.77 respectively in 2000-2005). These imply there are  significant differences in strategy and ability of exploiting  international market for different enterprises. For example, the  maximum value of out-degree increased from 62 to 135 during  5 years.

For "market" node, the average value of in-degree  significantly increased from 26.07 to 649.02. This states that a  serial of export -oriented industrialization policy arouse the  enthusiasm of exploiting foreign market for private enterprises.

The average value and the maximum value of in-degree remain  higher than the median in all years. This implies that most  markets are far from been exploited (e.g. countries in Africa),  but some typically have numerous entrants.

Figure l.b shows the cumulative distribution of in-degree.

Although the shape of the distribution is not well fitted by a  power law, shows heavy tailed. The exponents decreased from  1.8 to 1.4 in the 2000-2005 periods, where lower exponents  reveal higher heterogeneity. Observed value of in-degree spans  several orders of magnitudes (from 1 to more than 8,000).

Moreover, there are always two special data points in tail  (Hong Kong and America respectively) far away from other  data points. In such cases, the average value brings little  information: it not the value observed on most objects, and a  randomly chosen object may exhibit a very different value.

Therefore, characterizing the heterogeneity of the distribution  is more meaningful.

D. Node Strength and Strength Distribution  The strength of a node, integrating the information both  with its connectivity and the importance of the weights of its  links, is a very significant measure of the network properties.

In our study, export size per enterprise represents the  out-strength of "enterprise" node, which is the sum of link  weight of flow out. Export share per market can be defmed as  the in-strength of "market" node, which is the sum of link  weight of flow in.

The strength distributions are given in Figure 2. The shape  of log-log distributions are more suitable exponent rather than a  power law in two cases. For enterprise nodes, the size of export  has a power-law distribution for large size enterprises whose  strength greater than 107 dollars. The phenomenon, Pareto-Zipf  law (exponent equal 1) holds for firm size x larger than  observational threshold xO, also can be observed on many  empirical studies of firm dynamic, where firm size can be  profit, sale amount, states of company, the numbers of  employee.

I tlteOltJpol1  Figure 2. (a) Distribution of out-strength  (b) Cumulative distribution of in-strength  The mean value of in-strength has significantly increased  between 2000 and 2005. But the difference between mean  value and median value becomes bigger and bigger. This  means the distribution of market share is highly skewed to the  right. The growing maximum values over time confirm  asymmetry in export share. For example, in 2005 dataset, Hong  Kong is the largest export market for Guangdong's private  enterprise, 8023 (71.6%) enterprises export products to Hong  Kong, account for 29.1 % of total export. The second is  America market. Nearly 55% enterprise export to America,  contributing 18.5% of total export. The shapes of the  cumulative distribution of in-strength are very similar in all of  year. These imply the similarity of foreign market structure:  although enterprise's export market have expanded to globe  region, but centralized a few trade partners or countries.



III. RULE MINING & LINK ANALYSIS  A. Market Association Rule Mining  Association Rules Mining (ARM) has been introduced in  the context of Market Business Analysis. Input data are  composed of transactions: each transaction consists of items  purchased by a consumer during a single visit. Output data are  composed of rules. For example, a rule can be "90% of  transactions that involve the purchase of bread and butter also  include milk". [12]  An association rule is of the form X7Y (support,  confidence), where the support is the percentage of records in  datasets containing X and Y (or simply the joint probability  p(Xny)), the confidence is the percentage of records in  datasets containing X that also contain Y (or can be written  as the conditional probability P(YIX)). Support is used to  evaluate the statistical importance of the rule. The measure    confidence is used to evaluate the level of confidence about the  association rules X7Y. In order to reduce the possible biases  incurred when using measure standards, the simplest way is to  use the lift judgment. Lift is defined as: Lift =  Confidence(X 7 Y)/Support(Y). If lift value is equal to 1, then  X and Y are independent and there is no correlation between  them. If lift value is less than 1, then the occurrence of X is  negatively correlated with the occurrence of B. If lift value is  greater than 1, then X and Y has positively correlated, meaning  that the occurrence of one implies occurrence of the other.

From the point of view of data mining, a network is a  heterogeneous and multi-relational data set represented by a  mathematical matrix or graph. In our case, we consider  two-mode data as transaction data: each transaction consists of  all foreign markets of an enterprise during one year. In this  way, ARM can be used to search for frequent co-occurrence  market association pattern, and also discover interesting  bi-clique in bipartite graph. [13]  This study uses the Apriori algorithm, the minimum  support and minimum confidence of the association rules are  set to 25% and 50% respectively, and the lift of a rule is greater  than 1. Table II and Table III reports mining result for 2000  and 2005 two time point.

This means that more 40  percent enterprises choose USA and Hong Kong as common  export markets. If from the view of bipartite network, (USA,  Hong Kong) is the common neighbors of maximal bi-clique.

U.S.A7Hong Kong (support=44.8%, confidence=8l.5%)  Other markets associating strongly with Hong Kong  include: Japan, U.K., Germany, Australia, Canada, Singapore,  and Italy ecL This can further explain the tight economic and    trade relationship between Hong Kong and Guangdong. The  reasons are: from mid-1980s, Guangdong is a major  export-processing base for foreign investors, because of Hong  Kong's dominant share of total FDI, Hong Kong gradually  become the hub of the South China Economic Zone and  "middle man" as re-exports to the developed countries.

B. Web-link Analysis  Web-link analysis technique or web graph in data mining  provides a visualization analysis tool to fmd manually  association relations. Web graph shows relationships between  markets. By filtering out the weakest strength of the  relationship, the stronger compartments emerge from the  network.

In fact, web-link analysis is similar to m-slice analysis in  social network. For one-mode networks (often rather dense)  derived from two-mode affiliation networks, one of methods  defming cohesive subgroups is based on line multiple rather  than the number of neighbors because they are less personal  and more institutional [14]. From this point of view, the larger  the number of common entrant (i.e. export enterprise) between  two markets, the stronger or more cohesive their tie, the more  similar or interdependent they are.

Figure 3. Market-Web in 2000(link strength >=70)  We draw market-web graph according to the strength of  relationships between market and market. Nodes of web graph  represent markets. The larger the node, the larger the market  share. The weight of edge linking two nodes represents the  number of common export-enterprises. For instance, in Figure  4, the strength or common links is 5016 between "Hong Kong"  and "USA". In other words, the association relationship  between "Hong Kong" and "USA" is strongest.

The growth of market association relation network from  2000 to 2005 indicated market web expanding over time,  leading to the emergence of "hub" market group or critical  nodes set. In Figure 3 and Figure 4, the most densely linked  group of market around Hong Kong and USA. This densely  linked group consists mainly of countries in North America,  Western Europe, Japan and Australia. Several Asia countries,  Korea, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and U.A.E., became most  potential foreign market, which reflects the regional component  of private enterprise export trade development because of  geographical advantage.

Figure 4. Market-Web in 2005 (link strength >=2200)  Although some emerging markets, the export markets  converge a few trade partners or countries. The cumulative  system effect will result in unstable in export trade, which is  vulnerable to international economic fluctuation, in particular,  arising from "Hubs" markets (having a large degree). The  reason is, from systems perspective, the structure of system  always affects functions (not only positive effect but also  negative effect). This fact is likely to explain that export share  in traditional market experienced a significantly decline  between 2008 and 2009 due to impact of America fmancial  crisis.

CONCLUSION  In this paper, we firstly analyzed varying topology  properties on the structure of export market based on bipartite  network modeling at different time snapshot. Secondly, we  used data mining approach to mine most frequent market  association patterns hidden in large bipartite network data. The  empirical results provided a new insight to understand the  system behavior on the aggregate level and how they can be    trance back to the structural properties, hidden links and  underlying rules.

Guangdong stumbled onto an export and foreign  investment strategy that has proved remarkably successful,  helping the economy move quickly to a market-based system.

One of key elements in Guangdong's success in the world  markets has been the so-called 'Hong Kong connection'. In the  mid-1980s, Hong Kong entrepreneurs began shifting  manufacturing facilities to China mainland, attracted by lower  labor costs as wages rose rapidly at home. This link with Hong  Kong has not only brought much needed capital to Guangdong  but also supplied new technology, modem management  practices and critical links to the world market. Today more  than half of Guangdong's exports to the rest of the world are  handled by Hong Kong.

But the global crisis of industrialization offers important  lessons for Guangdong's economic development as well. The  Guangdong suffered from a sharp decline in export demand,  large-scale closures of Small and Medium Enterprises and  massive lay-offs of migrant worker. Labor-intensive,  export-oriented sectors have gradually lost much of their  competitive edge, as rising costs of labor, land and raw  materials and stagnant selling prices have eroded their profit  margin in recent years. Even without the financial crisis, the  industrial sector in Guangdong needs to be restructured and  upgraded, just like what the Asian Tigers have been  experiencing during the last twenty years.

However in the long run, structural problems such as  over-dependence on export markets, shortfalls in education and  R&D development and absence of proper protection of  property rights will emerge as major constraints for successful  restructuring. There are still some big challenges ahead to  adjust the structure of export goods.

Considering economics network as a complex adaptive  system, motivation of agent will be very helpful to study the  formation of market network and mechanism of evolution. In  the future we will focus on the research in that aspect. The  research fmdings will provide some helpful suggestions for  export-enterprises or management department.
