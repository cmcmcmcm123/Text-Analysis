Secured e-health data retrieval in DaaS and Big Data

Abstract? Big Data is one of rising IT trends such as cloud computing, social networking or ubiquitous computing. Big Data can offer beneficial scenarios in the e-health arena.

However, one of the scenarios can be that Big Data needs to be kept secured for a long time in order to gain its benefits such as finding cures for infectious diseases and keeping patients? privacy. From this connection, it is beneficial to analyze Big Data to make meaningful information while the data are stored in a secure manner. Thus, the analysis of various database encryption techniques is essential. In this study, we simulated 3 types of technical environments such as Plain-text, Microsoft Built-in Encryption, and custom Advanced Encryption Standard using Bucket Index in Data-as-a-Service. The results showed that custom AES-DaaS has faster range query response time than MS built-in encryption. In addition, while carrying out the scalability test, we acknowledged there are performance thresholds according to physical IT resources.

Therefore, for the purpose of efficient Big Data management in e-health, it is noteworthy to examine its scalability limits as well even if it is under cloud computing environment.

Furthermore, when designing an e-health database, both patients? privacy and system performance needs to be dealt as top priorities.

I.  INTRODUCTION/ ASSUMPTION Big Data is one of rising IT trends such as cloud  computing, social networking and ubiquitous computing.

Even though Big Data means ?Big Data? literally, its concept is still not clear in business fields such as e-health. It is worth exploring what features Big Data has, where it can be utilized or why it is an important concern. This research assume some utilization scenarios as following. In terms of eHealth, Big Data has several benefits. For example, Big Data can advise patients to choose appropriate medical practitioners to cure patients with more success ratio, it can match patients alike such so that they can connect with each other so that they can communicate and share information with respect to their treatments. Healthcare professionals can also benefit from Big Data. For instance it can enable drug procurement officers to estimate purchasing medicine times and costs, it can enable pharmacies manage customers? buying experiences, accumulate their points and make more discounts for when it is available. Big Data can also explore how efficiently medical emergency systems operate and are  controlled such as an ambulance?s arrival time at a patient?s house and bring them to appropriate medical practitioners within a given time and collect all the patients? sensor data seamlessly through mobile device to machine communication. Big Data can also be securely kept and stored for decades to find cures for infectious diseases such as Human immunodeficiency virus infection/ acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS).

From the above examples, it is clearly beneficial to analyze Big Data to make meaningful information while the data are stored in a secured manner. Therefore, it is appealing to retrieve valuable information more effectively while the raw data are encrypted for patients? privacy. Thus, one of absolute methods to keep the raw data safe is to use database encryption. In the Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) environment [1], the ownership of data security belongs to the data owner. Nowadays, it is a time of cloud computing that provides Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) [2], Platform-as- a-Service (PaaS) [3] and Infrastructure-as- a-Service (IaaS) [4]. Even though cloud computing providers such as Microsoft, Amazon and Google state reliability for customers? data, data owners are still responsible for keeping their data proactive. Therefore, it is vital to handle Big Data as formatted or unformatted such as NoSQL [5]. However, this research focus on the use of traditional Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) rather than NoSQL in the condition that some sensitive data are encrypted.

In this paper, we simulate a scalability test for DaaS. We propose that it will be suitable for scalability testing of Big Data.



II. LITERATURE REVIEW In this section, the concepts of Big Data, e-health, cloud,  DaaS, and encryption techniques are introduced.

A. Features of Big Data Gartner states that ?Big Data is high-volume, high-velocity and high-variety information assets that demand cost- effective, innovative forms of information processing for enhanced insight and decision making? [6]. Therefore, volume, velocity and variety (3V) are significant features of Big Data. At present, even personal computers are using a number of terabytes of hard disks. Smart phones are collecting vast amount of personal behaviours and attributes      such as geo-location data and movement tricking. New Twitter mentions were created by 33,388 tweets per second on January 1 2013, when the new year began [7].

B. E-Health in the cloud E-health clouds can stimulate new potentials, such as  super-massive workloads and machine to machine (M2M) access of medical information and business logic for stakeholders [8]. Cloud computing can provide cost- effective, scale-up, scale-out, less downtime, and disaster recovery. In the case of the Australian healthcare sector, cloud computing is one of rising technologies that creates values from health information exchange [9]. Cloud computing enables the e-health database owners store data for decades. The information extracted and reprocessed from the data will be extremely valuable for curing diseases and encouraging patients. On the other hand, the database encryption techniques are still useful in e-health cloud scenarios because the database owners are responsible for their data even if cloud vendors promise database security as a top priority task.

C. Logical Data Model in Cloud SQL Server In this study, we focus on Microsoft SQL Server as a  DaaS model dataset. Its characteristics can be similar to on- premise SQL server and SQL Azure, which is a cloud database. In Cloud SQL Server, a logical database is called as a table group. A table group can be keyless or keyed. A keyless table group is a normal SQL Server database. There are no limitations on choosing keys for its tables. However, if a table group is keyed, all of its tables should include a common column called the partitioning key [10].

D.  DaaS and database security Data as a Service (DaaS) was a transitional concept for  database management before the concept of cloud computing was popular. It permits data owners to outsource their data to Database Service Providers (DSP) to reduce the maintenance cost. However, if the data is encrypted, faster query response times for the data become a serious issue [11]. The database encryption techniques can be varied to database owners? planning.

E. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) AES is a symmetric encryption which can be called as  Rijndael algorithm. It was suggested to replace Data Encryption Standard (DES) which was also a block cipher.

?Rijndael is a parameterized algorithm in that it can operate on block size of 128, 192, or 256 bits? [12].

F. Bloom filter and collections A Bloom filter only responds ?yes? or ?no? even if it  stores the actual data. A Bloom filter can be utilized to facilitate quick answers in a key-value storage system[13].

The algorithm is applied in Database Management System (DBMS) such as Oracle 10g R2 and its implementation is introduced as an open source using C# and other programming languages. The following Bucket Index can utilize a Bloom filter as an element in querying translator.

There is performance comparison between collection objects such as Bloom filter, HashSet and HashTable as follows.

Figure 1.performance ratio among collection objects [14]  This figure depicts Bloom filter memory loading time takes slightly longer than HashSet or HashTable under Singleton design patterned Bucket Index. HashSet stores only distinctive data whereas HashTable store ?key=value?.

Overall, HashTable shows fastest response time than the others.

G. Database security technique ? Bucket Index Bucket index application use a bloom filter as a  collection of key information that indicates ?true? if the data exist in the database. The bucket index engine can have a singleton-patterned architecture for storing key information.

Among CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations, read operation performances are a main concern because it is most heavily used.

Figure 2.Bucket Index Architecture [15]  0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8  1.2  Memory?Loading? Time  Search?Time  Bloom?Filter  HashSet  HashTable       Figure 3.classification of MS built-in encryption [16]  The Bucket Index system can be described as a partitioning data model. At first it collects a coarse partitioning data and after refining the data, decrypt the selected narrower range of data which is partitioned. It will reduce the query response time which is typically a read operation significantly. However, its implementation can be varied with respect to the Bloom filter as a querying translator.

H. Database security technique ? MS built-in encryption Microsoft provides a combination of the encryption/  decryption programming approach from a database administrator?s (DBA) point of view. Firstly, the DBA can choose a master key of the database. Secondly, s/he can choose a certificate or asymmetric key for managing symmetric key to encrypt the database. The master key is also used in managing a certificate or asymmetric key as a hierarchical structure [14].



I. Measurement Technology (performance) ? Client_response_time: is the total network included  round-trip time as requested by the client, starting from sending the request to receiving the corresponding response.

? Processing_time: the amount of time for processing the request on the server side.

? DB_processing_time: ideally the amount of time a database takes to process Structured Query Language (SQL) [17].

Therefore, the generalized performance measurement principle can be as follows.

Client_response_time  >  Processing_time  >  DB_processing_time

III. METHOD Simulation results confirm various database encryption  techniques are significant to review secured data retrieval.

The results provide scalability and performance review based on query response times. The data were generated randomly as patients? biological and social identities.

Table 1: Database Encryption approach using DaaS models [14] Data Types (DB) Encryption  (types) DaaS model used  Plain-Text [PT] No encryption No DaaS roles MS built-in Encryption [MSE]  Combination of Master database key, Triple DES, Asymmetric key  Role based DaaS  AES-DaaS [DAS]  Advance Encryption Standard  Recommended to DaaS, all encryption / decryption logic is on the application side, not on the database side   Table 2.query conditions for performance test  String Numeric Aggregate Range Range- Bucket Index  Range- Count  Address Medicare number  Blood type Birth date Birth date Birth date  The basic design is to measure typically select query response times among plain-text, MS built-in encryption and AES-DaaS models. The custom AES-DaaS using Bucket Index is to create additional field for key query conditions in encrypted state.

The software packages used in the simulation are MS Visual Studio 2010 using C# and MS SQL Server 2008. The processor is Intel Core 2 duo with Windows XP.

The query conditions are in the following table.



IV. SIMULATION RESULTS  Table 3 depicts the times consumed to build up the three environments (Plain-text, MS built-in Encryption, AES- DaaS) when the data is increased from 5K records to 2560K records. The data was dummy and randomly generated by a console C# application.

The results showed that the MS built-in encryption model took the longest build-up time compared to custom AES-DaaS model or Plain-Text (PT) model.

On the other hand, AES-DaaS model consumes physically additional field in tables. Here, we used extra Bucket Index fields for birth dates. To avoid unnecessary database connection trials, we used a Bloom filter in Singleton Design Patterned. It answers ?yes? or ?no? for the existence of the data before making a connection to the database.

Table 4 shows the categorized scalability result in the three environments (Plain-text, MS built-in encryption, AES- DaaS). ?Aggr? means Aggregate query for blood type. RQ means normal range query for birth dates. RC means just to get a counted number of the range query for birth dates.

The RBI feature is only available to custom AES- DaaS model. In the simulation, we used 70 partitioning for Bucket Index. The Bucket Index in the AES-DaaS showed approximately 7 times faster response time than the normal Range query when the record size was 2560K. Thus, Bucket  Index is quite useful in custom AES-DaaS model when databases are bigger.

In figure 4, numeric type scalability trend is drawn for medicare card number. From 5K to 1280K record-sized, the line graph increases gradually, however, in 2560K, the MS built-in encryption technique show abrupt increased query response time. This means there are certain performance threshold points in any hardware / software.



V. CONCLUSION If the AES-DaaS model can be adopted, the Bucket  Index, in other word, partitioning and singleton design patterned architecture is a useful framework when range queries are heavily used.

Figure 4.numeric type scalability trend(milliseconds) [14]    In addition, if the data characteristic is numeric, the study shows number type is more acceptable to character type when designing the database.

Finally, the custom AES with Bucket Index shows faster response time than MS built-in encryption. Therefore, when we deal with Big Data encryption techniques, custom encryption techniques are recommended. Besides, cloud DBMS does not support the full feature of on-premise DBMS such as MS SQL Server.

In conclusion, we covered secured e-health data retrieval in the environments of PT, MSE, and DaaS.

Custom encryption techniques can increase the efficiency of DBMSs while data needs to be encrypted in a DaaS or Big Data environment. However, Big Data stores enormous data         5K 10K 20K 40K 80K 160K 320K 640K 1280K2560K  PT  MSE  DAS      continuously. Thus, when we design e-health database in Big Data system, we need to define which fields of data to be encrypted and cost-effective on limited physical IT resources. For this reason, it will be advantageous to investigate the scalability limits to support seamless and consistent Big Data management.



VI.  FUTURE WORK Transaction Processing Performance Council Benchmark  E (TPC-E) represents the operations of an On-line Transaction Processing (OLTP) system or custom performance checker [18]. This can be used as performance test index for further Big Data simulation. The additional Big Data simulation requires extremely large-scaled records over 1 billion with the same query plan. Besides, the cloud computing environment will support the simulation.
