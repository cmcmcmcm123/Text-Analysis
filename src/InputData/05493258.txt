I. INTRODUCTION With the continuous improvement on the level of research  management, the scientific research administrative personnel hope that they can in conduct the scientific research and the policy-making support management on the basis of the existing mass data analysis. However, these data, involving a larger perspective, are voluminous, the present Event-driven database is difficult to achieve information synthesis and comprehensive, flexible, multi-angle analysis on a large amounts of data, thus do not have decision-making support capability. In order to more effectively make use of each scientific research project to take scientific and technological development goals, scientific research management decision-makers carry on statistical analysis frequently on the benefit from the project, including the ability to train professional and technical personnel, the inputs and outputs funding inputs and outputs, the comparative analysis on the execution and completion process of the project the comparative analysis ,etc. In order to solve the actual problems encountered in the process of benefit analysis and the policy-making support, this article proposed a framework that  combines data warehouse, associated data mining and the OLAP technology, and constructed the Handan City Science and Technology Plan Project Implementation Survey System.



II. GENERAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE  SYSTEM This system take the data warehouse as the foundation,  OLAP multidimensional analysis as a means, and the associative rules to carry on data mining. Users may act according to the demand to extract data from the progress of the data warehouse, analyze the project progress, dig out useful information with associative rule for decision support, then demonstrate the result in the front end of the user interface. as shown in Fig1. The hierarchy system is divided into four layers: data source layer, data storage layer, data processing layer, and data demonstration layer.

Data source layer: the basis of the data warehouse on which users extract the required information for refining, cleaning and conversion so as to load into the data marts.

Data storage layer: After effective integration the previously cleaned data, organize the result by the subject in order to carry on multidimensional analysis and data mining.

Data Processing Layer: with inquiry sentences the OLAP server extract data sets required by data warehouse and carry on multidimensional data analysis in it. Data mining extracted the useful knowledge from the data warehouse using association rules.

Data demonstration layer: namely the user interface. The OLAP front end analysis system demonstrate the results in visualized form, such as tables and graphics. Data mining helps decision-makers find potential linkage between data sets to support tendency prediction and decision-making.



III. THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OLAP  A. Design of Multidimensional Data Mode Data model is a typical form of data structure, and a  recognition of the real-world from a different extraction level.

Different data model of extraction level can be established from the real world through step by step abstraction, refinement.

DOI 10.1109/CESCE.2010.165    DOI 10.1109/CESCE.2010.165       The aim of the data model design is to visualize the organizational structure and the relationship of the data in an intuitive way, which will be served as the basis for further design and impmentation, hence get the specific data structure of the system, and form the system framework. Though the data warehouse fact tables and dimension tables are organized according to the analysis subject, they are still stored in the form of two-dimensional table in a relational database. In order to facilitate the OLAP multidimensional analysis, OLAP tools are used to create multi-dimensional data sets, then carry on multi-dimensional processing to data warehouse's data, and present to the front end user in an easy to understand form.

In order to get the multi-dimensional data set  to be used in the OLAP analysis in Handan City Science and Technology Plan Project Implementation Survey System, several aspects  needs to take into consideration, including  theme analysis, logistic model design, metric standard and processing method.

1) theme Analysis :Multi-dimensional data sets are also subject oriented, the same as the data warehouse. In this step, analysis theme should be pre-determined, then carry on explicit description for each subject domain. The original database contains two correlated crossing themes, the basic project information theme and the project progress information theme. As the core of the system is to implement management of these projects, when issuing multi-dimensional data model design work will be carried on around project progress theme to establish fact tables.

2)  Logical model design:The logistic model directly reflect business department?s requirements and plays an major  Data storage layer Data analysis layer Data display  layer  Project scheduleThe Handan City Science and  Technology Plan Project  Implementation Survey System.

This system's logistic employs star model, the structure characteristics of star which is: in the center is a big and redundancy free fact table that is used to store dimension table foreign key and metric value for each dimension; around which is a small group of affiliated table, called dimensiontable which is an entity of record an organization wants and contains dimension levels and member types etc. Each dimension use at least a table to hold its metadata. Dimension tables appear on the rays scattered from the fact table, like the outburst of stars. That?s why stars mode bears its name. The system logic model is shown in Figure 2.

3)  metrics value:The metrics value refers to the columns of data that is used as an indicator to reflect  one aspect of the multi-dimension data sets, and is the key data when the end- user browsing multi-dimensional data. Metric values of  the multi-dimensional data sets can be obtained through simple process by data warehouse or obtained from the computation result of other metrics value.

4)  processing method:When the construction of storage structure of the multi-dimensional data sets is finished, no data was actually put in and needs to be processed. The processing process begins when the data is transferred from the data source to data warehouse. After aggregation calculation the results are stored in the multi-dimensional data set. When issuing analysis and query the user only needs to read the processed data from the MSOLAP server rather than extract the unprocessed data from data warehouse.

B. OLAP analysis The OLAP analysis is mainly focused on analysis, such as  slicing, dicing, drilling, and rotation on  the multi-dimensional data. Slicing refers to concentrate to observe data in two dimensions. Dicing refers to choose certain dimensions(3 usually) to carry on analysis. Drill-down refers to observe multi-dimensional data from the synthesized data on a higher level dimension to the detailed data on a lower level dimension.

Drill-up refer to carry on aggregation analysis from detailed data to synthesized data. Rotation refers to change the location relationship between dimensions to facilitate user to observe data from another perspective. After the OLAP analysis users can observe the data from multiple dimensions, multiple perspectives, and multiple aggregative degrees as to find the rules hidden behind the data.



IV. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MINING ASSOCIATION RULES ALGORITHM  The association rule describes the knowledge pattern of rules that appears simultaneously in a transaction between the event, therefore association rules can be employed to spot the connection pattern hidden in the scientific research data attribute. The most classical connection rule algorithm is the Apriori algorithm which is proposed by R.Agrawal, Imielinski and Swam etc. support coefficient and confidence coefficient are two important concepts used to describe association rules, the former used to measure significance of association rules in the whole data set, the latter used to measure the credibility of  the association rules. The classical Apriori algorithm carries on full pruning to the item set, and only calculate the support coefficient of the candidate item set which are greater than or equal to the minimum support coefficient. However, with k increases, the length of each candidate item in Ck also increases correspondingly, but the support coefficient decrease,and the Apriori algorithm have to scan the whole database to carry on support coefficient computation thus waste a lot of time. Therefore, improved algorithm is proposed in this excavation. Ideas of the improved algorithm is as follows:  ? Corollary 1: Any item set in Ck must be a superset of some item set in Ck-1.

? Corollary 2: If the number of item set in a transaction that contains Ck-1 is less than k, then delete( or ignore) the transaction has no effect on the calculation of Lj(j>=k).

According to the above deduction, Given that the scale of item set remains the same, we use Lk, Ck to select the database, thus reduced the times searching for the record in the database, finally improved the efficiency of the algorithm. The main idea of adapted Apriori algorithm is to delete  transactions that do not contain any item set of Ck+1 at the link stage when produces Ck+1 initially. There is no need to carry on support .coefficient computation, so the record number related with support coefficient calculation for the candidate item set is less than that in the original database, thus increased the algorithm efficiency at last.

This paper take the researchers? workload, the finished scientific and technological papers and reports, and the completion level of the project as an example to describe the complete process of association rules. Summarized according to the actual situation of the system, the results is shown in Table 1:  According to the distributed characteristic of the attribute data ,carry on the discretization and integraliztion on the attribute value, and finally represented as boolean value. For convenience, researchers? workload attribute is simplified as G, the number of scientific and technological papers and reports is simplified as W, and use P to stand for completion level of the project, for short.

The separated and integeralized data sheet are shown in Table 2. Here, the attribute values can be transformed into yes or no boolean variables of association rules. For example, G1 stands for the workload of G is at level1, W2 stands for the  TABLE I. SCHEDULE OF SAMPLES  Workload Project No  Papers/Reports Completion level  20090141 550 4 73  20090142 523 3 86  20090143 374 6 94  20090144        235 0 77  ??       number of scientific and technological papers and reports is at level 2, P3 stands for the completion level of the project is at level 3, and so on. The boolean value result is shown in Table2.

Use the connection rule generation algorithm, and trace the implementation process given Minconfidence=0.85. We get two strong association rules we interested in:  ? {G4 B3}         confidence=0.84 ? {G3G2 P1} confidence=0.882 We used interest measurement method to measure interest  degree for the above strong association rule, and the results is shown in Table 3.:  What can be seen in Table 4 is the probability that G?s occurrence causes W?s occurrence increases, that is G?s occurrence plays an positive role on W?s occurrence. so G W rule can be used as knowledge to provide to the policy- maker.
