Abstract?Distributed Space Missions (DSMs) are gaining  momentum in their application to earth science missions  owing to their unique ability to increase observation  sampling in spatial, spectral and temporal dimensions  simultaneously. This paper identifies a gap in the angular  sampling abilities of traditional monolithic spacecraft and  proposes to address it using small satellite clusters in  formation flight. The science performance metric for the  angular dimension is explored using the Bidirectional  Reflectance-distribution Function (BRDF), which describes  the directional variation of reflectance of a surface element.

Previous studies have proposed the use of clusters of  nanosatellites in formation flight, each with a VNIR imaging  spectrometer, to make multi-spectral reflectance  measurements of a ground target, at different zenith and  azimuthal angles simultaneously. In this paper, a tradespace  of formation flight geometries will be explored in order to  optimize or maximize angular spread and minimize BRDF  estimation errors. The simulated formation flight solutions  are applied to the following case studies: Snow albedo  estimation in the Arctic and vegetation in the African  savannas. Results will be compared to real data from  previous airborne missions (NASA?s ARCTAS Campaign in  2008 and SAFARI Campaign in 2000).
