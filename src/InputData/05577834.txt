Discovery of multi-level spatial  association rules based on DE-9IM

Abstract: Expression and definition of spatial relationship are  crucial for spatial data mining. A new method of spatial  relationship expression based on DE-9IM theory is proposed.

The accurate spatial topology relationship between different  objects can be expressed when this method is used in multi-level  association rules discovery. The corresponding algorithm is also  implemented and efficiency is enhanced by the MBR test and  meta-rule. Experimental results show that the algorithm is valid  and efficient.

I. INTRODUCTION  Association rule discovery, as one of the important component of data mining, already has a deep and extensive research. Now it is used in spatial data mining after expansion and improvement by some researchers, and corresponding discovery algorithms of spatial association rules and even multi-level spatial association rules have been proposed.

Association rules in geo-database are similar to those in transaction database, such as A?B[s%,c%],where A and B are predicates set, s% is the support of the rule, and c% is the confidence of the rule[1]. In A or B there are not only non- spatial predicates but spatial predicates as well, which are used to describe relationship between spatial objects like topological relationship (intersect, overlap, disjoint), distance relationship(close-to, far-away, distance interval),locative relationship(left, west) and so on. And many researches of the spatial association rules are based on the hierarchy of spatial predicates defined as Figure.1.

Figure 1.  The hierarchy of spatial predicates.

Spatial predicates definition and concept hierarchy are discussed in this paper base on the dimension-extend 9 intersect matrix model (DE-9IM). The hierarchy has some difference with Figure.1 but the DE-9IM from all the hierarchy has been described by regular expression. And corresponding discovery algorithm of multi-level spatial association rules is designed and has been tested with farmland geo-database of Hongta district in Yuxi city in Yunnan province. The algorithm is proved to be valid and efficient by experiment.



II. DIMENSION-EXTEND 9 INTERSECT MATRIX  Dimension-extend 9 intersect matrix is a extension from 9 intersect matrix by Clementini and etc[6][7].

dim( ) dim( ) dim( ) ( , ) dim( ) dim( ) dim( )  dim( ) dim( ) dim( )  o o o o  o  o  a b a b a b M a b a b a b a b  a b a b a b  ?  ?  ? ? ? ?  ? ?? ?? ? ? ?= ? ? ? ?? ? ?? ? ? ?? ?? ?? ?    Where a,b are polygons in topological space, and a-  ,ao,?(a) respectively represent internal, external and edge of  g-close-to  Not-disjoint  Covered-by  close-to  Intersects Inside contains equal  Adjacent-to intersects contains inside  Far-away  covers     the polygons. And -1 in the function dim(a)=p,p?{-1,0,1,2} means empty set of the geometry, 0,1,2 respectively represents that a is 0 dimension(point), or 1 dimension(line),or 2 dimension(polygon).

The range of dim(x) is {-1,0,1,2} and in dimension- extend 9 intersect matrix there are 49=262144 kinds of relationships theoretically. However, not so many relationship types are meaningful to the discovery of spatial association rules and thus they have a reduction in this paper. Firstly a symbol set{T, F, *} is introduced which makes dim(x) ?{- 1,0,1,2,T,F,*},where T denotes p?{0,1,2} and geometry ?a? exists, F denotes p=-1 and geometry ?a? is an empty set(not existed), * denotes p?{-1,0,1,2} and geometry ?a? can be an empty set or not.

The dimension-extend 9 intersect matrix discussed above has 49 kinds of relationship theoretically and can finely define and distinguish the topology of the spatial objects.

However, large amount of spatial relationship is too much detailed in data mining especially in macro data mining and many of them can not be even described in nature language[2].

Presented as Table 1, a macro spatial predicates concept hierarchy model is built based on dimension-extend 9 intersect matrix and topology names and the row priority matrix are given below:  TABLE I.  SOME KINDS OF TOPOLOGY AND CORRESPONDING DE-9IM  Spatial Topology  Polygon Dimension DE-9IM  Equals All *  * * *  T F F  F F  ? ? ? ?? ? ? ?    Disjoint All * *  * * *  F F F F ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

A.disjoint(B) Contains  A.contains(B) = B.within(A)  In the second column of the table, ?P? represents 0 dimension geometric body, such as point and multi-point; ?L? represents 1 dimension geometric body, such as line and polyline; ?A? represents  2 dimension geometric body, such as polygon and multi-polygon. Take ?L/A? for example, it shows the topology relationship between line and polygon in DE- 9IM.

For the DE-9IM is associated with the dimension of the corresponding geometric body, some examples will be given combined with the algorithms in next section.



III. SPATIAL ASSOCIATION RULES MINING  A. Related Definitions  Some definitions for the algorithm are given below [3]: Definition 1. The form of spatial association rules is:  ( )P P P Q Q Q s%  ,  c%  m n1 1k k? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Where P1?Pk?Pm and Q 1?Q k?Q n have at least one spatial  predicate, s% is the support of the rule, and c% is the confidence of  the rule.

In the data set?s?, the support of the rule ??(P?Q/S)?is the radio of objects number , which meet the requirement P1???Pk???Pm and Q 1???Q k???Qm, and cardinal number of ?S?. The  confidence of the rule ??(P?Q/S)? is the radio of  ??(P?Q/ S)?and  ??(P/S)?.

Definition 2. If the support of predicates set ?P? is greater than or  equal the least support threshold value ?min from k level, then ?P? is  frequent in set ?S? with k levels and all its ancestors in concept tree  are frequent on their corresponding levels. If the support of the rule  P?Q/ S is greater than or equal the least support threshold value ?min from k level, then the ?k? level include the high rule.

Definition 3. If predicates ?P?Q? is frequent in set ?S? and the  support of the rule ?P?Q/S? is high, then the rule ?P?Q/S? is a  strong rule.

A conclusion from the above definitions shows that spatial  association rules are still the multi-dimension association rules within  the confidence-support framework. There are some problems existing  in multi-dimension association rules mining: 1)When the support set  is very high, the rules from mining are less and lack of  representative. 2) When the support set is too low, the mining results  would have an explosive growth and it was proved to be an  significant appearance in practice. In order to enhance mining work  efficiency, the concept ?meta-rule? was introduced in this paper.

Definition 4. The following rule form is a meta-rule    P P P Q Q Q1 k m 1 k n??? ??? ? ??? ???  Where Pi ( I= 1, ?,m ) and Qj ( j= 1, ?, n) are example predicates  or predicate variables.

Definition 5. If R is consistent with Mp, then spatial association  rule ?R? obeys the meta-rule ?Mp?. It is assumed that there is a meta-  rule as:  is-a(X,land)?S(Y,X)?P(Y,M)?Q(Z,C)  Then the following rule obeys the meta-rule:  is-a(X,land) ?Crosses(Y,X)?is_a (Y,highway)?income (X,high)  B. Algorithm design and implementation  The multi-level spatial association rule algorithm proposed in the paper is as follows:  TABLE II.  SPATIAL ASSOCIATION RULE ALGORITHM BASED ON DE-9IM  Input SDB?geo-database; Ref_Obj_Set?reference object set; TaskRel_Obj_Set?task-related object set; Sp_CH?spatial predicate concept hierarchy ; Mp: meta-rule min_sup[l]: the least support threshold value in corresponding concept hierarchy; min_conf[l]: the least confidence threshold value in corresponding concept hierarchy;  Output Strong spatial association rule Algorithm   (1) Relevant_SDB:=extract_task_relevant_objects(SDB, Ref_Obj_Set, TaskRel_Obj_Set) (2) MBR_Relevant_DB:=MBR_Test(Relevant_SDB) (3) DE-9IM _Predicate_DB := extract_DE- 9IM_Predicate(MBR_Relevan_DB) (4) for (Level=1; Level <= Sp_CH .Level & Predicate_DB !=Null?; Level++) { (5) SpatialPredicate_DB := ensure_ SpatialPredicate(Sp_CH [Level], DE-9IM _Predicate_DB); (6) mine_association_rules(SpatialPredicate_DB,Mp, min_sup[Level], min_conf[Level]); }//eo for  Procedure mine_association_rules(SpatialPredicate_DB,Mp, min_sup, min_conf){ /* get frequence1- spatial predicate set*/ L1=find_frequent_1-itemsets(SpatialPredicate_DB); for(k:=2;Lk-1??;k++) { /*get Ck from frequence (k-1) predicates table*/ Ck:=get_candidate_set(L[k-1]); foreach s in SpatialPredicate_DB { /*get candidate Ps from Ck*/ Ps := get_subsets(Ck ,s); for each candidate p?Ps {  /* calculate support of each candidate item in Ps*/ p.support++;  } }//eo foreach  L[k] :={ p?Ck | p.support? minsup[l]}; /*test frequence K-predicates set up to the total number of meta-rule or not*/ if (k= length (Mp) ){ /* output association rules from L[k] according meta-rule*/ output= generate_association_rules (L[k],Mp) ; }//eo if }//eo for }//eo for }//eo Procedure ?mine_association_rules?  SDB from the input in the table is the geo-database composed of spatial data and attribute data.SDB is a geo- database like ESRI ArcSDE, Oracle Spatial?Postgis and so no.

Ref_Obj_Set and TaskRel_Obj_Set are reference object set and task-related object set. Because of the huge number of data during the spatial association rule mining and calculation time consumption, object in SDB are divided into two parts (Ref_Obj_Set and TaskRel_Obj_Set)[5]. Reference object is the subject for problem description and task-related object which is from spatial query has a spatial association relationship with reference object.

For example, Ref_Obj_Set={farmland block?farmland income},TaskRel_Obj_Set={resident zone?traffic network ?water resources},Sp_CH is spatial predicates concept hierarchy.It is assumed that the Ref_Obj_Set in current mining task is farmland block (2 dimension polygon, A)in SDB,TaskRel_Obj_Set is resident zone (2 dimension polygon, A), traffic network (1 dimension line, L), water resources(1 dimension line, L).According to table ?,the spatial predicates concept hierarchy is built as follows:   Figure 2.  spatial predicates concept hierarchy  As it shows in Figure.2 the spatial predicates concept hierarchy is divided into 4 levels(0?3).The number before the spatial predicate is serial number of the level and the brace under the predicate shows the row priority string model for  0.G-Close to  1.Intersects  {?A.disjoint(B) }  1.Disjoints  {FF*FF**** }  2.Within  {T*F**F*** }  2.Crosses  {T*T****** }  2.Touches  {FT*******} or{  F**T*****}  or{F***T****}  2.Contains  { A.contains(B) =  B ithi (A) }  3.Equal  {T*F**FFF*}  3.Overlaps  {T*T***T**}  3.Equal  {T*F**FFF*}    the corresponding DE-9IM which is called DE-9IM String in the paper. Data mining task always begins from the 1st level min_sup[l] and min_conf[l] are respectively the least support and least confidence in the first level in Sp_CH.

Now, the algorithm subject is explained in detail according to the serial number before each statement as follows:  ? (1) export Relevant_SDB  from geodatabase according to the input Ref_Obj_Set and TaskRel_Obj_Set.

? (2) test the reference object and task-related object in Relevant_SDB by using MBR method (Minimal Bounding Rectangle). MBR method is always used as the geometric solution of spatial object and is defined such rectangle that completely contains the object[4].

The inherent defect of MBR lies in the inconsistency between the MBR relationship and practical topology relationship from objects. For example, if the two objects are overlap but the actual topology might be separated. However, because of the superset coverage character and less time consuming compared with DE- 9IM String determination, MBR method is fit for the spatial association rules mining in this paper. And after MBR test in 2nd step, the spatial predicates of Ref_Obj_Set and TaskRel_Obj_Set in Relevant_SDB is roughly divided into two types: one passed the MBR test and the other not passed. For the MBR test allows Positive Testing but not Negative Testing, then the spatial predicates not passing the MBR test are considered as disjoints (Disjoints , FF*FF****)in the following calculation and only those passed ones need further determination. The divided Relevant_SD is denoted as MBR_Relevant_DB.

? (3) export spatial predicates table of reference object and task-related object that denoted by DE-9IM String from MBR_Relevant_DB(DE-9IM _Predicate_DB).The table contains detailed topology relationship of reference object and task-related object and its form will be expressed in the latter table ?.

Divided information is used during the export process.

? (4) make a recursion of each spatial predicates concept hierarchy and discover the corresponding spatial association rules.

? (5) According to Figure.1, generalize the spatial predicates in E-9IM _Predicate_DB which means making each detailed DE-9IM String generalized to current concept hierarchy spatial predicates. As showed in table 3, the DE-9IM String generalization in the paper used regular expression.And in this step, the  DE-9IM String using regular expression in DE-9IM _Predicate_DB will be generalized to corresponding spatial predicates.

(6) discover association rules by using Apriori property and the detailed process is shown in mine_association_rules. And the algorithm uses meta- rule when exports the strong association rules.

Awaiting discovery rule form is defined in meta-rule including logic relationship, the number of example predicates and so on. The introduction of meta-rule enhanced the effectiveness of strong association rule.

Moreover, heuristic information in original rule is used in mining process and candidate frequence k-predicate table will be straightly generated from frequence 1- predicate table not using the gradually deduction method in the paper. Then after scaning DE-9IM _Predicate_DB, the support of each candidate k- predicate table is calculated and the candidate k- predicate which is no less than the least support in corresponding concept hierarchy will be chosen to built frequence k-predicate table. After that, according meta-rule and the least support of corresponding concept hierarchy, strong spatial association rules will be created from frequence k-predicate table.



IV. EXPERIMENT  Algorithm of spatial association rules based on DE-9IM is implemented by java language and the API class library of JTS(JAVA Topology Suite) is used to built the 9 intersect matrix of polygons.

The following spatial association rules mining process used farmland spatial data of Hongta area in Yuxi city in Yunnan province and the algorithm proposed in this paper is also explained:  SDB in this example is farmland decide-grade spatial database in Yunnan province which includes farmland blocks, altitude, water resources, area network, residential area,    markets, central towns and other FeatureClass in most counties in Yunnan province. And each feature contains corresponding spatial information and attributes data.

Ref_Obj_Set={farmland block?farmland incoming}, TaskRel_Obj_Set={traffic resources}.

The farmland block in Ref_Obj_Set is a feature class, the farmland incoming is a field of the feature class and the attribute table is as follows:  ObjcetID Geometry annual earnings  Where the value of ?annual earnings? has five different standards as ?high?, ?relatively high?, ?medium?, ?relatively low? and ?low? after it has been discretization.

The attribute table of traffic network feature class in TaskRel_Obj_Set is as follows:  ObjcetID Geometry Road type  Where its type coding range is {VillageRoad,highway,RailRoad}.

The buffer method is used to make close-to relationship to  Intersects and Far-away relationship to Disjoints. In this test, a ten meters buffer area of traffic network which is original polyline in spatial database is formed before data mining, which made the traffic network buffer area (task-related object)has an A/A relationship with farmland block(reference object ). Then they can be described by the spatial predicates hierarchy in Figure.2.

Meta-rule: P(t,x)?Q(t,y) ?R(t,z). In order to simplified, the least support and confidence of each level had been set as 20% and 75%.

TABLE IV.  SPATIAL PREDICATE SEGMENTS  Farmland profit DE-9IM String Traffic resources low  FF2FF1212 Highway relatively low FF2FF1212 RailRoad low 212101212 VillageRoad high 212101212 Highway high 212101212 RailRoad ?? The results of spatial association rule is shown as follows: Rule 1: Is_a(X,?farmland block?) ?Disjoints(X,Highway)?farmland incoming(X,low) Explanation: The annual profit of farmland block away from the highway is ?low?.

Rule 2: Is_a(X,?farmland block?) ? Crosses(X,VillageRoad)?farmland incoming (X,?medium?).

Explanation: The annual profit of farmland block passed through by country road is ?medium?.

Rule 3: Is_a(X,? farmland block?) ? Touches(X,Highway)?farmland incoming (X,?medium?)  Explanation: The annual profit of farmland block near by the highway is ?medium?.

According to the information from the land and resource expert, farmland profit is effected by the traffic status. The spatial association rules from this experiment can be applied in local farmland decide-grade work such as the weight decision of farmland grade affected by traffic factors.



V. CONCLUSION  Expression and definition of spatial relationship are important contents in spatial data mining algorithm. A new method used for multi-level spatial association rules discovery is proposed in the paper to express and define spatial predicate and classify concept hierarchy based on DE-9IM theory. And the corresponding algorithm using MBR test and meta-rule is also put forward to enhance the efficiency of the rule discovery process. The advantage of the new algorithm is the use of precise spatial topology between reference object and task-related object to discover rules. Finally the algorithm is tested in farmland decide-grade spatial association rules mining of Hongta district in Yuxi city in Yunnan province and proved to be efficient and valid. In the future, we will make research on the micro spatial data mining based on DE-9IM.
