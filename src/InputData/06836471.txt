Towards Space Solar Power -

Abstract?In the most common space solar power (SSP) system architectures, solar energy harvested by large satellites in geo- stationary orbit is transmitted to Earth via microwave radia- tion. Currently, only limited information about the interactions of microwave beams with energy densities of several tens to  hundreds of W/m2 with the different layers of the atmosphere is available. Governmental bodies will likely require detailed investigations of safety and atmospheric effects of microwave power beams before issuing launch licenses for SSP satellite systems. This paper proposes to collect representative and comprehensive data of the interaction of power beams with the atmosphere by extending the infrastructure of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) facility in Alaska, USA. Estimates of the transmission infrastructure performance as well as measurement devices and scientific ca- pabilities of possible upgrade scenarios will be discussed. The proposed upgrade of the HAARP facility is expected to deliver a wealth of data and information which could serve as a decision base for governmental launch licensing of SSP satellites, and which can be used in addition to deepen public acceptance of SSP as a large-scale renewable energy source.
