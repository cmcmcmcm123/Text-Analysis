Research on User Groups Features of Mobile  Payment?an Empirical Analysis based on

Abstract?For quickly locating the specific user groups in the mobile payment market, this paper investigates and analyzes the Mobile Ticketing in mobile payment service from five main aspects, the users awareness, demand, usage, using willingness and users evaluation. We use data mining methods of association rules to do analysis to 1615 valid questionnaires and locate the user groups who are most likely to use Mobile Ticketing, so as to help the Communication Carriers to lock the target customers market precisely and quickly at the beginning of promotional period of Mobile Payment. The results show that mobile payment market, especially mobile ticketing, is still in the early stage, the users are with low awareness, the potential user groups are very big, the users who are willing to use mobile payment services are mostly concentrate in young user groups with high spending monthly and high education.

I. INTRODUCTION Technological innovation has changed people's lifestyles  and business models, the popularity of the mobile terminal (such as mobile phones, etc.), and the development of mobile communication technology have brought changes of the payments way, mobile payments has become increasingly popular and an important way to pay in Europe and the United States, Japan and South Korea. Mobile payment is the payment way that In order to purchase tangible or intangible form of product, pay fees or receive services, the payment side uses mobile phone, PDA and other mobile terminals to realize the transfer of funds from payments to the affected party's payment through the mobile communication network [1].

In 2008, the global mobile e-commerce revenues reached 554 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 15% of the world's online trading market share, the number of global mobile e- commerce customers reached 1.67 billion; Chinese mobile phone subscribers reached 641 million, had more than 70 million mobile E-commerce users, which indicates that mobile payment industry in China have great commercial potential.

However, the Norson Telecom forecasts show that the growth rate of mobile payment user is far lower than the growth rate of mobile phone users. What factors influence user perception and use of the mobile payment, comparing the interaction between  the customer perceived value, customer satisfaction and behavior tend of these consumers judgments by put them into a same research framework will undoubtedly be of great significance [2]. Many studies focus on this area. The study [3] researched the relationship among the customer perceived value, customer satisfaction and behavioral tendencies in the mobile payment, and found that the perceived value is the antecedent of the customer satisfaction. The study [4] has shown that perceived risk, personal innovation, social impact and perceived usefulness have a direct significant impact on the intention of use. Perceived ease of use and social impact have a direct significant impact on perceived usefulness, no direct impact on the intent of use, only an indirect effect through perceived usefulness. The studies [5-6] suggested that in the process of mobile payment, consumers have a lot of psychological barriers in the mobile payment, especially the security and credit problems directly blow the desire of consumer, and seriously hamper the rapid development of mobile payment services, and only resolving the question of risk perception, mobile payments can have a greater advantage than the internet. The study [7] through questionnaire survey and analysis to mobile payment users thought that social impact have the most significant positive impact on the use willing of mobile payments, and the expected utility, cost and effort expected have not significantly affect on the use willing of mobile payment, facilitating conditions don?t have significantly affect on the use behavior, the risk perception has a significant positive impact on the use will of mobile payment, and the use willing of mobile payment hast a significant positive impact on the use behavior. The literature [8] using the integration technology acceptance model, analyzed the consumers willing of using mobile payment in six aspects about perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived risk, trust, beliefs and assessment and use attitude, had a certain effect to enhance consumer use willing. The above study did not mention the characteristics of mobile payment user group and potential user groups. It is difficult to determine the target customers market in early development stages in the mobile payment market  This article starts from the development of mobile payment to pay attention to the user groups and the potential user groups of mobile ticket buying lottery tickets and movie tickets and other using mobile phone, uses association rules to data  This paper is sponsored by the Innovative Group Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 70921001)   DOI 10.1109/ICEE.2010.40     mining, analyzes the characteristics of mobile payment users, understands the user perception of mobile payment, demand degree as well as the impact of factors of the mobile payment use of users, so as to provide the basis for  promoting the mobile payment and the determination of the target market mobile payment users.



II. ASSOCIATION RULES OF DATA MINING AND ALGORITHM  A. Principles of Mining Association Rules Association Rules Mining is proposed to describe the rules  of a potential relationship among data items in the database by R. Agrawal in 1993 [9], which is a research direction of data mining (DM) [10-11]. Association Rules Mining can directly express the relationship among item sets (all values of variables) of data. This relationship is not based on a particular distribution of data according to multiple iterations in a specific model, but build on the apparently probability of items in the data information set. Therefore this method is different from the traditional statistical methods; its advantage lies in the clear results and easily explained. In practice, association rules is a process extracting implicit in the work, people unknown before, but potentially useful information and knowledge from a large number , not complete, noisy, vague and random practical application data[12-14]. While the variable types are complicated, the distributions of variables are uncertain and difficult to convert, or all variables are independence, can not meet the requirements of traditional statistical methods, through association rule mining, we can get the information implicit in the variable value.

Set I = {i1, i2, ?, im} is the set of all items, D is the transaction database, transaction T is a subset of items ?T?I ?. Each transaction has a unique transaction identifier as TID.

Suppose A is a collection composed by items, called item-set.

Transaction T contains the item-set A, if and only A?T. If the item-set A contains k items, claimed it as k item-sets. The percentage of the times of Item-set A appearing in the transaction database D hold the total transaction in D is called the support degree of item-set. If the support degree of the item-set exceeds the minimum support threshold value given by the user, then the item-set is called frequent item-set (or large item-set).

Association rule is the logical implicate style in the form of X?Y, in which X?I?Y?I, and X?Y=?. If the transaction database D, there is s% of the transaction including X?Y, then claims that the support degree of association rules X?Y is s%, in fact, the support degree is a probability value. If the support degree for item-set X is denoted by support (X), the trust degree of rules is the support (X?Y) / support (X). This is a conditional probability P (Y | X). Namely: support (X?Y) =P (X ?Y), confidence (X?Y) =P (Y | X). The association rules meeting the minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold are called strong rules, namely association rules. These two threshold values are from 0% to 100%.

Lift is a comparison of two possibilities: one is the possibility of buying the right merchandise in known case of already having purchased goods on the left, and the other one is the possibility of buying the right product under any circumstances.

In this article, refers to the ratio of the success rate of marketing characteristics group and all group to buy movie tickets / lottery business, when choice target customers group, the key is to see the gain value, the gain value is greater that the possibility of using this business is greater. The standard is the same as the selection criteria of other models of data mining, by comparison with the "original" rules of, to measure the predictive accuracy extent of the rules to improve.

B. The Basic Algorithm of Association Rules The Apriority algorithm Based on the theory of frequent  item sets is for association rules of the most classical algorithms [15-16], which is a approach based on the idea of the two-stage frequent set?  the design of association rule mining algorithm is decomposed into two sub-problems: 1) to find all item-sets which support degree is greater than the minimum supports degree, called frequent item-sets; 2) to find the desired rules brought by the frequent item-sets found in the first step. The generation of candidate item-sets is the core of the Apriori algorithm which is for one-dimensional, single- layer, Boolean association rule mining.

It is based on the following properties (Apriority properties): If an item-set is frequent item-set, then all its subsets are frequent item set. Conversely, if a subset of an item set is not frequent item set, then the item set is not frequent item set. The first step of algorithm is to identify all frequent item-sets; step two is to generate the strong association rules by frequent item-sets. First is to generate the frequent first-order item-set L1, then generate the two-order frequent item-set L2, until there is an r value of making Lr is empty, the algorithm stops. Here in the k times cycle, the process first created the set of candidate k-item-set , Ck, each item-set in the Ck is generated by doing (k-2) connections to two frequent item-set belong to Lk-1 which only have one different item. the item- sets in the Ck is used to generate the candidate set of frequent sets, the final frequent item set Lk must be a subset of Ck, each element in the Ck require to be verified in the transaction database to determine whether to join in Lk.



III. ASSOCIATION RULES ANALYSIS OF MOBILE PAYMENT  A. Data Processing In March 2009, the current six areas of China Mobile  payment (bus swipe, mobile ticketing, mobile phone on-site payment, mobile phone online shopping, and mobile phone to pay charge, mobile phone to pay public utility tariffs) are investigated from the user knowledge, user requirements, the situation of use, post-evaluation and future use willing and other aspects. The questionnaire is divided into four parts totally: the preamble, mainly aimed to illustrate the nature and the destination of the survey to the respondents, and to introduce the concept of mobile payment and mobile ticketing  Identify applicable sponsor/s here. (Sponsors)     to the respondents; the first part of the questionnaire includes the screening and classification parts, mainly the screening and classification of the respondents through the provision of the relevant issues; the second part of the questionnaire is the main portion, Mainly on the design of indicators about mobile phone ticketing consumer awareness, demand and willing of use; the third part of the questionnaire is mainly to survey the basic information of respondents about age, sex, occupation, educational level, monthly expenditure, location and brand and others. The survey first carried out a small sample survey of 50 copies, analyzing questionnaire?s reliability and validity using spss, showed that the reliability was 0.812 and the validity is 0.863 which are able to meet requirements, then conducted a large sample survey, a total of 2182 questionnaires were issued and 1626 copies wee recycled, 1615 copies were valid questionnaires. By the association rule analysis, we looked forward to understand the user awareness and demand degrees for mobile payment, as well as the factors of users to pay by mobile phone. This paper selected the most representative mobile phone ticketing of the current mobile payment to analysis. Survey-based data are shown in Tab. I.

Discretely process attributes age, monthly expenditure, data ARPU value and level of education and others of Tab I (packet using data concentration degree as a grouping standards), first the grouping of age: A1 [11-18] , A2 [19-22], A3 [23-35], A4 [36-45], A5 [46-60], A6 [61 years old]; the grouping of monthly expenditures: B1 [100 Yuan below], B2 [101-500], B3 [501-1000], B4 [1001-2000], B5 [2001 above]; the grouping of data ARPU value: C1 [10 Yuan below], C2 [11- 50], C3 [51-100], C4 [101-500], C5 [501 or more]; the grouping of education level: D1 [junior high school and below], D2 [high school], D3 [College University], D4 [graduate], D5 [other]. The results of discretely processing of data attributes are shown in Tab. II.

B. User?s Awareness Analysis of Mobile Ticketing According to question of the survey questionnaire "Do you  know the mobile phone to buy movie ticket / lottery?" To be shown in Fig.1, the statistics of cognition situation of mobile phones to buy movie ticket / lottery. According to the statistics of the cognition situation in Fig. 1, we can see: users very familiar with mobile tickets take up small proportion, about 30% of users understand, most users only heard but do not know the specific features and usage, and even never heard.

This shows that mobile phone ticketing business is under low cognition. Therefore, before the promotion of mobile ticketing in mobile payment, we should open up more channels, increase investment, increase propaganda efforts, and enhance the user?s perception.

According to question of the survey questionnaire, "Which way do you prefer to learn the mobile ticketing of mobile company," we can see from Fig. 2: In the statistical analysis of user answers, selecting " Introduction messages sent by the mobile company's 10086 " and "the publicity / advertising of mobile company's Web site "accounted for the most, followed by" brochures and advertisements of mobile corporate entity operating room or agent "and dialing 10086 to understand, we can see that electronic channels is the favorite of customers of all ages. Therefore, in the publicity of mobile payment business, we should take consumer?s cognitive preferences mentioned above into account, publicize is by the ways which consumers like.

Do you know the mobile phone to buy movie ticket / lottery?4%  29%  37%  30% Very familiar  familiar  Heard before, but it was unclear  Had never heard of it    Figure 1.   Statistics of cognition situation of mobile phones to buy movie tickets / lottery  C. Demand Analysis about Using Mobile Phone to Buy Movie Tickets or Lottery According to the survey data can be: that the user needs and  a great need for 42% and 32% of users do not need to think it may be necessary in the future, there is no need / want to use the business accounts for only 6% of users, its detailed distribution of the situation shown in Fig.3. According to the statistics of the questionnaire, we analyzed the mobile ticketing with association rules, where setting min-sup=10% (minimum support), min-con = 10% (minimum confidence), min-lif = 1(minimum lift), the association rules meeting the minimum support, the minimum confidence and the minimum lift are obtained, as shown in Tab III.

In Tab III, 42% of the user groups who need and really need have the following characteristics: 1) Hunan M-Zone users; 2) monthly consumption expenditure under 100 Yuan users; 3) Hunan users of university education; 4) data services Arup value under 10 Yuan in Hunan M-Zone users; 5) male users in Hunan province. We can see from the above characteristics: geographical and brands are the main recognition factor of this type user; up to 75% of Hunan, M- Zone users think "mobile phone ticketing useful"; it has a great relationship with the use of brand M-Zone users, mostly from universities and younger age groups, targeted at the depth of marketing, so that the user not only think that "useful" but also to "use" mobile phone ticketing.

Do you think it necessary or useful about using mobile phone to buy movie tickets or lottery?  4%  38%  12%  32%  8%  6% Very much needed and useful  needed and useful  May be necessary and useful in the future Not clearly  Do not need now and in the future I do not want to use this    Figure 2.

DATA MINING RESULTS OF DEMAND DEGREE ASSOCIATION RULES  Consequent Antecedent Support % Confidence % Lift  Using mobile  ticketing Hunan and M-ZONE 10.772 75.000 1.553  Using mobile  ticketing  Under expenditure of 100 yuan per month 10.054 69.643 1.442  Using mobile  ticketing  Hunan and College or University 17.774 64.646 1.339  Using mobile  ticketing  Less than Data Services ARPU10 yuan and M-ZONE  11.670 61.538 1.274  Using mobile  ticketing Hunan and male 15.799 61.364 1.271  D. Using Willing Analysis on Buying Movie Tickets or Lottery by Mobile Phones According to the survey data ,we can obtain that under the  situation of meeting the user interest factors, within the next year and may using or certainly using mobile phones to buy movie tickets lottery customers account for 75%, the users definitely not using the business only account for 7% (see Fig 3). According to the statistics of the questionnaire, we conducted the "Mobile ticketing will" association rules analysis, where to setting min-sup = 10%, min-con = 10%, min-lif = 1, the association rules meeting the minimum support (see Tab IV).

In Tab IV, the characteristics of user groups 75% of which will certainly be, and may use in the next year: 1) users with monthly expenditure over 2001 Yuan and aged 23-35 years old; 2) Beijing GSM users; 3) users with expenditures over 2001 Yuan in the Shanghai; 4) expenditures over 2001 Yuan and college-educated employees; 5) the employees with consumption expenditures over 2001 Yuan. We can see from the above characteristics: Monthly consumption expenditure, age, education is the main identifying factors of this type customer,; up to 90.2% at the age of 23-35 years old and expenditures over 2001 Yuan per-month users will use mobile ticketing; this part of the group tended to have relatively higher incomes, young to  have good receptive to new things, it should be targeted at young people in higher income groups for targeted marketing, and then continued to increase customer awareness.

Suppose the factors that you are concerned are  meeting in the coming year,will you choose to use or continue to use  mobile ticketing?

32%  43%  8%  10%  7% Certainly  Maybe  Not clearly  May be not  No    Figure 3.   Statistics of customers willingness in the field of using mobile phones to buy movie tickets sold / Lottery  E. Features Analysis of Users with Low Awareness and High Demand on Mobile Ticketing According to the statistics of the questionnaire, we  conducted the "Low awareness and high demand on mobile ticketing" association rules analysis, where to setting min-sup = 10%, min-con = 10%, min-lif = 1, the association rules meeting the minimum support (see Tab V). According to the users? Features, we can conclude that: 1) Hunan M-Zone users; 2) Data Services ARPU Less than 10 Yuan?s Hunan users; 3) Data Services ARPU Less than 10 Yuan?s M-Zone users; 4) Data Services ARPU Less than 35 Yuan?s M-Zone users; 5) male college-educated M-Zone users. We can see from the above Features: Brand, Region and Data Services ARPU is the main identifying factors of this type customer; While the mobile ticketing business in Hunan have been carried out, but awareness is not very high?so Communication carriers should have to publicize and promote for M-Zone users that the Data Services ARPU is Less than 10 Yuan.

Features Analysis of Users with Demand on Mobile Ticketing According to the statistics of the questionnaire, we  conducted the "with demand but have not used mobile ticketing yet" association rules analysis, where to setting min-sup = 10%, min-con = 10%, min-lif = 1, the association rules meeting the minimum support (see Tab VI). According to Tab VI, the user groups? Features of demand but not use about mobile ticketing about mobile ticketing: 1) expenditures over 2001 Yuan and college-educated employees; 2) college-educated female employees; 3) M-ZONE users with aged 23-35 years old and college-educated; 4) users with monthly expenditure over 2001 Yuan and aged 23-35 years old. We can see from the above Features: Age, monthly expenditure and Education are the main identifying factors of this type customer. Up to 82% expenditures from 1001 to 2000 Yuan per-month and college- educated employee will use mobile ticketing. This type user will become the Potential users about mobile ticketing.



IV. CONCLUSION To find the Specific user groups quickly when marketing in  the mobile payment, this article investigated and analyzed Mobile Ticketing field of mobile payment service from the user's awareness, demand, usage, evaluation after use, willingness of using and so on by using data mining methods of association rules, and also located user groups who most likely to use Mobile Ticketing. It can help the Communication carriers to Market Precisely by quickly locking the market of the target customers at beginning of Mobile Payment Promotion.

The results showed that: mobile ticketing market is still in its early stage; the user?s awareness is low and potential user groups are large; Already the user used or the user wishes to use mostly concentrated in the higher spending and higher educated group of young users. Thus, at the initial stage of Mobile Payment Promotion, the Communication carriers should take into account comprehensively the user's group feature, Simplicity of operation, convenience of Opening and safety of use about mobile ticketing and so on. The Communication carriers should develop a user's perception, let them feel the convenience and practicality and seize the potential users of low awareness by widely publicizing.

Mobile payment market involves bus swipe, mobile ticketing, mobile phone on-site payment, mobile phone online shopping, and mobile phone to pay charge, mobile phone to pay public utility tariffs and so on. This article only explanatorily study on the user groups? features of mobile ticketing. It will be the need for further research about how to record and track existing user groups and potential user groups and how to analyze and compare the user groups? features of the different mobile pay areas.
