Abstract?Due to the complexity of geoscientific data, such as geochemical data, geophysical data and digital remote sensing data, traditional data mining methods, such as cluster analysis and association analysis, have limitations in resources evaluation.

In this paper, a clustering algorithm is presented which has the ability to handle clusters of arbitrary shapes, sizes and densities.

For association analysis, quantitative association rules aims to deal with the relationships among continuous attributes of geoscientific data objects in resources evaluation. An association analysis algorithm based on the distances between clusters projected on attributes is presented. Applications indicate that the algorithms are effective in real world applications.

I. INTRODUCTION In many application domains, such as resources evaluation,  clusters of data objects are of arbitrary shapes, sizes and densities, and the number of clusters is unknown. In such scenarios, traditional clustering algorithms, including partitioning methods, hierarchical methods, density-based methods and grid-based methods, cannot identify clusters efficiently or accurately. Obviously, these are critical limitations or weaknesses of clustering methods. In order to solve these problems, many algorithms have been proposed by many researchers, such as Ert?z, Steinbach and Kumar [1], Ayad and Kamel [2], Ng and Han [3], Ester and Kriegel [4, 5], and Zhang, Ramakrishnan and Livny [6].

Algorithms for discovering classical association rules make different assumptions about the type of datasets to be mined. In general, the dataset is a relational table. The domains of the attributes are restricted to boolean domains. The databases in most business and scientific domains have many types of attributes, including quantitative, categorical or boolean attributes. The classical association analysis algorithms for boolean attributes can not mine quantitative association rules from databases with continuous attributes, and may yield very unintuitive results when applied to continuous attributes.

Srikant and Agrawal [7], Miller and Yang [8], and Aumann and Lindell [9] proposed algorithms to create quantitative association rules.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We present a novel clustering algorithm based on density and adaptive density-reachable in section 2. In section 3, the creation of quantitative association rules based on distance is proposed.

The applications of the algorithms are presented in section 4.

Section 5 concludes with a summary.



II. CLUSTERING ALGORITHM BASED ON DENSITY AND ADAPTIVE DENSITY-REACHABLE  In many application domains, clusters of data objects are of arbitrary shapes, sizes and densities, and the number of clusters is unknown. In order to solve the problem, we proposed a clustering algorithm which has the abilities to find clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes, to handle clusters and noise of varying densities, and to identify outliers effectively. The algorithm is called CADD (Clustering Algorithm based on Density and adaptive Density-reachable, CADD) [10, 11].

A. Relevant Definitions of the Clustering Algorithm (1)The density of data points: Given N d-dimensional data  points in dataset D: {Xi} where i = 1, 2,?, N. The density of data points models the overall density of a set of points in dataset D as the sum of influence function associated with each point:  N  j  XXd  i  ji  eXDensity   ,   Here, Gaussian influence function 2   ,  X, ji XXd  jiGuass eXf  CoefRDmeanR  indicates the density influence of each data points to the density of point Xi, and  is density adjustment parameter which is analogous to the standard deviation, and governs how quickly the influence of a point drops off.

(2)Local density attractors: Local density attractors are the data points at which the values of density function Density(X) are local maximum.

(3)Density-reachable distance: Density-reachable distance is used to determine a circular area of data points x, labeled as ={X| 0<d(Xi, Xj) R}, and the data points in the circular area  are belong a same cluster. The definition formula is:  )(  Here, 2/121 1 1  ))(1()( i N  i i XX  1N Dmean  is the mean distance  between all data points in dataset D, and CoefR (0<CoefR<1)     is named as the initial adjustment coefficient of density- reachable distance.

(4)Density-reachable: Density-reachable means that if there is a chain of objects p1, p2, ,pn=q, q is a local density attractor, and pn-1 is density-reachable from q, then for pi D,(1 i<n-1) and d(pi,pi+1) R, we define that object pi,(1 i<n-1) is density- reachable from q.

(5)Adaptive density-reachable distance: In handling the clusters of varying densities, it is important to adjust the density-reachable distance R step by step during clustering. The adaptive adjustment is carried out through multiplying the original density-reachable distance R with an adjustment coefficient :  RRAdap  Here, RAdap is adaptive density-reachable distance, and  is defined as:  )( )( 1  i  i  AttractorDensity AttractorDensity  )()( 10 AttractorDensityAttractorDensity  )()( 1 ii AttractorDensityAttractorDensity i  This is because that when the density value of local density attractor of a cluster is greater , the distance between objects in the cluster is smaller, and on the contrary, when the density value of local density attractor of a cluster is smaller, the distance between objects in the cluster is larger. When i=1, let  . Because , so 1. It is necessary  to point out that adaptive adjustment coefficient  may also be other value of function which can adjust the density-reachable distance effectively.

X  B. The Clustering Algorithm According to the definitions we design and implement the  clustering algorithm as below:  Algorithm Clustering Algorithm based on Density and adaptive Density-reachable, CADD  Input: Adjustment coefficient of density- reachable distance CoefR, density adjustment parameter .

5: Assign the data objects which are density reachable within adaptive density-reachable distance from ODensityMaxi to cluster Ci, and delete the clustered objects from original dataset.

6:  i i+1 7:  Until Original dataset is empty.

8:  Make the clusters which have few objects (such as less 5 or 7) into outlier or noise group.



III. DISTANCE-BASED QUANTITATIVE ASSOCIATION RULES Association rules that contain continuous attributes are  commonly known as quantitative rules. There are various methodologies for applying association analysis to continuous data. The types of methods mainly fall into three broad categories: (1) discretization-based methods, (2) statistics- based methods, and (3) non-discretization methods. The quantitative association rules derived using these methods are quite different in nature.

The main concept for creating distance-based association rules is to cluster data objects and mine association rules among these projected clusters according to the distances between the clusters.

A. Clustering It is necessary to point out that if there are a number of  clusters in a data space, the strong association rules among attributes just exist in each cluster. Therefore, the creation of association rules just focuses in each cluster. The notion proposed in this section can make the process of quantitative association analysis more simple, efficient and effective.

We use the clustering algorithm CADD to group the data points in a dataset. For a specific set of attributes, restrictions are placed on the properties of these data points when projected on X. For this reason, when a cluster is projected on X, the cluster is denoted as CX. Given N d-dimensional data points { }, (i=1,?,N) in CX, the Clustering Feature [6] is defined as:  ),,( 0 RXN                CF Here, N is the number of data points in CX,  N  i i X  N X  1 is the centroid of CX, and  2/12  ))(1( XX N  R N i i  is the average distance from  member points to the centroid or the radius of CX. According the clustering feature CF, the relationships among clusters projected on attributes are determined as presented later.

B. The Association Rules For a cluster, if association rules exist among the attributes:  X={x1,?,xx} and Y={y1,?,yy}, the definition of association rules is x1 Cx1[x1],?,xx Cxx[xx] y1 Cy1[y1], ?,yy Cyy[yy]. The clusters are labeled with the attributes on which they are projected. For abbreviation, the rule is presented as Cx1,?,Cxx Cy1,?,Cyy, where all the attributes X={x1,?,xx} and Y={y1,?,yy} are disjoint. The rule Cx1,?,Cxx Cy1,?,Cyy holds with confidence c if |( iCxi) ( jCyj)|/| Cxi| c. The rule holds with support s, if |( iCxi) ( jCyj)| s.

For distance-based association rules, the confidence c is determined by the distances among the images of clusters Cx1,?,Cxx and Cy1,?,Cyy, and the support s is dominated by the numbers or densities of clusters. In this paper, we use the     Euclidean distance metric to measure the distance between data points.

According to the notion proposed by R. J. Miller and Y.

Yang [8], the definitions of distance-based association rules are as follows:  Let x1,x2,?,xx and y be pairwise disjoint sets of attributes. A N:1 distance-based association rule (DAR) is a rule of form R: Cx1,?,Cxx Cy, where each Cxi is a cluster projected on xi and Cy a cluster on Y. R holds with degree of association D0 if:  xiDYCxYCyD i 1])[],[( 0  jidXCxXCxD ixjjii 0])[],[(  ])[],[( YCxYCyD i  ||/|][| DsYCyS  ])[],[( YCxYCy  Here, we emphasize that Cy[Y] indicates the Cy Cxi, Cxi[Y] is the image of all data points in the range of Cxi projected on Y, and  is the distance between centroids of Cy[Y] and Cxi[Y]. In real applications, the value of D0 is determined by the radius of the cluster. Because the creation of association rules is in each cluster, it is unnecessary to calculate Equation (7). We define the support S of the association rule as:  Here, |Cy[Y]| is the number N of data points in the cluster, and |Ds| indicates the number of all data points in the data space.

The degree of association replaces the traditional notion of confidence and the density threshold (or the number of data points in a cluster) replaces the notion of support.

In this paper, we focus our research to the N:1 distance- based association rules. N:1 distance-based association rules have a number of important applications. Often in data mining, we are interested in discovering which attributes determine one of a specific set of target attributes. For example, in geochemical applications, there are many chemical elements which are measured in the field, and we have to determine the relationship between a target element and a specific set of elements so as to solve some geochemical problems. Another example is that in medical domain we also have to research the relationships between a specific symptom and other symptoms, and so on.

C. The Association Algorithm  The algorithm presented in this section is a modification of the algorithm proposed in [8], and it includes three phases:  In first phase, clusters in the data space are identified using normal clustering algorithms, such as K-means or CADD [10,11], and the clustering features are calculated.

In second phase, the distances D i  are calculated in a cluster which holds support S, here, Y is the target attribute chosen by domain experts interactively and X={x1,?,xx  0])[],[( DYCxYCyD i ||/|][| DsYCyS  hist, shallow particle rock, and griotte.

} are the other attributes of data points in the data space.

In third phase, the rule is formed by combining the  clusters projected on attribute Y which holds and .



IV. APPLICATIONS In the real world application of data mining techniques, we  use cluster analysis and association analysis to research the regional geochemical characteristics in a region of western China. The sampling area is 80*72 Km2, the distance between sampling points and lines is 2 Km, and the number of sampling points is 1517. The lithological distribution pattern in the region is shown in Figure 1: (1) the pale yellow area indicates humus, anemoarenyte and diluvium in Quaternary; (2) the yellow area is sandy and carboniferous dark gray-colored slate and silty mudstone with siltstone in Dyas; (3) the dark yellow area represents clastic rock, dark gray- colored conglomerate, graywacke, and silty slate with silty mudstone in Dyas; (4) yellow and yellowish-brown- colored granite porphyry, hornblende granite porphyry, and masanophyre in Yanshanian magmatism distribute in the pale pink area; (5) the pink area is flesh and red-colored granitello and medium-grain granite in Yanshanian magmatism; (6) the blue area indicates gray and sage green-colored rhyolite, rhyolitic tuff with breccia in Jurassic; (7) the purple area is dimgray-colored medium and coarse-grain quartz diorite and gneissic quartz diorite in Variscan magmatism; (8) the green area is sage green and pale-gray-yellow-colored biotite plagioclase gneiss with amphibole plagioclase gneiss, quartz sc  Figure 1. Lithological distribution pattern in the sampling region.

The purposes of clustering analysis and association analysis are to research the characteristics of regional geochemical anomalies, to determine the distribution of anomaly source, and to analyze the type of mineral resources according to the relationship among the geochemical elements.

A. Cluster Analysis There are 1443 samples actually in the geochemical  measurement region, and for each sample 17 kinds of chemical elements are measured which are Ag, Al, As, Au, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Mn, Mo, Pb, Sb, Sn, W, Zn. The sampling points constitute a spatial dataset in which each data point has 17 attributes, i.e., Ag, Al, As, Au, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Mn, Mo, Pb, Sb, Sn, W, Zn. The clustering result of CADD is shown in Figure 2. There are four clusters: Cluster1, Cluster2, Cluster3, Cluster4 and Outliers found in the spatial dataset. The     distribution pattern of the clusters is consistent with the lithological distribution pattern in the region, which can indicate the characteristics of geochemical anomaly. The distribution area of Cluster1 reflects the geochemical characteristics of the dimgray-colored medium and coarse- grain quartz diorite and gneissic quartz diorite in Variscan magmatism (the purple area).

B. Association Analysis Geological survey in the field indicates that mineral  occurrences of W and Pb or Cu exist in the area of Cluster1.

According to the geochemical theory [12], the geochemical characteristics of a geological unit can be evaluated using the association rule of the chemical elements. In this section, we use association analysis to analyze the relationship among the chemical elements so as to determine the characteristics of a geological unit, and provide useful knowledge for mineral resource survey.

Because the chemical elements Cd and Sb are important indicator elements for the evaluation of mineral resources, we research the relationships Cd and Sb with other chemical elements using the distance-based association analysis. For Cluster1, when D0=0.005, the quantitative rules are as follows:  (1)The association rule of Cd with other elements:  As [1.4,45], Ag [0.01,0.29], Au [0.3,1.1], Hg [1.0,120], Mo [0.02,4.7], Pb [5.0,56], Sb [0.03,2.78], Sn [0.1,14], W [0,8.7]  Cd [0.01,0.22], D0=0.005, S=33.6%.

(2)The association rule of Sb with other elements:  Ag [0.01,0.29], As [1.4,45], Au [0.3,1.1], Hg [1.0,120], Mo [0.02,4.7], Pb [5.0,56], Sn [0.1,14], W [0,8.7.0]  Sb [0.03,2.78], D0=0.005, S=33.6%.

The association rules indicate that Cd and Sb are related with Ag, Au, Hg, Mo, Pb, Sn and W under certain degree of association and support. According to geochemical theory [12] we can conclude that the mineral resources in the region are related with Ag, Au, Hg, Mo, Pb, Sn and W. The conclusion is  consistent with the real characteristics of mineral resources in the region.



V. CONCLUSIONS The research results may provide new methods and  techniques for comprehensive interpretation of geoscientific data, and minimize the uncertainness and ambiguity of geoscientific data interpretation in resources evaluation. Along with the development of geosciences, more and more data are collected, and data mining techniques have evolved important methods to process huge amounts of geoscientific data and to discover useful geoscientific knowledge efficiently and effectively.
