Discovery of Multivariate Phenotypes using Association Rule Mining and their  Application to Genome-wide Association Studies

Abstract  Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have served crucial roles in investigating disease susceptible loci for single traits. On the other hand, the GWAS have been limited in measuring genetic risk factors for multivariate phenotypes from pleiotropic genetic effects of genetic loci. This work reports a data mining approach to discover patterns of multivariate phenotypes expressed as association rules, and present an analytical scheme for GWAS of those multivariate phenotypes as defining new phenotypes. We identified 13 SNPs for four genes (CSMD1, NFE2L1, CBX1, and SKAP1) associated with low levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C 100 mg/dl) and high levels of triglycerides (TG 180 mg/dl) as a multivariate phenotype. Compared with a traditional approach to GWAS, the use of discovered multivariate phenotypes can be advantageous in identifying genetic risk factors, accounting for pleiotropic genetic effects when the multivariate phenotypes have a common etiologic pathway.

Introduction Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) which examine the correlations between single genetic variants and single phenotypes have contributed to identifying disease susceptible loci [1]. Achievements of recent GWAS have shown that the variants identified capture only a small fraction of the heritability of common diseases despite our broad understanding of genetic architecture of complex traits. Unexplained heritability can be attributed to a lack of reflection on exposure assessment, sample size and heterogeneity [2-4].

Regarding the heterogeneity issue, a bias in case and control samples characterizing a single trait may arise if we assume that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) influences on a single trait without considering genetic nature such as pleiotropy [3, 5]. The pleiotropy  occurs when a single gene influences multiple phenotypic traits. The multiple phenotypic traits are phenotypic associations among single traits. They may be due to association of proximal genetic loci forming a large block of linkage disequilibrium (LD) [6].

In this regard, incorporation of the multiple phenotypic traits to the GWAS can be an alternative way to unravel missing heritability in the GWAS.

Although the GWAS of multiple phenotypic traits can play important role to enhance the power of GWAS, such an approach has not been well pursued.

To detect genetic variants associated with multiple phenotypic traits, application of traditional GWAS approaches has suffered penalties from testing multiple genome-wide markers of single traits. This may reduce the power of GWAS due to elevating impurity and bias in samples. Previous works [5, 7] have shown that GWAS of multivariate phenotypes increase more power than GWAS of single phenotypes separately. In this context, we make an effort to the discovery of novel multivariate phenotypes among a set of single traits and the development of an approach to GWAS of multivariate phenotypes.

Regarding selection of samples [3], one should minimize phenotypic heterogeneity and enrich disease predisposing markers in order to select optimal cases.

Selection of optimal cases for the multivariate phenotypes is more problematical than that of single traits since the genetic architecture of most of them have not been explored much.

Selection of optimal controls is done in a similar manner to that of cases except that controls should exclude latent diagnoses of the phenotypes. It can be true that any loss of power occurred by selection of samples can be recovered by increasing the sample size.

However, the sample size of GWAS has cost constraints.

With large sample sizes of several thousands cases and controls there has been usually limited study power to detect alleles of modest effect sizes (e.g., an odds ratio of 1.20) [2]. Thus, we suggest that optimal selection of both controls and cases for multivariate phenotypes can      improve the outcome of GWAS to explain disease predisposition.

In this work, we present the discovery of patterns of multivariate phenotypes by applying association rule mining to 46 biochemical traits in KARE (Korea Association Resource) population [8]. In addition, we also show an analytical scheme for GWAS of the multivariate phenotypes.  As a case study, we describe the results of GWAS for low levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C 100) and high levels of triglyceride (TG 180).

An association rule which expresses multivariate phenotypes encoding partial correlations between single traits specifies quantitative descriptions of the single traits. Association rules can provide explicit boundaries of the single traits to be used in selection of samples for cases and controls.

Compared with traditional approaches to GWAS, the use of the discovered multivariate phenotypes can take advantages of identifying genetic risk factor accounting for pleiotropic genetic effects when phenotypes have a common etiologic pathway.

2. Methods 2.1 Association Rule Mining The discovery of multivariate traits from single traits is transformed into finding frequent patterns in a set of singleton traits. In our approach we employed Association Rule Mining (ARM) to discover a set of multivariate traits expressed as association rules describing associations among a set of singlet traits.  We have previously shown [9] that association rules detected by ARM are informative and quantitative and have benefits to interpret their meaning.

Association rules have the form R: X ? Y [c, s], where X and Y are the body and the head of a rule, respectively. X and Y are disjoint predicates (X  Y =  ). Each X and Y consists of a conjunction of distinct predicates which describe values of singleton traits. The strength of the association rules can be measured in terms of their support (supp) and confidence (conf). The support of a rule (X ? Y) is the probability that a case in a database contains both X and Y. The  confidence of a rule is the probability that a case contains Y given that it contains X. Note that the head of a rule, Y, is restricted to be one of the traits which we are interested in and X is a set of traits partially correlated with Y. Interesting rules are manually extracted.

2.2 Discovery of multivariate phenotypes Overall process of multivariate phenotype discovery is illustrated in Figure 1.

Discretization of continuous traits ARM is not directly applicable to real valued continuous data such as TG or LDL-C levels. Hence we used discretization to manipulate continuous traits into nominal traits before the ARM process was executed. In this process, continuous traits are divided into five bins expressing extremely low, low, average, high, extremely high values by using equal frequency rather than equal width discretization.

The most of the traits are normally distributed and tend to cluster around their means. Hence, if equal width discretization was applied, bins which include a small number of outliers having values above or below the mean are ignored from final results of association rules.

Therefore, equal frequency discretization was adopted, in order to minimize loss of bins containing the outliers of extreme values of traits.

Figure 1 Work flow diagram  Association rule generation The generation of association rules was carried out employing the APRIORI algorithm [10]. We used 10g Oracle Data Miner (ODM) which implemented the APRIORI algorithm to compute association rules.

Of 8,842 individuals in KARE, 1,853 having missing values were removed. The individuals were described by a total of 52 traits, of which 6 traits extremely distributed were removed. The resulting 6,998 individuals with 46 traits were employed in ARM.

2.3 A Scheme of Association Analysis A multivariate phenotype (y) is defined as bivariate traits (yi, yj)  which can be a mixture of continuous and nominal traits.

y = yi + yj  Association test for multivariate phenotype (y) is performed by following tasks: 1: test for a multivariate phenotype (y): GWAS(y) 2: test for singleton traits: GWAS(yi), GWAS(yj) 3: calculate odds ratio for p values of SNP markers from  association tests of multivariate phenotype over that from a single trait.

ORm= ?? )()(log10 iyGWASyGWAS? 4:  repeat tasks 2~3 for other singleton trait (yj)  Genetic variants associated with a multiple phenotype include SNPs affected by each of single traits which should be excluded.  Tasks 1 to 3 are subject to finding genetic variants influencing phenotype y only and SNPs affecting single traits are removed by ORm test (vide infra). All the association tests are based on comparing allele frequencies between cases and controls.

Strategy for filtering SNPs From results of association test for a multivariate phenotype, SNPs are pruned by the following conditions and significant SNPs remain:  C1: p-value of association test  10-4 C2: ORm 1 C3: p-value of an indexed SNP for a LD < 10-5  and  p value of clumped SNPs <10-4.

The cutoff of p-values for association test of the multivariate phenotype is set to be less stringent than usual GWAS, considering a small sample size for cases and controls due to combination of phenotypes.

ORm 1 means that it is 10 times as likely that SNPs are associated with a multivariate phenotype against a single one.

2.4 GWAS of Low LDL-C and High TG Phenotype description: we interpreted low LDL-C of  100mg/dl and high TG of  180mg/dl from the 49 association rules and defined it as multivariate phenotype lowLDLhighTG. LDL-C estimated from lipid profiles were used. Ranges of TG/LDL-C levels  are adjusted for those meeting the guidelines used in clinical researches.

Case-control analysis GWAS of the multivariate phenotype lowLDLhighTG seeks to identify SNPs influencing both effects of low LDL-C and high TG, while excluding the ones affecting either of the single traits.

Stage1: An association study of lowLDLhighTG at stage 1 was designed for finding SNPs which affected more likely low LDL-C effect among ones having high TG. Hence, 651 cases for low LDL-C and high TG and 545 controls for high LDL-C and high TG were selected for case-control analysis (see Table 2 and Figure 2).

High levels of TG were fixed in the cases and controls but LDL-C levels were compared. Identified genetic variants associated with lowLDLhighTG were pruned for filtering out SNPs affecting LDL-C trait only.

Stage2: An association study at stage 2 was designed for finding SNPs which affected more likely high TG effect among ones having low LDL-C. SNPs influencing TG trait only were pruned from the outcome.

We named association test at stage2 by highTGlowLDL.

Figure 2  Distributions of LDL-C and TG levels  Case-control-based association scans were performed by PLINK [11].  LD clumping for testing LD between the identified genetic makers and haplotypic associations were also conducted by PLINK.

3. Experiments and Results 3.1 Multivariate phenotype Out of a total of 3,792,566 rules generated, we found 10,162 rules that were related to high TG levels. We     found 49 rules that encoded low LDL-C and high TG in contrast to 359 rules that were associated with high TG and high LDL-C levels. Table 1 denotes the representative association rules encoding low LDL-C and high TG. The rules were sorted and selected by their confidences.

The strongest confident rule (Rule 1) is interpreted as 14 % of individuals who have low levels of LDL-C and high levels of nonHDL(High Density Lipoprotein) also have high levels of TG with 100 % probability.  The rules which express low LDL-C and high TG also indicate low levels of HDL (Rules 2 and 3) and total cholesterol (TCHL) (Rules 4 and 6 in Table 1).  These rules informed relationships between plasma lipids.

That is, there are positive correlations between LDL-C and TCHL and between LDL-C and HDL as well as negative correlations between TG and LDL-C, HDL and TCHL.

Figure 3 Relationships between Lipid levels   3.2 GWAS of lowLDLhighTG We investigated 350K variants in 8,512 individuals in the KARE study for identifying their genetic variants associated with multivariate phenotypes lowLDLhighTG and highTGlowLDL, and single traits TG concentrations and concentrations of LDL-C.

Additional details of quality-control and imputation procedures have been reported elsewhere [8]. Gene annotations refer to the human genome build hg18.

We identified 13 common variants in 4 genes (CSMD1, NFE2L, CBX1, and SKAP1) associated with lowLDLhighTG (see Table 3 ).  22 common variants in 7 genes (HECW1, PFK1, SYCP2L, ELOV2, PARK2, and ARG2) were associated with highTGlowLDL.

Details of these loci have omitted in this manuscript due to the page limitation.

Strong associations with trait lowLDLhighTG were detected in the CSMD1 (CUB and Sushi multiple domains 1) gene region of chromosome 8q23.2 (P < 5 ? 10-5, odds ratio =1.44-1.50, MAF > 34 %). Eight SNPs in CSMD1 indicated that strength of associations with the multivariate phenotype lowLDLhighTG were much stronger than that of single trait LDL-C (ORm > 3, ORm=3.3-3.84). The chromosome 8q23.2 in human is hypervariable and contains numerous immune-related genes [12].

A set of association having robust p-values with intermediate effects of SNPs (P < 5 ? 10 -4, odds ratio=2.03-2.38, MAF > 6 %)   were found in SKAP1 (Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein 1) and NFE2L1 (nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 1) which are in the regions of 17q21.32.

The effects of these SNPs were modest and their p-values of association were not notably strong, due to the limited sample sizes.

3.3 Replication Replication analyses were conducted for the 13 SNPs in two regional subcohorts as well as gender groups (See Table 4). The eight SNPs in CSMD1 showed the strong evidence of replication (P < 6.5 10-3) in both regional subcohorts.

All eight SNPs in CSMD1 were more reproducible in males than females.  It is worth to note that rs7839952 have the strongest replication in males.

A previous study [13] addressed the correlations between cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths and all four lipid (LDL-C, HDL, non-HDL, TC) levels. It was observed that males who had the lowest LDL-C level (< 100mg /dl) and high triglyceride value (> 200mg/dl) had increased CVD mortality. In contrast to this, it is known that there is a positive association between LDL-C and CVD mortality.

This clinical evidence supports our premise that lowLDLhighTG trait can characterize the joint effect LDL-C and TG in CVD. Recently, it was reported that SNPs in the CSMD1 gene were also associated with metabolic syndrome [17] and hypertension [14] .

Discussion and Conclusions We discovered patterns of multivariate phenotypes i.e.

phenotypic associations among biochemical traits in KARE using association rule mining. Multivariate phenotypes were expressed as association rules.

Association rules encoded associations between plasma levels of lipids including LDL-C and TG, HDL, and non-HDL. The association rules discovered in our study are in good harmony with the result of numerous studies for CVD [6, 13] that indicate negative genetic correlations between LDL-C and TG as well as between HDL and TG. The plasma lipid levels and relationships between them are well known risk factors for CVD.

We inferred that the association rules encoding lipids implied pleiotropic genetic effect on LDL ?C and TG.

This suggests that common genes contribute to the decrease in LDL-C and the increase in TG.

We showed an approach for GWAS of multivariate phenotypes in order to identify genetic loci influenced by phenotypic associations. Our approach to GWAS of multivariate phenotype lowLDLhighTG, i.e. low levels of LDL-C and high levels of TG, identified 13 SNPs in 4 genes (CSMD1, NFE2L1, CBX1 and SKAP1).

CSMD1 was reported in GWA study of Kawasaki Disease (KD) [15] which is an inflammatory vasculitis affecting young children [16] and associated with serious CVD sequela in adulthood. During analysis of functional relationships between eight KD susceptible loci, Burgner et al identified a single functional network which contained CSMD1. They asserted that KD susceptible loci may also be relevant to other CVD and functionally be related to inflammation and cardiovascular pathology.

The results of our work suggest that four genetic loci associated with multivariate phenotype lowLDLhighTG  can be influenced by pleiotropic effect on LDL-C and TG and be involved in genetic susceptibility to CVD.

The GWAS of multivariate phenotypes are an important alternative to traditional approaches of GWAS considering pleiotropic effects. This work is advantageous in identifying genetic variants associated with traits having a common etiology pathway.
