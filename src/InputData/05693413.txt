Discovering Temporal Features and Relations of  Activity Patterns

Abstract?An important problem that arises during the data mining process in many new emerging application domains is mining data with temporal dependencies. One such application domain is activity discovery and recognition. Activity discovery and recognition is used in many real world systems, such as assisted living and security systems, and it has been vastly studied in recent years.  However, the temporal features and relations which provide useful insights for activity models have not been exploited to their full potential by mining algorithms. In this paper, we propose a temporal model for discovering temporal features and relations of activity patterns from sensor data. Our algorithm is able to discover features and relations, such as the order of the activities, their usual start times and durations by using rule mining and clustering techniques. The algorithm has been validated using 4 months of data collected in a smart home.

I.  INTRODUCTION Activity discovery and recognition has been recently  utilized in many different application domains, such as security and health monitoring of elder adults. Health monitoring of elder adults based on using assistive technologies such as smart homes, has attracted many researchers in recent years due to the increasing aging population. An estimated 9% of adults over age 65 and 50% of adults over age 85 need assistance with their everyday activities.  The resulting cost is significant both for the government and for families. To function independently at home, elderly people need to be able to complete the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) [1] such as taking medication, cooking, eating and sleeping.

Assistive technologies such as smart homes can greatly help in monitoring the activities of elder adults at home. By using a large number of different types of sensors deployed in an everyday setting, and using techniques from activity discovery and recognition, smart homes are able to discover and recognize patterns of resident activities.

Activity discovery and recognition has been vastly studied in the context of smart environments [2], [3], [4] and [6].

Despite the increasing progress in this area, a key component in these activities, namely temporal features and relations, has been largely ignored. One of the few works in this area by Rashidi and Cook [5] provides a method for discovering and  representing basic temporal features of the activities, such as the usual start times at multiple granularities. However, they do not address discovering other temporal features and relations, such as the relative order of the activities. Discovering the order of the activities can be of great use in many different scenarios, such as for predicting the next activity in an activity reminder application or a home automation system.

In this paper, we provide a framework for discovering and representing the temporal features of activity patterns. Our framework called ?DTFRA? (short for Discovering of Temporal Features and Relation of Activities), discovers the usual start times of the activity patterns in form of a normal mixture distribution [7], using a k-means clustering technique [8]. DTFRA discovers a similar representation for duration of activities using a normal mixture distribution. We also discover the order of activities using temporal association rule mining techniques.

The temporal information that is discovered by our algorithms can be beneficial in many different applications.

Here we mention just a few such applications:  - Reminder systems: The discovered temporal information can be used to construct a schedule of activities for an upcoming period. Such a schedule is constructed based on the predicted start time intervals, as well as the relative order of the activities. For example, it can be used as part of an activity reminder system for an Alzheimer patient, in order to automatically generate prompts to remind the patient to initiate activities, if s/he does not follow the usual schedule within the expected start times.

- Anomaly detection: Discovering a confidence level for the order relations, as well as finding the typical start times and durations as mixture models allow us to assign a probability to a particular activity occurring in a given interval. Using the assigned probabilities and using the anomaly detection methods [9], one can exploit such information to detect the any anomalous or suspicious activities.

- Context aware system networks: Last but not least, such information can be used in designing an activity- aware wireless sensor network. Activity aware sensor networks aim to augment wireless sensor network with   DOI 10.1109/ICDMW.2010.164    DOI 10.1109/ICDMW.2010.164     context awareness by taking advantage of the behavioral pattern information such as temporal information. Temporal information allow the sensor networks to act more intelligently by determining which sensors need to be awake at any given time, in order to route data more efficiently with respected to the predicted activities within a given time period.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. First we will describe the related works. Next we will explain our model in more detail, followed by the results of our experiments on the data obtained from an elderly smart apartment. Finally we end the paper with conclusions.



II. RELATED WORK In recent years, the data mining community has observed  remarkable progress in discovering association rules from transactional data. The notion of association rules was first proposed by Agrawal et al. [10] to capture the co-occurrence of items in transaction events. Because a transaction typically includes a timestamp as well as the transaction items, an interesting extension to the concept of association rule is to augment it with the time dimension. This extension suggests that we may discover different rules when different time intervals are considered. As a result, some rules may hold during some time intervals, while not during the others. When we consider the association rules augmented by their temporal intervals, we refer to them as temporal association rules [11].

Activity patterns in smart environments also include a timestamp. The timestamp indicates when a particular activity has occurred, or more specifically when a specific sensor was triggered. Just like the association rule mining, adding the concept of temporal features to the activity patterns can be quite useful, and in some cases necessary. For example, in a home automation system, the concept of time needs to be taken into account to anticipate the time when activities should or would occur. Despite the potential use of temporal features in activity patterns, this key aspect has usually been ignored and it has not been exploited to its full potential. Gottfried et al. [12] mention that reasoning about time and space in smart homes is necessary, because certain things have to be done at certain times and places, and in association with other contexts. Our study goes beyond just highlighting the importance of using temporal features. Here we present a framework to discover and present the temporal features of activities by inferring temporal association rules among different activities. As another related work, Rashidi and Cook [5] have suggested a method for discovering and representing temporal features of the activities. They propose a method for presenting the usual start times of the activities. However they do not consider other temporal features and relations, such as the order of the activities. Galushka et al. [13] also discuss the importance of temporal features for learning activity patterns; however, they do not exploit such features for learning activity patterns in practice. Jakkula and Cook [14] show the benefit of considering temporal associations for activity prediction. Their main focus is on investigating methods based on using Allen?s temporal logic [15, 16] to analyze smart home data, and to use such analysis for event prediction.

In the framework presented in this paper, we will provide a method for discovering various temporal features, and we will present and discuss the results of applying our methods to a real smart home dataset.



III. MODEL DESCRIPTION The architecture of our model called DTFRA is illustrated  in Fig. 1. It consists of two main components: temporal feature discovery, and temporal relation discovery. Each component will be described in more detail in the following subsections.

Figure 1.  DTFRA architecture.

The input to DTFRA is an activity pattern dataset, and its output is a set of temporal relation rules. To make it easier to follow the description of our model, we will consider the ?taking medication? activity as an example throughout our discussions. More activities will be discussed in the Experimental Results section.

A. Activity Pattern Dataset The input dataset consists of a set of individual sensor  events collected from various sensors deployed in the space.

Each sensor event consists of a sensor ID and a timestamp Table I provides a sample of collected data.

Temporal Activity Features Discovery In this study, we consider two temporal features for every  activity: the start time of the activity and the duration of the activity. For this purpose, we extract the start times of every activity instance, and then we cluster the start times to obtain a canonical representation for the start time of a specific activity.

Here we use the k-means clustering algorithm to construct a mixture model for each activity ai. If we denote the start time of an activity instance ai as ti, then the probability that ti belongs to a certain cluster k with parameters ?  = ( , ?), can     be expressed as a normal probability density fu Equation (1).

I. CONCLUSION In this paper, we presented DTFRA for discovering  temporal features and relations of activity patterns. Our algorithm is able to discover features and relations, such as the order of the activities, their usual start times and durations by using rule mining and clustering techniques. These discoveries can be used in many applications, such as developing activity reminder and anomaly detection systems, as well as designing activity-aware wireless sensor networks.
