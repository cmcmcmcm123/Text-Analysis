An Algorithm for Mining Multidimensional  Association Rules using Boolean Matrix

Abstract? In this paper an algorithm is proposed for mining multidimensional association rules. A Boolean Matrix based approach has been employed to discover frequent itemsets, the items forming a rule come from different dimensions. It is an algorithm for mining multidimensional association rules from relational databases. The algorithm adopts Boolean relational calculus to discover frequent predicate sets. When using this algorithm first time, it scans the database once and will generate the association rules. Apriori property is used in algorithm to prune the item sets. It is not necessary to scan the database again, it uses Boolean logical operations to generate the association rules.

Keywords? Boolean matrix, multidimensional association rules, frequent itemsets, relational calculus.



I.  INTRODUCTION Data mining is the analysis of typically very large sets of data in order to discover yet unknown relationships among the data and aggregates them in ways which are novel, useful and understandable to the users of the data. Association rule mining finds interesting association or correlation relationship among a large data set of items.

An association rule is generally in the format: A ?  B, where A and B. These are two distinct sets of items, i.e, ?=?BA . A set of items is called an itemset. A set of k items is called a k-itemset. The main aim of association rule is to find associations among items from a set of transactions, each of which contains a set of items. Generally the algorithm finds a subset of association rules that satisfy certain measures. The most commonly used measures of association rules are : Support and Confidence.

Support: The support of rule A ?  B is defined as percentage of transactions including both A and B (A ? B) in transaction sets. It can be denoted as:  N BAPSupport )()B  A ( ?=?  Confidence: Confidence of rule A ?  B is defined as percentage of transactions including both A and B (A ? B) in transactions that contain A. It can be denoted as:  )( )()(  AP BAPBAConfidence ?=?  An itemset with a support greater than a given minimum support is called frequent itemset. Support determines how often a rule is applicable to a given dataset, while confidence determines how frequently items in B appear in transactions that contain A [6].

Most association rule algorithms generate association rules in two steps: (1) Generate all frequent itemsets, and (2) Construct all rules  using these itemsets.

The basis of such algorithm is the fact that any subset of a frequent itemset must also be frequent, and both A and B in rule must also be frequent. Thus, every frequent itemset of size n can result in n association rules with a single item. The first step is expensive in terms of computation, memory usage and I/O resources. Much of the efforts in association rule discovery have been given to improve the efficiency of this first step. The second step is relatively straightforward, but it can also be very expensive when solving real-world problems.

The discovery of interesting association rules is useful in decision making process. Association rules are usually used to study the relevancy among the different items or attributes.

Association rule, which describes correlations of data items in large numbers of data, is a manner of expressing knowledge.

The first algorithm namely Apriori algorithm [1] was proposed by R. Agrawal and others  [2][3].

Association rules can be classified as single-dimensional association rules and multidimensional association rules on the basis of dimensions appearing in rules[11]. In multidimensional databases, we refer to each distinct predicate in a rule as a dimension. Hence, we can refer to buys (X, ?Digital camera?) ? buys (X, ?HP Printer?) is a single dimensional or intra-dimensional association rule because it contains a single distinct predicate (e.g., buys) with multiple occurrences (i.e., the predicate occurs more than once within the rule). Association rules that involve two or more dimensions or predicates can be referred to as multidimensional association rules. age(X , "20" ) ? occupation (X , "student" ) ? buys (X , "laptop" ), contains three predicates (age, occupation, and buys), each of which occurs only once in the rule. Hence, we say that it has no repeated predicates. Multidimensional association rules with no repeated predicates are called inter-dimensional association rules. We can also mine multidimensional   DOI 10.1109/ITC.2010.8     association rules with repeated predicates, which contain multiple occurrences of some predicates. These rules are called hybrid-dimensional association rules. This  paper discusses mining multidimensional inter-dimension association  rules directly in relational database [15].

To mine association rules in relational database, some authors present a method which transforms relational database into transaction database and uses Apriori algorithm to mine rules.

But the performance of the Apriori  algorithm is not very good. The frequently used methods[14,15] of mining multidimensional association rules with relational database are those which improve the classical algorithms such as , Apriori, and other apriori like using SQL tools [10][12][15]. These algorithms are fast and effective to a certain extent, so they are used in many applications. However, they are not appropriate for mining the same database again and again to acquire more interesting rules than last time, because they cost as much time as last time. To find a solution to this problem, this paper presents a new algorithm that uses Boolean matrix and logical operations on attributes and items.



II. DEFINITIONS  A. Association Rules Definition 1: Let I = {i1 , i2, i3,??. in} be a set of items. D is a database of transactions.  Each transaction T is a set of items and has an identifier called TID. Each T ? I. [9] Definition 2: Association rule is the implication of the form A ? B, where A and B are itemsets which satisfies A ? I , B ? I and A ?  B = ? .

Definition 3: The strength of an association rule can be measured in terms of its Support and Confidence.  Rule A ?B ? is true in D with a support (denoted by ?sup?) and a confidence (denoted by ?conf?), where A and B are  set of items. Support ?sup? is a percentage of transactions including both A and B (A ? B) in transaction sets D. Confidence ?conf? is a percentage of transactions including both A and B (A ? B) in transactions that contain  A.[12] sup = P(A ? B)/|D| , conf = P(B?A)?P(A ? B)/P(A) B. Apriori Property  If an itemset is frequent, then all of its subsets must also be frequent. Apriori is the first association rule mining algorithm for mining single dimension single level  boolean  association rules, which uses support based pruning to systematically control the exponential growth of candidate itemsets [6].

C. Item sets in Multidimensional data set Let RD is relational database with m records and n dimensions. Dimensions, which are also called predications or fields, constitute a dimension combination with a formula (d1, d2, ?, dn), in which dj represents j-th dimension. The i-th record can be expressed as value combination with a formula (vi1, vi2, ?, vin), where vij represents j-th value in i-th record, 1 ?  i ? m and 1 ?  j ?  n.

Definition 4: The form  (dj, vij) is called an ?item? in relational database or other multidimensional data sets, which is denoted by Iij. That is: Iij = (dj, vij), where 1 ?  i ? m and 1 ?  j ?  n [13].

Definition 5: Suppose that A and B are items in the same relational database RD.  A equals B if and only if the dimension and the value of the item A are equal to the dimension and the value of the item B, which is denoted by A=B. If it is not true that A equals B, it is denoted by A ? B.

Definition 6: A set constituted by some ?item? defined in definition 4 is called ?itemset?. The ?itemset? which are constituted by all items in relational database is called ?Full itemset?, and it is denoted by S. That is: S?{Iij  : 1 ?  i ? m and 1 ?  j ?  n }.

Definition 7: Boolean Matrix: is a matrix with element ?0? or ?1?.

Definition 8: The Boolean AND operation is defined as follows:  0.0=0 0.1=0 1.0=0 1.1=1 Where logical implication is denoted by . or AND. If we write C=A.B,  then C can be determined by listing all possible combinations of A and B. Truth  table for logical AND will be:  TABLE  I . AND OPERATION  A B C=A.B 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1   Definition 9: The Boolean ?AND calculus? is carried out to an arbitrary k columns vector of the Boolean matrix; the sum of ?1? of the operation result is called k- support of the k columns vector.

Proposition 1: If the sum of ?1? in a column vector Ai is less than min_sup_num, it is not necessary that Ai  will attend calculus of the next level supports.

Rationale: According to the principle of the Boolean AND calculus, the result is ?1? when the value of all vector elements (in a record) is ?1? [7].

Proposition 2: Itemset A is a k-itemsets (each item belongs to different dimension/attribute); |LK-1(j)| presents the number of values in a dimension/attribute ?j? in all frequent  (k-1)- itemsets of the frequent set LK-1. There is an item j in X. If |LK-1(j)| is smaller than k-1, itemset X is not a frequent itemset [7].

Proposition 3: |LK| presents the number of k-predicate set  in the frequent set LK. If |LK| is smaller than k+1, the maximum length of frequent predicate sets is k.

Rationale: Frequent (k+1)-itemsets X have k+1 frequent k-subsets. If the number of frequent k-itemsets in the frequent set LK is smaller than k+1, there are no frequent (k+1)-itemsets in the mined transaction database.



III. ALGORITHM Let RD be a relational database, m be the number of records  and n are number of dimensions, and min_sup is the minimum support of RD. The minimum support number min_sup_num can be defined as: min_sup_num= min_sup ?m [7].

The algorithm consists of following steps:  1. Transforming the relational database in Boolean matrix.

2. Generating the set of frequent 1-itemset L1.

3. Pruning the Boolean matrix.

4. Perform AND operation on frequent 1-items of  different dimensions to generate 2-itemsets.

5. Repeat the process to generate (k+1)-itemsets from Lk.

A. Transforming the relational database into Boolean Matrix The relational database RD has m records and n  dimensions/attributes. Whereas each dimension has different value combinations or categories. To extract such patterns from relational database, the categorical and symmetric binary attributes are transformed into ?items? [7]. This type of transformation can be performed by creating a new item for each distinct attribute-value pair. Then association rule mining algorithm can be applied.  If there are k value combinations in a dimension then k(k-1)/2 binary items will be created. We set up a Boolean matrix Am*n which has m (are records) rows and n (are different dimension categories) columns. For each record, only one category of each dimension contains the value 1 rest will contain 0.

B. Generating the frequent 1-itemset L1 The Boolean matrix Am*n  is scanned and support numbers of all dimension categories are computed.  The Support number ?sup_num? of Ij  is the number of ?1s? in the jth column of the Boolean matrix Am*n . If sup_num of Ij, is less than min_sup_num, then itemset { Ij } is not a frequent  1-itemset and the jth column will be deleted from Am*n . Otherwise itemset { Ij } is the frequent 1-itemset and is added to frequent one itemset list L1.

C. Prunung the Boolean Matrix Pruning the Boolean matrix means deleting some columns from it. Columns of the Boolean matrix are pruned according to the Proposition 2. This is described in detail as: Let D is the set of all dimensions/attributes in the frequent set   LK-1, where k>2. Compute all |LK-1(j)| where  j?I?, and delete the column of corresponding item j if |LK-1(j)| is smaller than  min_sup.

D.  Generating the set of frequent k-itemsets Lk Frequent candidate k-itemsets are discovered only by AND relational calculus, which is carried out for the k-vectors combination. If the Boolean matrix Ap*q  has q columns where 2<q?n and min_sup_num is h?p?m, (Cq )  k , combinations of k- vectors will be produced. The AND relational calculus computed is for each combination of k-vectors. If the sum of element values in the ?AND? calculation result is not less than the minimum support number min_supt_num, the k-itemsets corresponding to this combination of k-vectors are the frequent k-itemsets and are added to the set of frequent k- itemsets list Lk.



IV. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE An example is given in TABLE II. and the data used in the example is from a relational table shown in  TABLE II. The minimum support for TABLE II is 0.5; m=8 is the number of transactions. Therefore min_sup_num=8?0.5=4.

TABLE  II . A RELATIONAL TABLE (RT)  RID M N O P Q R1 M1 N1 O1 P1 Q1  R2 M2 N2 O1 P2 Q1  R3 M2 N2 O2 P2 Q1 R4 M1 N1 O2 P1 Q1 R5 M2 N3 O2 P1 Q2 R6 M1 N1 O1 P1 Q1 R7 M2 N3 O2 P1 Q2 R8 M2 N2 O1 P2 Q1   1. The relational table RT is transformed into Boolean  Matrix Am*n  as given below .

M          N          O           P             Q     M1 M2  N1  N2  N3 O1 O2 P1 P2 Q1 Q2  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?      Figure 1. A8*11   2. Compute  the sum of the elements value of each column  in the Boolean matrix A8*11 and set of frequent 1-itemset is :  L1 = {{M2},{O1},{O2},{P1},{Q1}} The M1, N1, N2, N3, P2, Q2 columns of the boolean matrix A8*11 are deleted because their support numbers are smaller than the minimum support number.

R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 R8     3. Now perform the ?AND? operation to generate 2- itemsets on these frequent 1-items of different dimensions.

4. The candidate 2-itemsets from different dimensions are {{(M,M2)(O,O1)}, {(M,M2)(O,O2)}, {(M,M2)(P,P1)}, {(M,M2)(Q,Q1)}, {(O,O1)(P,P1)},  (O,O1)(P,Q1)}, {(O,O2)(P,P1)}, {(O,O2)(Q,Q1)}, {(P,P1)(Q,Q1)}}.

5. After performing ?AND? operation for the above inter- dimensional item combinations, we get the support numbers of all the2-itemsets mentioned above.

6. The Boolean matrix A8*9 is generated.

M2.O1  M2.O2  M2.P1  M2.Q1 O1.P1  O1.Q1 O2.P1 O2.Q1  P1.Q1  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?     Figure 2. A8*9   7. Compute the sum of all column elements of Boolean matrix A8*9.

8. Then compare them with min_sup_num, only  the 6th column of A8*9 (O1Q1) is greater.

9. Thus the only frequent 2-itemset is (O1Q1). The algorithm will terminate here because there is no other frequent 2-itemset in the  list L2,  for generating higher itemsets.



V. THEORITICAL ANALYSIS Suppose that  relational database RD has m number of records and number of dimension is n(n<<m), the number of different values of j-dimension is |Vj | and the maximum number of items in one of all frequent item sets is K. Frequent  j-itemsets has |Dj| different dimension combinations. There are |Lj| frequent j item sets and |Cj| candidate j-itemsets. The execution/processing time of the algorithm is divided into following parts:  First part is the time of generating candiadate 1-itemset :for each data e(totally n.m data) . Time consuming is O(n?m?|Vs|), where |Vs| equals to max(|V1|,|V2|, ? ,|VN|).

The second part is the time of performing AND operations on two frequent (k-1)-itemset into a k-itemset: O(k + (k-2)?|Lk-1| + 2m).

Because the first item is much smaller compared with latter two items in the formula, the former formulas can have processing time  O((k-2)?|Lk-1| + 2m). Especially, processing time  in this part will be O(M) if k=2.

The third part is the time of generating frequent k-itemset with candidate k-itemset: O(|Ck|). So, the total processing time when using the algorithm for the first time should be:  O((n.m.|Vs|) + ||2.||).2((  2 k  k  k k CmLk ++??  = ?  Processing  time taken by algorithm after minimum support is adjusted should be:  O(|C1| )+ ||2.||).2((  2 k  k  k k CmLk ++??  = ? )

VI.  EXPERIMENTS To test whether the proposed method is fast, expansible and  effective our experiments are made on machine with Intell ( R) Core 2Duo, 1.5GHz and 1GB memory. The operating system is Windows XP .The database used has 500 records and 11 fields, which have 2~10 different values/categories.

VII. CONCLUSION In this paper, a multidimensional association rule mining algorithm based on Boolean matrix is proposed. The main features of the algorithm are that it scans the database only once, it does not generate the candidate item sets, and it uses the Boolean vector ?relational calculus? to generate frequent item sets. It stores all data in the form of bits, so it needs less memory space and can be applied to large relational databases.
