The Design of a Correlation Analysis Engine Model Based on Carma_VE  Algorithm

Abstract  SOC (Security Operation Center) is the core platform of safety management system, and correlation analysis engine is the core of SOC. This paper designs a correlation analysis engine model. The engine can not only effectively eliminate or reduce duplicate and redundant alerts, but also quickly discover the hidden attack tactics in the huge amount of alerts generated by multi-step attacks. Based on the engine, Carma_VE algorithm is presented in order to automatically generate association rules. Compared with the Carma algorithm, Carma_VE algorithm is more efficient under the smaller training set.

1. Introduction  SOC [1] is a generic term describing part or all of a platform whose purpose is to provide detection and reaction services to security incidents. According to this definition SOC can be distinguished to five distinct modules: event generators, event collectors, message database, and correlation analysis engine and reaction management. In all of these, correlation analysis engine is the most important core component.

At present, with the increasing large scale of network security, SOC is facing the following questions: First, Massive alert events. Second, it is difficult to diagnose problems and loopholes according to alert messages. The number of alerts is so huge that it?s unimaginable to rely on the artificial analysis to discover the correlation relationship hidden in the isolated multi-step attack events [2].

Therefore, in response to these issues, this paper does the following key research: First, The design of a correlation analysis engine model. Second, Carma_VE algorithm was proposed by improving Carma algorithm. Carma_VE can dramatically enhance the efficiency of association analysis through narrowing  mining space, at the same time, it can discover the hidden attack tactics.

2. Correlation analysis engine model  This paper designs a correlation analysis engine model, as shown in figure 1, mainly includes the following four modules: events standardization module, event filtering module, event merging module and correlation analysis module. Besides include merging rules repository, filtering rules repository, triggering conditions repository and association rules repository.

Events standardization module  Main function: different kinds of data gathered from various heterogeneous devices have to be formatted into a ?standard? manner. Through the reference of IDMEF standard, formatted structure of original message is the following table 1  Table 1. Formatted message structure Field Attributes Description evt_id unique Unique message ID alert_id Not null Intrusion type ID src_add Not null Intrusion source host address src_port Intrusion source port number des_add Not null Intrusion target host address des_port Intrusion target port number region_id Not null Unique region id timestamp Not null Time of Intrusion happened  2.2. Events filtering module  Main function: the removal of the original noise data, such as, the alarm information is not complete, lack of IP address or port number and other important information. In the collection of events, let filter some specific alter events according to the filter repository rule and the definition of template, thereby reducing the number of events that the management server must process, as well as, enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of handling events.

2.3. Events merging module  Main function: to merge alarm events so as to shrink the mining space for correlation analysis. As a result of a huge number of alarm event logs be included in SOC, such as the IDS log (per second can produce hundreds or even thousands of incidents), syslog, database log, which contains a large number of duplicate and redundant information, these information for the correlation analysis of events does not have any value [3].

According to the behavioral character, time character and location character of network intrusion events, alert events are divided into three types: First, Repeat event refers to a number of alarms are triggered by only an attack, such as an IP Port scan (scan); Second, Redundancy event refers to frequently alarms for a certain type of attack in a very short period of time, such as SYN flood, many different  forged Ip concurrently connect with an attack target; Third, Concurrent event refers to many different geographical  position of IP attack the same target synchronously, such as DDOS attack , a serious threat at present.

Figure 2 gives an events sample of meeting the first type of merging policy (Repeat event).The alert_id of all the events is 14. In accordance with the merging rule, six events will be merged to generate a super-alert.

In this super-alert record, evt_all_id contains all the merged evt_id numbers; timestamp_range represents the time range of  attack taking place; merge_counts describes the total number of merging original alert event, the greater the value indicates that the greater the possibility of successful invasion.

Figure 2. Example of merging alert events  2.4. Correlation analysis module  Main function: the module was built based on the Carma_VE algorithm. It can effectively narrow mining space and limit the length of the sequence of frequent, besides can support dynamic, real-time mining of association rule for alarm events. Thus achieved two main function, First, automatic learning and auto- update of association rules repository. Carma_VE is able to accurately mine the frequent sequences hidden in a variety of attack. Second, by taking advantage of mined frequent sequences, the model can generate strong association rules to achieve early warning function.

Here is an example of correlation analysis about alert events. Set Min_Support = 50%, Min_Confidence = 50%.

First step, through correlation analysis for the former 15 alert events in the Figure4, let?s get a strong association rules form. Precede presents the precondition of attack sequence, and Consequent presents the final result caused by the attack sequence, as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Strong association rule form    Second step, when collecting the 16th incident, according to the existing rule t the attacker will do the Udp flood attack in the next step. This forecast has 100% confidence. As shown in Figure 4.

eardrop Udp flood?  Figure 4. Example of attack warning  3. Carma_VE algorithm description  Carma_VE algorithm is proposed based on the Carma algorithm. Carma would be able to dig out all the frequent sequence set in compliance with the threshold of Min_Support and Min_Confidence through scanning twice in the database transaction set.

It can be divided into two phases: Phase I, to find out all the frequent itemsets which enough to content Min_Support. Phase II, to generate strong association rules from all the frequent itemsets. These rules must be able to content   Min_Support and Min_Confidence.

Carma_VE mainly improve the Phase I of Carma in the following two aspects:  On the one hand, according to the Apriori important properties "The all nonempty subsets of a frequent itemset must be frequent" [4], when the length of frequent sequences is n, the frequent itemset will contain 2  frequent items. Therefore in dealing with massive data, the frequent sequence length will seriously affect the speed of the algorithm.

1n ?  Based on in-depth study of attacks in the network security, a successful invasion usually contains the following five steps, Hidden IP address=>Footprinting and Scanning=>Access to the system or administrator privileges => Cultivation of back door=> Stealth in the network. According to this characteristic, to limit the length of itemset v which will be inserted into a frequent itemset collection V in Phase I. Set the longest frequent attack sequence's length is 5, that is  .| | 5v ? On the other hand, as is well known, the important  conclusion of Association Rule, "Support of a itemset is always less than or equal to support of its subset" [5].

However, Carma did not take full advantage of the conclusion in Phase I. Observed the execution, we can  find that if a itemset v contained k elements is inserted into frequent itemset collection V, it would at least going through k times transactions,. The condition of inserting is following [6]:  :   ( )   ( ) iw v w V and firstTrans w i and maxSupport w ?? ? ? < ? According to the above analysis, the condition that v is inserted into V can be weakened by preferable using the important conclusion. Just to check all the proper subset w in v at first, the number of elements in w only smaller one than the number in v. The inserting condition can be changed,  :| | | | 1    ( ) ( ) i  w v w v and w V and firstTrans w i and maxSupport w ? ? ? = ? ? <  ? The Pseudocode of Phase I in the Carma_VE algorithm is following, Input   :  ?attack sequence in database  1 2( , ...., )nT t t t= ?support sequence  1 2 ( , , ...., )n? ? ? ?=  Output:V?the frequent itemsets collection  i  i  Begin V:={ }; maxMissed(v):=0;firstTrans(v):=0;count(v):=0; for i from 1 to n { //1)Increment for all v V with v t {count(v) ;}  //2)Insert for all v t  and |v| 5 with  ?  ? ? ++  ? ?  i  v V {  if  w v: |w|=|v|-1 and w V and firstTrans(w)<i and maxSupport(w)  then  {   V:=V {v};   ?  ?  ? ? ?  ?  ?  i-1 1  firstTrans(v):=i; count(v):=1;  maxMissed(v):=min{ (i-1)avg ( ) +|v|-1,  maxMissed( i  ? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?  i  w)+count(w)-1 |w v}; } if |v|= =1 and maxSupport(w) then  {V:=V {v};firstTrans(v) : i;maxMissed(v):=0;} } //3  ?  ?  ?  ? =  i  i  )Prune if(i % max{[1/ ],500}==0) then  {V:={v V|maxSupport(v)  or |v|= =1}  } return V; End  ? ?? ?    4. Experiment and Analysis Taking these two Experimental results we can see:  Carma_VE algorithm enhance the overall efficiency of association rule mining, as a result of it limit to the subset length of current transaction and optimize the condition that itemset v is inserted to frequent itemset collection V.

Carma and Carma_VE algorithms were achieved by using Java Data Mining API. And then the performance was compared through experiments. The experimental data was collected in a week's invasion alarm events of the campus network. A total of data is 5000 (TD=5000).

5. Conclusion Experiment 1: In the condition of the same number of transaction events (TD = 5000) and the different support, to compare the execution time of two algorithms. As shown in figure 5, the result demonstrate that the smaller with the support, the longer consumed Carma algorithm for the implementation, but the time growth rate of Carma_VE algorithm for the implementation required much lower than the Carma.

According to the features of SOC, designed and implemented a correlation analysis engine model based on Carma_VE algorithm. The engine model has filtering, merging, correlation analysis and early warning functions, so as to significantly improve the efficiency of mining time, achieve real-time analysis for the massive alarm events and forecast the next step of attacker. The engine has already been used in the practical project and has a good effect in application.
