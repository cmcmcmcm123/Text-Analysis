Key words-A priori algorithm; UML; Java Implementation; Agile Design Principles  I . INTRODUCTION  Data Mining, also known as knowledge discovery, is the main research of database and artificial intelligence, and association rule mining is an important data mining research model. Association rule mining can find the meaningful inter-mining and unexpected association from a large number of items. These association rule can provide valuable information on a variety of decision-making, although the association rules is accompanied by the rapid development of the retail industry, but it is not only in commercial applications, but also in computer hardware, speech synthesis , network security and other fields.

Various existing association rule mining algorithm can be divided into search algorithms, hierarchical algorithms, data set partition algorithm, and the sampling algorithm.

Apriori is the most famous association rule mining algorithm, which is proposed by R. Agrawal and so on.

This paper gives the UML class design diagram by the design principles of agile, and selects the popular OOP language Java to achieve. In practical applications, it can be used in a variety of data application by object-oriented language achieved.



II. THE MODEL OF ASSOCIATION RULES  Set I = (ih i2 . . .  im) is the set of all projects, D is the  transaction database; transaction T is a project subset (T ? I). Each transaction has a unique transaction identifier-Tid.

Set A is a key set which is consisted of a collection by the project. Transaction T include A items set, if and only if A  ? T. If the item set A contains k items, claimed it as "item  set k". The total number of the percentage of item set A occurs in the transaction database D is called item set support. If the item set support given by the user more than the minimum support threshold, we say the set is the    frequent item sets [1].

Association rule is the logical implication type of the  form X => Y, XCI, YCI, and X n Y = 0. If s%  transactions contain X U Y in transaction database D, we  claims that association rule X => V's support is s%. If the degree of support for item set X denoted support (X), then  the rules of trust is support (X U Y) / support (X). As: support (X => Y) = P (X U Y); confidence (X => Y) = P (Y / X).

Association rule is the rule of support and trust meet the threshold given by the user. Discovery of association rules need to implement the following two steps: (1) Identify all the frequent item sets; (2) Generated the trust rule by the frequent item sets to meet the minimum threshold.



III. THE THOUGHT APRIORI ALGORITHM  Apriori algorithm has great influence in the field of mining. It was derived from algorithms using a priori nature of frequent item sets (Prior) knowledge. Apriori association rules algorithm includes two steps: First, through iteration, retrieve a transaction database of all frequent item sets, which support is not less than the threshold set by the user item set; the second step is using of frequent item sets to construct confidence to meet the minimum rules for the user. A potential frequent item sets followed the principle of "a subset of frequent item must be frequent item" and " the superset of non-frequent item sets must be non-frequent." Specific steps are[2,3]:  (1) Through a single trip to scan the database D to calculate the support of a set of individual, finds the set of Ll that is from the frequent item.

(2) Connection Step: In order to generate the Lk set that is from frequent k item sets, set collection Ck of potential frequent k item sets is generated. The set of potential frequent item sets is obtained by the JOIN  operation. If (p, q E Lk-1), P = (Ph P2, P3, ... , Pk-2, Pk-l), q = (qh q2, q3, _ . _ , qk-2, qk-l), and When (1:Si<k-1), Pi = qi; when(i=k-1), Pi-l:;fqi-h then P U Q = (Ph P2, P3, . _ . ,  Pk-2, Pk-h qk-l) is the Ck elements of potential frequent k item sets.

The Ck elements of potential frequent k item sets may become the collection of item sets that compose of the frequent k item sets.

(3) Pruning step: Since Ck is a superset of Lk, there    may be some elements are not frequent. When Ck is a huge amount of computation, in order to reduce the size of Ck, Apriori comply with the following property: any non-frequent (k-l) is not a subset of frequent item sets. So when one of the potential k item set (k-l) is not a subset of the members of the Lk-h then the potential frequent item sets can be frequent and can be removed from the Ck. This is the Apriori pruning thought.

(4) Through the single scan database D, calculating the support of various item sets in Ck.

(5) Removed the set that is not meet the minimum support from Ck, generated the Lk set that is from the frequent k item sets.

Through the iterative loop, repeat the above steps 2-5 until no new frequent item sets generated in the collection date, Apriori algorithm is obtained to meet the minimum support of all frequent item sets.



IV. THE IMPLEMENTATION BASED ON AGILE PRINCIPLES  Apriori association rules algorithm is two steps: first, through iteration, retrieve a transaction database of all frequent item sets, which support is not less than the threshold set by the user item set; the second step, use of frequent item sets to construct confidence to meet the minimum rules for the user[ 4].

A The principles of agile design  In the design process of optimization of the Apriori algorithm, we should fully take into account the principles of agile design[5,6]: (1) OCP (unified and open principles); (2) LSP (Liskov substitution principle); (3) SRP (single responsibility principle); (4) ISP (Interface Isolation principles). The results of the design were shown in Figure 1.

The results of the design   B According to the principles of agile design (1): Design of an abstract class "Associator class"  It is designed for the parent class of all the association rules mining algorithms. There are many association rule algorithms, such as Apriori, AorioriTid, FP-Growth and so on. All of these algorithms are the subclass of Associator class. It has three main methods:  (l)Void generateAssociations(Instances data); I*create the main method of association rules, association rules parameters to generate the initial data set of all the records set *1;  (2)Void forName(String associatorName,String[] options); 1* abstract class Associator used to obtain a subclass objects, parameters for the child class object to generate the required string parameter array *1;  (3)Void makeCopies(Associator model,int num); I*get the current number of copies Associator instance, num indicated that the number of copies *1.

C According to the principles of agile design (2), (3): Design of the Apriori class  Apriori class inherits Associator class and implements the Aprior algorithm. The introduction of the beginning of Apriori association mining algorithm, the user can set the number of rules you want to generate. First of all, according to a given minimum support for mining association rules, if the number of rules generated is less than the given number will be given a minimum support to reduce the amount each time, and a new round of excavation, until the resulting number of association rules is not less than the number specified by the user or until the limit has been reduced to a minimum[7 ,8,9].

The following are the key members of the Apriori class:  Double minSup, minCon; II Minimum support, minimum confidence  Double upperMinSupport; IIUpper limit of minimum support  Double 10werMinSupport; I I The lower limit of minimum support  Double variation; IIMinimum support changes in the value of each iteration  Vector allRules; liThe resulting set of association rules, stored in the vector  Instance instances; liThe set of association rules of data items by user The following are the key methods of the Apriori class:  setOptions(String[] options); IISet all the parameter values  generateAssociations(Instances instances); IISatisfy the minimum support to generate all the frequent item sets, and then from these to generate the association rules to meet the minimum confidence.

findLargeItemSets(Instances instances); IIGenerate minimum support of the frequent itemsets  findAllRules(Vector rules); IIGenerate all association rules    D According to the principles of agile design (1), (4): designed "AprioriInteiface" interface and "ItemSet" class  The "AprioriInterface" interfaces, "ItemSet" class used to store the item sets generated in the association rules mining process, as well as connects item sets and pruning operations, and generate the corresponding frequency set.

The following are the key members:  int[] Items; IIUsing an integer array to represent Item sets  int count; liThe number of transactions of the items set to change  int totalTransactions; liThe total number of transactions The following are the key methods:  confidenceForRule(ItemSet precondition, ltemSet consequence); IIGet the confidence of association rules  containedBy(Instance instance); IICheck the instance in the current item sets  sortitembySupport(Vector attributes); II Rank the item set according the size  deleteItemSets(Vector itemSets, int minsup); IIRemove all items that does not meet the minimum support set  generateRules( double mincon, Vector hashtables, int  numItemsInset); IIGenerate the association rules that meet the minimum confidence  mergeAllItemSets(Vector itemSets, int size, int totalTrans ); IICombined K-1 item sets and generated the K item set  pruneltemSets(Vector toPrune, Hashtable kMinsOne); IIPruning on the K item set by checking the frequent items ofK-1 item set.
