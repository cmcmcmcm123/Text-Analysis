Application of Data Mining to Anthropometric

Abstract-In this paper, data mining technology is applied to study on dependency relationship between height and main  feature points of body. The association rules are extracted by  using Linear Regression algorithm. Before scanning feature  points, the location of each feature point is predicted by data  mining technology, and then feature points are scanned  preferentially within corresponding locations. This will greatly  reduce the search range offeature points; thereby enhance the  efficiency of photogrammetry.

INTRODUCTION  In fashion design, pattern design, in order to better fit  the body, it is important to study the proportion of the human body, size, structure and other information. Only deeply study the data of body, can pattern design be processed suitably. Garment designed and made to  individual specifications demands to obtain anthropometry data. The convenient and fast methods of  anthropometry are a focus in garment made-to-measure field [1]. Photogrammetry is typical case which first obtains the contours of the human body from few photographs, then detects feature points in the contours  and finally calculates the body size of various parts on the basis of rules derived from statistical analysis of  mass anthropometric data. The technique of detecting feature points is the key step in procedure of human photogrammetry. The efficiency of feature point  identification determines the efficiency of the human body photogrammetry. In this paper, data mining  technology is applied to study on dependency relationship among the feature points. The rules between them and the height are extracted. This will greatly reduce the search range of feature points; thereby enhance the efficiency of photogrammetry.

2. PROCESS AND RESULTS  2.1. Designing Model of Data Warehouse    In our study, nine feature points are selected which are associated with many size of the human body III vertical dimension. They are defined as follows [2]:  ? vertex: the highest point of the first top  ? cervical height: point of the seventh spinous process tip of cervical vertebrae  ? acromion: the most prominent point located at the lateral border of the acromion  ? anterior armpit: the most under endpoint of the pectoralis major, located in the front split of armpit  ? fossa jugularis: the midpoint on the straight-line  portion connected to two sternal end of clavicle  ? thelion: the center of the nipple  ? waist height: the vertical distance from waist line to ground  ? hip height: the vertical distance from hip line to  ground  ? knee height: the vertical distance from knee line to ground.

According to research purposes, logical model of anthropometric data warehouse is built, which can be used to uncover and predict hidden patterns between  nine feature points and the height. The logical model of this data warehouse consists of one data table named Survey, which is defined as Fig 1:    Survey number: int height: float vertex : float cervical_height: float  !ii acromion: tloat ? anterior_armpit: float 1??sSajUgUlariS : float ?thelion : tloat I?iwaist_height : float ? hip_height: tloat ?? knee_height : float  Fig. 1. Logical Model of Anthropometric Data Warehouse  After the data collection, data cleaning and transformation are completed, there are 259 samples in the data warehouse which are anthropometric data of male and scattered throughout China.

2.2. Selecting Tool of Data Mining  There are hundreds of data mining tools and softwares.

In our study, we selected Microsoft SQL Server 2005 as the data mining tool. Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services contains the features and tools which can create complex data mining solutions. A set of industry?  standard data mining algorithms meet the demand of study. The function module of Data Mining Designer  can help user to create, manage, explore, and create predictions from mining models [3].

The Microsoft Linear Regression algorithm is a typical algorithm which is a variation of the Microsoft Decision Trees algorithm, where the MINIMUM_LEAF _CASES parameter is set to be greater than or equal to the total number of samples in the dataset that the algorithm uses to train the mining model. When the parameter is set in this way, the algorithm will never create a split, and therefore performs a linear regression.

Linear regression can be used to determine a relationship between two continuous columns. The relationship takes the form of an equation for a line that best represents a series of data. For example, the line in  the following diagram is the best possible linear  representation of the data [4].

Fig. 2. Diagram of Linear Regression  The equation that represents the line in the diagram takes the general form of y = ax + b, and is known as the regression equation. The variable Y represents the output variable, X represents the input variable, and a and bare adjustable coefficients. Each data point in the diagram has an error associated with its distance from the regression line. The coefficients a and b in the regression equation adjust the angle and location of the regression line. The regression equation can be obtained by adjusting a and b until the sum of the errors that are associated with points reaches the lowest number.

In our study, we use linear regression to uncover and predict hidden patterns between height and 9 feature points.

2.3. Model Building of Data Mining  Model building is the core of data mining, though it is not as time-and-resource-intensive as data transformation. Only the type of data mining task is completely understood, it is relatively easy to pick the  right algorithms. According to our study purpose, linear regression algorithm is suitable.

Indicating column usages in the Data Mining Wizard    In indicating column usages, which columns we specify as input and which as predictable are shown in  Fig 3.

2.4. Model Assessment of Data Mining  Lift chart is a popular tool to evaluate the quality of a model, which uses a trained model to predict the values of the testing dataset. Based on the predicted value and  probability, it graphically displays the model in a chart.

Lift chart shows the overall performance of the model  across all possible target states. In this version, a line coordinate indicates how many predictions would have  gotten correct by the used model. The ideal line here is  at a 45-degree angle, indicating that if the data had used 50%, about 50% of the population would have been  correct, or if the data had used 100%, the population would have been correct all the time. The random guess  line is based on the most likely state discovered in the training set.

2.5. Prediction  Prediction is also called sconng m data mmmg  tenninology. To give predictions, a trained model and a set of new cases are need. In our study, finding patterns  is just half of the work; the final goal is to use these models for prediction.

The Mining Model Prediction Builder pane allows building and editing prediction queries. In order to demonstrate the predicting function only two columns are selected to predict. The results are shown in TABLE 1.

CONCLUSION  This paper describes the application of data mining to anthropometric surveys for gannents. Our study uncovers and predicts hidden patterns within the data of  body feature points. From figure 5, we can draw a conclusion that there is dependency relationship between  height and 9 feature points. As we mentioned at Section D, the relationship can give us ideal prediction. We can predict the position of the 9 feature points according to  the height.

Fig. 5. Dependency Network  The conclusion can be used to detect feature points of body. Before scanning feature points, the locations of each feature point are predicted by data mining    technology, and then feature points are scanned preferentially within corresponding locations. This will greatly reduce the search range of feature points; thereby enhance the efficiency of photogrammetry.
