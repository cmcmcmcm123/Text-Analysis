Sequence Pattern Discovery of Events Caused by Ground Fault Trips in

Abstract In this paper, sequences of events registered in  power distribution systems are analysed using pattern sequence  discovery algorithms. The events considered in the study are  basically voltage sags generated by homopolar faults and reg-  istered by power quality monitors installed in the secondary of  transformers in distribution substations. The events registered  in a measuring point have associated the time of occurrence,  and the list of increasing-time ordered events corresponds to  a sequence. The aim is to discover existing temporal patterns,  or episodes, that occur sufficiently often along that sequence.

Sequence pattern discovery algorithms are used to discover  those frequent episodes. Then, frequent episodes are used to  obtain association rules that describe relationships between time  spans of successive events. The method has been tested with  data from gathered in different substations.



I. INTRODUCTION  The failures of components in power distribution systems  can have a great impact on the reliability and continuity  of electricity supply to the customers [1]. Some faults are  caused by conditions external to the network operation  (accidents, weather conditions, animals, etc.) but others are  produced due to degradation of components such as wires,  insulators, surge arresters, etc. The last, can be analysed  as predictable events of the power system produced by  a degraded behaviour of some components [2]. Different  methods and strategies to predict the performance of the  network in fault conditions and to identify disturbances  associated to possible failures at an early stage are being  proposed recently [3], [4] and [5]. This work is also in this  direction and proposes the use of sequence pattern discovery  algorithms to characterise sequences of events frequently  occurred in the power system for its further analysis.

Events are phenomena which only happen once in a while  and can be described by parameters as depth and duration  (voltage sags). To describe sequences of events we need  also to include the time between consecutive events in the  description (all of these parameters in stochastic sense) [1].

Voltage events (interruptions, transient overvoltage and  voltage sags) are the main class of events. But only voltage    sags are used n this work. Origin of voltage sags is variate  but they can reflect faults occurring in the power distribution  system [1] and are characterised by a reduction in the supply  voltage magnitude (depth) followed by a voltage recovery  after a short period of time (duration). According to IEC, a  O. Quiroga, J. Melendez and S.

Sanchez is with Endesa Distribucion SLU, Barcelona, Spain  jorge.sanchez@endesa.es  supply voltage dip is a sudden reduction in the supply voltage  to a value between 90% and 1% of the declared voltage,  followed by a recovery between 10 ms and 1 minute later.

For the IEEE a voltage drop is only sag if the during-sag  voltage is between 10% and 90% of the nominal voltage.

In the presence of damages, multiple events can be gen-  erated due to the actuation (automatic and manual) of the  protection system during the fault, which isolates and locates  the area where it has been originate. Consequently pattern  sequences described by those faults can be diverse. In case  of auto-extinguishing faults, the number of successive events  generated will be lower than when there is a permanent  damage according to the number of times that the protection  system operates (opening and reclosing) trying to clear the  fault. Typically those events are being registered in huge  databases containing rich information describing network  operation and performance. So, in the paper we explore the  possibility to exploit this information for forecasting failures  and improving knowledge about electricity networks.

The aim is to automatically identify sequences of events  associated with the same fault. Then, the existence of these  sequences permits to compare protective system actuation  in several substations of power system. Table I shows typ-  ical reclosing settings (automatic and manual coordination  strategies) for a distribution network with overhead and  underground lines. Reclosing strategy depends on the line  to protect; in this case there are four options for reclosing to  the same number of line types as shown in the bottom of the  Table I. Then, the goal consists in applying pattern discovery  algorithms for finding the frequent time spans between  successive events and to associate them with possible fault    trips. Then, those frequent episodes can be used to verify the  consistency of settings of the protection system with respect  to those described in Table I. In this work, the frequent  episode discovery framework proposed in [6] has been used  to discover those temporal patterns where frequent episodes  are temporal patterns that occur sufficiently often along to  a single long sequence. Once such frequent episodes are  known, association rules [7] can be obtained to predict the  apparition of future events, with a minimal confidence level.

At this moment, these prediction rules are useful to obtain a  simple representation of how protective system is performing  in order to assist process understanding and further work is  being conducted to obtain failure forecasting rules.

Table II exemplifies the representation of successive  events recorded in the database for a measurement point.

Each logged event has three main attributes: t begin is the  date of occurrence of the event; devent is the duration of  the event; pevent is the depth of the voltage sag generated  by the event and corresponds to the percentage that the rms  voltage value decreases during the event.



II. RELATED WORK  Development of automatic strategies for dealing with  power quality monitoring problems (disturbance recognition  and classification, failure analysis and forecasting, fault lo-  cation, etc.) in power distribution systems are actual topics.

An extensive review and formulation of problems related  to power quality, focusing primarily on voltage sags and  interruptions is reviewed in [1]. Incipient fault detection and  analysis of failures is a recent topic of great interest for the  development of predictive maintenance policies of the elec-  trical system. For example, in [2] abnormal and intermittent  variations of voltages and/or currents are studied to early  recognise the apparition of those incipient faults. The idea  of analyzing the evolution of incipient faults is introduced  in [2] and [8]. The idea is to isolate parameters that can  predict failures of components.

is used in [3]. ANNs are employed to monitor the states of  some components in power networks, such as switchgear and  transformers with the aim of to detect and alert the operator  before a catastrophic fault actually occurs. Fault distribution  modeling for the stochastic prediction of voltage sags in  power networks are developed in [4] and [5] with the goal  of predicting the performance of the power network under  transient conditions. A fault diagnosis model, based on data    mining of sequences of events (SOE), for fault diagnosis of  high-voltage transmission line systems (HVTLS) is presented  in [9]. SOE is a log that records the signals and alarms  produced by the protection systems and the proposed model  makes use of spatio-temporal characteristics contained in  the SOE logs. Fault diagnosis of power systems identifies  faulty components based on the real-time alarm information  occurred in accidents.

The approach in this paper is different because it focuses  only on voltage events. Sequence pattern discovery algo-  rithms will be used with this purpose. Pattern discovery  in sequential data has been widely applied in different  fields (financial series, alarms in communication networks,  sequences of queries in databases, sequences of customer  transactions, etc.) but never to characterise and predict faults  in power systems. The common goal in those domains is  to automatically discover interesting patterns according to  different criteria [10]; but depending on the nature of the  data, the identification of patterns can follow different ap-  proaches. For example, if the dataset consists of a collection  of sequences containing different items, the task may be to  discover ordered subsequences of items that occur in many of  these sequences (sequential patterns [11]). On the other hand,  if the dataset consists of a unique and extensive sequence,  the task may be focused on discovering temporal patterns  that occur many times throughout the sequence (frequent  episodes [6]). This approach has been used for mining of  data from assembly lines in manufacturing plants [12] and to  analyze neurobiological data [13] under some explicit time  constraints with respect to the original approach. Another  exiting approach is based on the assumption that in an event  sequence there are events at each time slot in terms of  various intervals (hours, days, weeks, etc.) such sequences  must satisfy more complex representation [14].

The most suitable approach for this work is to consider  episodes in event sequences. Two algorithms called WINEPI  and MINEPI were developed for frequent episodes discovery  ([6]). Later on, the algorithms MINEPI+ and EMMA were  proposed to extend previous algorithms for episode mining  from complex sequences ([14]). WINEPI algorithm fits better  the problem of recognizing episodes in sequences of voltage  events under certain adaptation we will explain later.

A. Search Episodes  According to the terminology developed in [6], given a  set E of event types, an event is a pair (A, t) where A is  a type of event, A ? E, and t is its time of occurrence.

The event type can contain different attributes. A sequence  of events s can be expressed as (s, Ts, Te), where s =   ?(A1, t1), (A2, t2), ..., (An, tn)?, Ai ? E for all i = 1, ..., n,  ti ? ti+ 1 for all i = 1, ..., n? 1, Ts is the beginning time  of the sequence and Te is the ending time of the sequence,  being Ts ? ti < Te for all i = 1, ..., n.

The objective is to find within the sequences all the  frequent episodes of a particular class. The events in an  episode must occur close enough, being the user who decides  how close must be the events to be part of an episode. This  decision is made by defining a time window. A time window  is an event sequence w = (w, ts, te), where ts < Te and  te > Ts, and w consists of pairs (A, t) from s, where  ts ? t < te. The time span te?ts is the width of the window  called win. A window can be seen as a slice of an event  sequence and, then, an event sequence can be viewed as a  sequence of partially overlapped windows. According to the  previous definition, the first and last windows on a sequence  extend outside the sequence, so that the first window contains  only the first time point of the sequence, and the last one  contains only the last point. With this definition an event  close to either the beginning or the end of a sequence is  observed in the same number of windows as an event in the  middle of the sequence.

An episode is a collection of partially ordered events  occurring together. The frequency (fr) of an episode is the  number or fraction of windows where the episode occurs.

The user must specify the minimum frequency (min fr) to  consider an episode as frequent. Frequent episodes may be  of several classes: serial episodes, when events occur strictly  in that order in the sequence; parallel episodes, where the  relative order of events in the sequence is not restricted, and  non-serial and non-parallel episodes, which can be seen as  a combination of serial and parallel episodes. Fig. 1 shows  an example of an event sequence and the different classes of  episodes represented as directed acyclic graphs. The episodes  are built iteratively, starting from events and subepisodes    which also must be frequent. It is defined that an episode  ? is a subepisode of ? if the events of ? also belong to ? in  the same partial order of ? and the events of ? are connected  to all events of ? that are not in ?. An example of this type  can be seen in Fig. 1.

B. Association Rules  According to [7], the problem of finding association rules  falls within the purview of databases mining, also called  knowledge discovery in databases [15]. Association rules  describe the connections between events in a given sequence  and are obtained from frequent episodes [6]. For instance,  if the episode ? showed in Fig. 1 is a subepisode of ?, and  ? occurs in 5% of windows, i.e. fr(?) = 5%, and ? occurs  in 4% of windows, i.e. fr(?) = 4%, it can be estimated  that after appearing events A and B in a window, there is a  possibility of 0.8 to obtain the event C in the same window.

The fraction fr(?)/fr(?) is the confidence of the rule, conf,  and can be interpreted as the conditional probability that the  entire episode ? occurred in a window if a subepisode ? has  occurred in it.

III. PATTERN DISCOVERY IN SEQUENCES OF  EVENTS  As mentioned above, concepts of the algorithm WINEPI  are used to discover frequent episodes in the time span  between successive events monitored at the same point of  measurement in the power network. Our initial interest is  related with serial episodes found in the sequence of events.

A. The Considered Features of Events  The sequence of events consists of registers of voltage  sags, monitored at the same point of the distribution network  during a period of time. These registers should be sorted by  their dates of occurrence. Elapsed times between successive  events are calculated in order to create a new sequence  consisting of the time spans between successive events. Next,  the values of the sequence of time spans are discretized to  form the sequence of nominal values. Then, the frequent  episode algorithm will be used to find the frequent time  spans. Other attributes of events are not considered in this  work. Table III shows the intervals used to discretize the  time spans based on those listed in the Table I (intervals  highlighted) and other relevant time intervals.

The time window definition has been slightly modified to  consider a fixed certain number of successive events instead  a fix time. Only serial episodes with occurrence frequency  (fr) greater than the minimum frequency (min fr) defined  by the user are searched. Next, those frequent serial episodes  found, are reinterpreted as association rules that describe  the relationship between events. Only association rules with  a confidence (conf) greater than the minimum confidence  (min conf) threshold have been considered.



IV. TEST OF THE PROPOSED SOLUTION  As it has been commented before, the database has records  of events registered at different points of the network (trans-  former substations). The tests and results obtained following  the proposed methodology are presented in detail for one  of these monitored points in the system and then the most  relevant results from the analysis of all data points are  summarized.

Table IV shows some of the consecutive events measured  at one point of the distribution network. The events are  duly organized and classified according to the proposed   TABLE III  INTERVALS OF CLASSIFICATION TIME SPAN BETWEEN  SUCCESSIVE EVENTS  time span type intervals  [1] t?1 s  [2] 1 s ? t ? 10s  [3] 10 s ? t ? 20s  [4] 20 s?t?50 s  [5] 50 s?t?100 s  [6] 100 s?t?5 min  [7] 5 min?t?10 min  [8] 10min?t? 30min  [9] 30 min?t? 2 h  [10] 2 h?t? 5 h  [11] 5 h?t? 1 day  [12] 1 day?t? 2 days  [13] 2 days ?t? 5 days  [14] 5 days ?t? 15 days  [15] t?15 days  solution. The first column (index) contains the order of the  registers in the sequence according to the events occurrence    date, t begin, which is showed in the second column. The  third column displays the duration of the event and the  fourth column, interval, show the lapse times between  successive events. Lapse times are calculated by subtracting  the beginning time of the event (column 2) from the ending  date of the previous event (column 2 + column 3). The fifth  column of the table contains the time span type assigned to  the interval according to Table III. The complete sequence  of events (lapse times) is shown in Fig. 2. In this figure  only appears information related to the index and the event  type. There are 50 events and 11 event types. Considering  a window with a width, win, equal to 5 events, a minimum  frequency, min fr, equal to 0.15 and a minimum confidence,  min conf , equal to 0.5, there are three frequent episodes of  length 2, which are shown in Table V.

Table V also shows the frequency (support) of the  subepisodes and episodes. This information is needed to  construct association rules. Episode ?1 relates events due to  the same fault. This episode appears in the sequence of events  due to faults that causes multiple events (minimum 3 events  due to same fault). According to the ?1 stage automatic  reclosing protection system occurs frequently. ?2 indicates  that often the difference in time between consecutive events  or faults is several days. ?3 related events occurred with a  time difference of a few hours, these events indicate manual  operations of the protection system for the normalization of  a failure (events due to same fault) or to be random events,  self-extinguishing. Fig. 2 shows the frequent serial episodes  found in the event sequence (Table V).

Table VI shows the rules found with confidence greater  than 0.5 from frequent episodes shown in Table V. In general,  the rules show the relationships among events more clearly  than the frequent episodes on their own. The first rule shown  in Table VI indicates that if two events have a time span  less than 1 s, one may expect with a confidence of 0.75 that  there will be a third event within 50 s to 100 s following the  second one. Similarly, the second rule indicates that if two  TABLE IV  CHARACTERIZATION OF EVENTS FOR A MEASUREMENT  POINT  index t begin devent timespan(s) type  (ms)    2007-09-22  8 12:28:11,145 1081 225,005 [6]  2007-09-22  9 12:31:57,231 501 7.084,555 [9]  2007-09-22  10 14:30:02,287 1001 2.475.453,203 [15]  2007-10-21  11 06:07:36,491 881 118.172,890 [12]  2007-10-22  12 14:57:10,262 760 5.554.033,531 [15]  2007-12-25  13 21:44:24,553 862 2.233.236,727 [15]  2008-01-20  14 18:05:02,142 1100 0,520 [1]  2008-01-20  15 18:05:03,762 1340 60,030 [5]  2008-01-20  16 18:06:05,132 1119 10.699,748 [10]  2008-01-20  17 21:04:25,999 1181 4.260,432 [9]  2008-01-20  18 22:15:27,612 1080 2.029,349 [9]  2008-01-20  19 22:49:18,41 1040 4.104,130 [9]  TABLE V  FREQUENT EPISODES WITH THEIR CORRESPONDING  FREQUENCY  episode fr  ?1 = [1] 0.37736  ?3 = [9] 0.32075  ?2 = [15] 0.54717  ?1 = [1? 5] 0.2830  ?2 = [15? 15] 0.2642  ?3 = [9? 9] 0.1698  consecutive events with a time span between 30 min and 2 h,  one may expect with a confidence of 0.5294 that there will  be a third event within 30 min to 2 h following the second  one. Rules represent connections between events and allow  the prognosis for the future development of similar events.

Results show that, for the analyzed sequence of events, fre-  quent episodes contain about 50% of all the events recorded  at that point in the network. Likewise, association rules    relate approximately the 34% of the events, which enables  the forecast of new events that are the same type as those  contained in the rules. In a similar way to the presented case,  we analyzed 62 different measurement points with a total of  6300 events occurred in the distribution network over 2 years.

The parameters used to  extract the association rules are win = 5, min fr = 0.15  and min conf = 0.5. The summary showed in Table VII  indicates that the ranges of occurrence of events in each  measurement point presents different behaviours and, there-  fore, it is necessary to examine separately the sequences of  each measurement point for a successful development of  a valid prediction. The results show that it is possible to  build rules to relate time spans between successive events,  which give an estimate of time lag for the appearance of  a new event. Although it is not possible to relate all the  events of the sequence, the knowledge of network behavior is  improved, and takes advantage of power system information  available in databases. Finally, different values of win,  min fr and min conf were tested to find frequent episodes    and association rules. The result show that increasing win,  larger episodes can be found, while increasing min fr and  min conf the amount of frequent episodes and rules will  be minor, since the requirement for selection increases.

Similarly, it was found that using WINEPI methodology, the  frequency of an episode is proportional to the width of the  window. The appropriate values of min conf and min fr  are defined taking into account criteria such as sequence  length, type events frequency and the confidence threshold  that the user wishes to assume. It is advisable to test different  values of min conf and min fr.



V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS  The proposed methodology suggests a new approach for  failure analysis in power distribution system. The aim of  the solution is the forecast of faults, which is analyzed in  the domain of temporal data mining and, in particular, the  discovery of patterns starting from the registers of events.

The proposed solution is able to extract useful information  about the behaviour and evolution of the faults in the  electrical system, as a first step in the exploitation of event  sequences recorded in power distribution systems, for the  prediction of future failures.

Future work should continue with the search of episodes in  sequences of events to discovery patterns related with failures  in components and to exploit other information contained in  the events recorded besides the elapse times between events,  e.g., the depth of voltage sags during the fault, etc. Next use  this information from a predicting point of view, to anticipate  future failures.
