I. INTRODUCTION The agricultural land evaluation developed from the researches on soil inventory for estimating yield, soil nature, and soil fertility, to management and evaluation of land resource integrated land with environmental factors and human factors [1].  To make evaluation result reflect the quality of land  and the change of land-use, and afford better quality of service for land use and land plan consequently, some land evaluation algorithms have been proposed. Hu took Zhejiang Province as the study area of red soil, applied red soil resources information system to classify the RSR types [2]. Shen designed several sampling distributions based on the whole training sample distribution to study the spatial variety of soil properties using BP neural network ensemble [3]. Damjan used machine learning methods including model   * Corresponding author.

Other methods,  such as Decision Trees [5], ANN [5], Support Vector Machines [5], Decision Support System [6], and Immune Algorithm[7], are also be used to evaluate land resource.

Although these impersonal methods are effective, the knowledge representation of land evaluation is limited. The algorithms of extracting rules, which could improve the intelligibility and efficiency of the land evaluation knowledge, are represented. Generally speaking, association rules between sets of items in large databases can be mined by data mining technique such as Apriori Algorithm. Algorithms are proposed by researchers for mining or extracting rules.

The methods Hisao Ishibuchi etc. [8, 9, 10] extended demonstrated that the generalization ability of linguistic rules is less sensitive than the choice of a discretization method and the number of rules than that of standard association rules.

In order to improve the intelligibility and efficiency of the land evaluation knowledge and to reduce the complexity of the land evaluation models and to improve the efficiency and intelligibility of fuzzy classification association rules further, an algorithm to eliminate redundant rules for obtaining the simplified fuzzy classification association rules is presented.

In addition, considering the challenge of a few samples that are difficult to classify the process of fuzzy decision, an iterative algorithm for grouping fuzzy decision for datasets is discussed.



II. SIMPLIFIED FUZZY CLASSIFICATION ASSOCIATION RULES AND GROUPING FUZZY DECISION  A. Parameters for mining algorithm The most important parameters for mining algorithm  include Support and Confidence.

Suppose an attribute  set 1 2{ , , , }mI A A A= ?   and a  transaction database 1 2{ , , , }nD d d d= ? ,the expression for Support and Confidence of fuzzy association rules  A B? could be defined as [11]: Support ratio of fuzzy association rule:     ( ( ) ( ) ) Support (A B)=  A B A B d D  d d  D  ? ? ?? ? ?  ? ?  ? (1)  Confidence ratio of fuzzy association rule: ( ( ) ( ) )  Confidence (A B)= ( ( ) ( ) )  A B A B d D  A A d D  d d  d d  ? ? ?  ? ? ?  ? ? ?  ?  ? ?  ?  ? ?  (2)  Where ?  is a user-prescribed threshold,  | |D  denotes the number of transaction in D , x? is the membership class denoting how much it belongs to x ,  ( ) min{ ( ) | } ix x i  d d x X? ?= ? , ( ( ) ( ) )x x d D  d d? ? ? ?  ?? is the sum of set   belongs to x bigger than denoted ?  .

The weights, which are calculated by land evaluation experts, can be utilized directly.

B. Generate fuzzy classification association rules Once the Support and Confidence are calculated by the  equation above paragraphs, fuzzy classification association rules can be extracted by the algorithm the following paragraphs motions.

Mining fuzzy classification association rules is a 2-step process:  1. Mine fuzzy classification association rules and partial association rules from the frequent itemsets. Find all frequent itemsets, which occur at least as pre-determined minimum Support.

2. Simplify the fuzzy classification association rules.

Checking the redundant rules generated from the frequent itemsets.

Indeed, the smaller the minimum Support is, the more the frequent itemsets are, and the more complexity of the algorithm is. Fuzzy classification association rules can be extracted from the frequent itemsets, while the rules satisfied minimum Support and minimum Confidence. Partial fuzzy association rules can be obtained in the process of the algorithm at the same time. Partial fuzzy association rules can be utilized to describe the relationship among all the factors or a certain factors, as well as the relationship between some factors and the classification of land resources. The rules, on the one hand, can help the land evaluation experts to analyze the relationship among all the factors or a certain factors, as well as the relationship between some factors and the classification of land resources, on the other hand, some fuzzy classification association rules with strong intelligibility can be utilized to construct a classifier to evaluate the land resources.

C. Fuzzy decision One method for land resources is fuzzy decision based on  fuzzy classification association rules. Customarily, it doesn?t need the character of the samples entirely match with the standard pattern, but to estimate which standard pattern the  character that is the most approaching to, then belong to it.

Thus, a land evaluation method combining fuzzy classification association rules with fuzzy decision is proposed in this paper. Concretely, based on the theory of concept fuzzy matching degree and the method fuzzy inference, calculate the fuzzy degree of the test samples matching to the fuzzy classification association rules, then find the maximum fuzzy matching degree and select which rule corresponding to, the classification of the rule is the result of the test samples, i.e. the classification of the land resources.

Fuzzy membership function includes Gaussian curve membership function, Bell curve membership function, Trapezoidal membership function, Triangular membership function and Sigmoid curve membership function and so on.

Gaussian curve membership function is selected as the membership function in this paper. The membership of fuzzy subsets F   for the element of universe is shown as:  2( ) exp[ ( ) ]F x cx? ? ?= ?   (3)  In which ?   is variance, c  is value of center.

For the reason it?s simple and effective to calculate by  using maximum membership function criterion multiplication-product method, the method is selected to calculate the fuzzy degree of the test samples matching to the fuzzy classification association rules. In the process of fuzzy matching, the mathematics expression of fuzzy matching for the j th rule is shown as:  1 1  ( ) ( ) exp[ ( ) ] k k  i Fji  i i  x cFd j x? ?= = ?= = ?? ?   (4)  In which k  is the quantity of factors, Fji?  is the membership of the test samples based on the  j th rule and i th factor, ?  is variance, c  is value of center, ( )Fd j   is multiplication-product of  i th factors based on the j th rule.

Find the maximum fuzzy matching degree and select which rule corresponding to; the classification of the rule is the result of the test samples. The mathematics expression of maximum membership of l  fuzzy classification association rules is:  max ( )  j l FD Fd j  < < =   (5)  D. Simplify fuzzy classification association rules Redundant items exist in the frequent items potentially;  redundant rules exist in the fuzzy classification association rules at the same time. The redundant rules increase complexity of land evaluation models and decrease efficiency and intelligibility of fuzzy classification association rules.

To make a premise that guarantee the accuracy of fuzzy decision can not be reduced, the rule simplifying method of is to check the self-accuracy of the rules, the process of simplifying is:     Step1: Sort fuzzy classification association rules in ascending order by the principle of Support, and define threshold of the removable rules;  Step2: Eliminate the first fuzzy classification association rule from the repository, and the new repository is formed.

Make a fuzzy decision of all the test samples by using the new repository eliminated the first fuzzy classification association rule. If the accuracy of fuzzy decision is not decrease or less than the threshold of the removable rules, the rule can be eliminated, and the new repository is preserved. If the accuracy of fuzzy decision is decrease or more than the threshold of the removable rules, the rule must be preserved, and the repository is restored by the repository before eliminating the first fuzzy classification association rule.

Step3: Eliminate the second fuzzy classification association rule from the initial repository. Notice, in despite of the first fuzzy classification association rule is eliminated or not, the repository contains the first fuzzy classification association rule. Then, estimate the second fuzzy classification association rule is eliminated or not in the manner of Step2.

Step4: Go to Step2 and Step3, in this manner, until the last fuzzy classification association rule is estimated.

E.  Grouping Fuzzy Decision When using the algorithms fuzzy decision, the situation that the same product may obtain by largest degree of membership under the simplified fuzzy association rules, so that the largest degree of fuzzy matching rules corresponding to more than one rule, resulting the classifier can not even match rules to the testing samples. Therefore, the grouping fuzzy decision algorithm is discussed in this paper, that is, dividing the entire database into two data sets, including sole fuzzy decision data sets and non-sole fuzzy decision data sets, the samples contained in sole fuzzy decision data sets can be evaluated only by simplified fuzzy classification association rules; the simplified fuzzy association rules are extracted again from the rest samples by resetting another minimum Support when the samples of non-sole fuzzy decision data sets are evaluated by fuzzy decision. If the non-sole data sets in the fuzzy decision are still difficult to evaluated, divide the data sets into another sole data sets and non-sole data sets, then use the same method again iterative, and so on.



III. EXPERIMENT Database had been selected from the database of Second  General Soil Survey Database of Guangdong Province, and 16652 records of samples were selected, which are related to the agriculture resources. The influence factors altitude (EL), slope gradient (SL), soil pH (pH), organic matter content (OM), soil texture (TE) and land utilization type (LU), can be classified the parameters into five fuzzy sets. And classification of soil resource that can be mainly classified into 4 subsets, Class I, Class II, Class III and Class IV.

Fuzzy classification association rules and partial fuzzy association rules can be obtained after mining the database of Second General Soil Survey of Guangdong Province. Partial  fuzzy association rules can be utilized to describe the relationship among all the factors or a certain factors, as well as the relationship between some factors and the classification of land resources.

Set user-prescribed threshold ?  =0.6.



IV. RESULTS Fuzzy classification association rules and partial fuzzy  association rules can be extracted using fuzzy association rules. Fuzzy association rules are effective, not only to discover the partial rules among the land evaluation factors or the partial rules between the land evaluation factors and the land evaluation results, but also to extract convenient intelligible land evaluation classification rules from training samples.

Fuzzy classification association rules can be utilized to describe the relationship between all the factors and the classification of land resources. Set min_support=0.01, 19 fuzzy classification association rules can be extracted.

Results of land evaluation method combining fuzzy classification association rules with fuzzy decision are shown as Table 1. In order to compare the results with different minimum supports, the correct rate of quantity and area is collected statistics. For instance, while setting the minimum support is 0.01, 19 fuzzy classification association rules can be extracted, 12836 samples and 1.369766E+5 kmP2 P are evaluated correctly, take 77.0838% and 78.8791% percentage of total quantity and total area respectively.

The experimental results of Table 1 indicate that the quantity of rules increases with increasing the accuracy of fuzzy decision, which is logical to the truth. The experimental results also indicate that the algorithm combining fuzzy classification association rules and fuzzy decision is resultful to reduce the complexity of the land evaluation models, improve the efficiency and intelligibility of fuzzy classification association rules, reduce dependence on experience of land evaluation domain, and a satisfactory accuracy can be obtained.

However, redundant rules that exist in the knowledge base composed of fuzzy classification association rules are discovered in the process of operation. In order to reduce the complexity of the land evaluation models and improve the efficiency and intelligibility of fuzzy classification association rules further, an algorithm to eliminate redundant rules is proposed above. Specially, an experiment for simplifying is accomplished in the case of minimum support is equal to 0.005.

Five models in different pattern are utilized to test entire records of database by using fuzzy classification association rules shown as Table 3. In the first row of Table 2, "Original Model" denotes the fuzzy decision result of fuzzy decision using 32 fuzzy classification association rules as knowledge base extracted in the case of setting minimum support is equal to 0.005. Fuzzy classification association rules are sorted in order of first appearance of the record in the database. "Sorted Model" denotes the fuzzy decision result of fuzzy     classification association rules are sorted in order of Confidence on the base of "Original Model". "Simplified Model" denotes the fuzzy decision result of using 23 simplified fuzzy classification association rules after simplifying the knowledge base of "Sorted Model". In order to compare with three models, fuzzy decision result of 32 simplified fuzzy classification association rules is calculated.

79 simplified fuzzy classification association rules are obtained after simplifying 126 fuzzy classification association rules extracted in the case of setting minimum support is equal to 0.001. "Adjusting Model" selects head 32 simplified fuzzy classification association rules sorted by confidence of 79 simplified fuzzy classification association rules as knowledge base.  ?Grouping Model? improves the efficiency of the non-sole fuzzy decision data sets when the samples are difficult to evaluate.

The experimental results of Table 2 indicate that in the case of selecting 32 fuzzy classification association rules as knowledge base, "Grouping Model" gets the best accuracy in  five models. "Sorted Model" and "Adjusting Model" provide higher precision with the area accuracy improved by 1.5202% and 3.8989% to "Original Model", and the knowledge of "Simplified Model" eliminates 9 redundant rules, provide higher precision with the area accuracy improved by 1.8562% to "Original Model" only using 23 simplified fuzzy classification association rules. Notice, the area accuracy of "Sorted Model" and "Simplified Model" is almost the same, because "Simplified Model" only removes the redundant rules, but the model is less complexity. It's significative for improve the efficiency and intelligibility of the rules.
