An improved similarity measure method in  Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Algorithm

Abstract?Collaborative filtering recommendation technology is successfully used in personalized recommendation services.

Since the magnitudes of users and commodities in E-commerce system has increased dramatically, the user rating data in the entire item space become extremely sparse. There is a certain deviation while using traditional similarity measure methods, which reduces the recommendation accuracy for the recommendation systems. To overcome the shortages of the traditional similarity measures under such conditions, this paper proposes using similarity impact factor to improve similarity measures in collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms.

The experimental results show that the factor can effectively improve the similarity measure result while user rating data are extremely sparse, and significantly improve the accuracy of the recommendation systems.

I. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION With the rapid spread of the Internet and the rapid  development of E-commerce, it is becoming more and more urgent to obtain the required information quickly and efficiently from the mass data. Providing recommendation service for users is applied to a variety of portals and E- commerce system increasingly, which functioned as collecting users? historical information to learn their interests and behavior patterns and analyze their behavior.

Collaborative filtering technology is very broadly used in the recommendation system, which includes User-based Collaborative Filtering [1] and Item-based Collaborative Filtering [2]. This technology is based on the nearest neighbor, and the recommending form concludes Rating Prediction [3] and Top-N recommendation [4,5]. Tapestry is the first collaborative filtering recommendation system proposed, which records users? views after reading articles, each user should explicitly point out the users who have the similar behavior [6]. GroupLens [7], Ringo [8] and Video Recommender [9] are also earlier collaborative filtering recommendation system, which provides recommendation service for films, news, music, by analyzing other users? views.

With the constant expansion of E-commerce system, all kinds of problems exist in the recommendation system about data  sparsity [10], cold start [11], scalability [12]. Cold start problem is the extreme case of data sparsity, which cannot be completely avoided. Random recommendation [13] and popularity-based recommendation methods [14] are mainly methods to deal with the cold start problem. Random recommendation method has a broader coverage but poor user experience. Popularity-based recommendation methods can solve the problem better, but it is not individual and cannot solve the Long-tail. In the case that the rating data are extremely sparse, the accuracy of the traditional similarity measure methods depends on the number of common rated items, which leads to the result that the nearest neighbor of target users and items are inaccurate, and the recommendation quality?s decline. In order to solve the data sparseness problem, matrix dimensionality reduction based on collaborative filtering method is proposed in [15,16], which would lead to the lost a lot of relevant information and the result is not satisfactory. In reference [17], a collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on item rating prediction is proposed, which firstly predict the user's score of the ungraded items based on the similarity among items and then fill the item-score matrix, so that the target user's nearest neighbor can be calculated out and the target recommended is achieved. Due to the use of traditional similarity measurement methods in preliminary score prediction, which cannot measure the similarity between items or users, then the subsequent calculation is affected, at last, the entire recommendation quality would have a decline. To eliminate the error of the similarity measurement, using correlation weight factor to calculate the similarity is proposed in [18,19], and then influence weight is proposed in [20], Reference [21] improves the similarity measure method by comparing certain threshold with the number of common rated items.

In this paper, an improved similarity measure method for collaborative filtering recommendation Algorithm is proposed after studying the problems in traditional similarity measurements in the case that the users? rating data are extremely sparse. Based on the measure method on items and users, it is proposed to use similarity impact factor to improve the similarity measurement and the improved method is used to predict the rating of ungraded items. The experimental result shows that the similarity impact factor can rectify the deviations existed in the traditional similarity measure method  *Corresponding author   DOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.39    DOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.39     when the data is extremely sparse effectively and the entire quality of recommendation algorithm is improved. In section 2, the traditional similarity measure methods are summed up and the measure result is analyzed in the case that data is extremely sparse. In section 3, the main content of the improved similarity measure method in Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Algorithm is presented. In section 4, experiments on the similarity impact factor and the recommendation algorithm and the experimental analysis are showed. In the end, summary of this paper is presented.



II. SIMILARITY MEASURE METHODS AND ANALYSIS  In recommendation systems, user rating database consists of n  users { }1 2, , , nU U U U= ? , and m  items { }1 2, , , mI I I I= ? . User rating data can be represented as a n m?  user-item rating matrix, denoted by ( )R n m? , where n  denotes the n  users, m denotes the m  items. Let ,a iR  be the rating of user aU  on item  iI  ( ),a iU U I I? ? , which reflects user?s interests and preference for the item.

The similarity between pairs of users or the similarity between pairs of items is used to predict the user?s rating on the item in collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms, which can be measured based on the users or items. The accuracy of the similarity measures determines the quality of the recommendation system. Let ( ),a bsim U U  be the similarity between user aU  and user bU . Firstly we need to get all items that be rated by aU  and bU and calculate the similarity between them by different similarity measure methods. Similarly, let  ( ),i jsim I I  be the similarity between iI  and jI , so that all the users? rating on the item iI  and the item jI  can be obtained.

The ( ),i jsim I I  can be calculated according to the users? rating.

A. Similarity measurement methods The similarity can be calculated between pairs of users or  pairs of items. Among the most commonly used traditional metrics we have: Cosine-based Similarity, Adjusted Cosine Similarity and Pearson Correlation Similarity [22, 23]. In this paper, we set the similarity between users as an example to introduce traditional metrics.

1) Cosine-based Similarity In Cosine-based Similarity, we regard the user rating or the  item rating as the rating vector, where the rating of the item that didn?t be rated by the user is assumed to be 0. The similarity between users or items can be measured by calculating the cosine of the angle between vectors. The smaller is the angle, the higher is the similarity. Let ,a bR R  ??? ???  be the rating vectors of the user aU  and user bU  on the m dimension space of the items. The similarity between user aU and user bU  can be expressed as follows:  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )  , ,  2 2  , , 1 1  , cos ,  m  a k b k a b k  a b a b m m a b  a k b k k k  R R R Rsim U U ine R R R R  R R  =  = =  ? = = =  ?  ?  ? ?  ??? ?????? ??? ???? ???  (1)  Where ,a kR  denotes the rating that user aU  rated on the item kI .

2) Adjusted Cosine Similarity To adjust the deviation between different users? different  rating scales in Cosine-based Similarity metric, Adjusted Cosine Similarity improves the result by subtracting the average rating of the user rating on items. Let  a bU U I  be the set of  the common items that the user aU  and the user bU  rated. aUI and  bU I  respectively denote the set of items which user aU  and  user bU  have rated. The similarity between the user aU  and the user bU  can be expressed as follows:  ( ) ( )( )  ( ) ( )  , ,  2 2  , ,  , U Ua b  U Ua b  a k a b k b k I  a b  a k a b k b k I k I  R R R R sim U U  R R R R  ?  ? ?  ? ? =  ? ?  ?  ? ? (2)  Where ,a kR  denotes the rating that user aU  rated on the item  kI , aR  and bR  denote the average rating of the user aU  and bU respectively.

3) Pearson Correlation Similarity Correlation Similarity metric measures the similarity  between pairs of users or pairs of items on their mutual rating and amends the deviation between different users rating scale.

Let  a bU U I  be the set of common items that user aU  and user bU  have rated. The similarity between user aU  and user bU  is measured by Pearson correlation coefficient as follows:  ( ) ( )( )  ( ) ( )  , ,  2 2  , ,  , U Ua b  U U U Ua b a b  a k a b k b k I  a b  a k a b k b k I k I  R R R R sim U U  R R R R  ?  ? ?  ? ? =  ? ?  ?  ? ? (3)  Where ,a kR  denotes the rating that user aU  rated on the item  kI , aR  and bR  denote the average rating of the user aU  and bU .

B. Problem analysis of similarity measures With the development of E-commerce system, the number  of users and the number of items are growing exponentially, which results in the extreme sparsity of the user rating. In the large scale E-commerce systems, compared with the total number of items, the number of items that a user has rated is very scarce, and the items that different users have common rated are much less. In the case that the rating data are extremely sparse, there are some defects in the traditional similarity metrics. We will analyze the existing problems of the     traditional similarity metric in the case of extreme sparse of user rating data in detail later.

In Cosine Similarity method, while building the user-item rating matrix ( )R n m? , if the rating of the item is not given, then assuming that the rating is zero, it can effectively improve the performance of similarity measurement. When the number of users and items is big and user rating data are extremely sparse, it is not credible to set the unknown rating to be zero. In fact, users' preference for unrated items can be neither identical nor completely different. When user aU  and user bU  have no rating on the item, due to their rating may not be zero, it is no doubt that the similarity result between users are raised. When the rating data are extremely sparse, it will have a great impact on the calculation of similarity. When there is only a user given score on the item, setting the unknown score to zero will make the calculation of similarity less than the actual value. When the user rating data are extremely sparse, the influence will be smaller. Thus, in the case that user data is extremely sparse, Cosine Similarity measure is not effective on the calculation of similarity between users. In fact, the cosine similarity calculation value increases the similarity between users, and Adjusted Cosine Similarity measure has the same problem.

In the correlation similarity measurement, let , a bU U  I I  be the rating item set of user ,a bU U . When calculating the similarity between user aU  and user bU , we need to obtain the common rating item set  a bU U I of user aU  and user bU : a b a bU U U UI I I= ? , then  calculate the similarity between user aU  and user bU  on the set of  a bU U I with Pearson Correlation Similarity metric. However,  the credibility of the similarity measured by the method depends on the size of the intersection  a bU U I , the more the  common rated items are, the higher the credibility of the similarity metric is. In the case that user rating are extreme sparse, the set of the common item rated by two users is very small. We can?t grantee that the similarity between users is relatively high even the scores of items are very similar in such small sets. When the rated items of users are the same, that is,  = a bU U  I I , the similarity measured based on the intersection of the items is more credible. When  a b a bU U U U I I I< ? , it is no doubt that  the similarity between two users measured on the intersection of the rated items will be increased, since the deviations of users? rating data in the non-intersection portion are not necessarily identical. Only calculating the similarity on their intersection is similar to setting the deviation of their rating data in non-intersection portion to zero, it will lead to the result that the calculated similarity is higher than the actual value.

Therefore, in the case that user rating data are extremely sparse, there are some defects in the correlation similarity metric.

In conclusion, in the case of user rating data are extremely sparse, the traditional similarity metrics can?t effectively measure the similarity between users, and will increase the value of similarity in the calculation process. There is also the same problem in the calculation of similarity between items, which leads to deviations when predicting users? rating on items. Reference [15,16,17] put forward filling the user-item  matrix for improving, but it still can?t effectively measure the similarity.



III. IMPROVED SIMILARITY MEASURE FOR COLLABORATIVE FILTERING RECOMMENDATION  ALGORITHM  A. Similarity impact factor Similarity metric can be measured on either pairs of users  or pairs of items. In this paper, we take the former for example to illustrate the improved method of similarity, namely, User- based Collaborative Filtering recommendation method. The calculation of similarity between users depends on the number of common rated items for them. Under the condition that user rating data are extremely sparse, traditional metrics have accidental impact. In order to eliminate the impact, reference [18,19] proposed to add a correlation weight factor to calculate the similarity. Further on, reference [20] proposed to set influence weight. In Uncertain nearest Neighbor Collaborative Filtering recommendation algorithm (UNCF) [21], based on the adjusted cosine similarity metric, it fix similarity between users by comparing threshold ?  with number of the common rated items by users. The fixed similarity is expressed as follows:  ( ) ( ) min( , )  ' , ,a bU Ua b a b I I  sim U U sim U U ?  ? ?  = ?  (4)  The threshold ?  is manually set and the optimal threshold parameter is obtained through experiments.

To solve the problems of traditional metrics under the condition that user rating data are extremely sparse , and adaptively correct the similarity between users, we propose a method which uses similarity impact factor ?  to correct the traditional similarity between users, as in  = a b a b a b  U U U U  U U  I I  I I ?  ?  ? (5)  Where aU  I  and bU  I  denote the sets of items rated by user aU and bU , a bU UI is the co-rated items by user aU  and bU . The similarity ( )' ,a bsim U U  which adjusted by the similarity impact factor is expressed as follows:  ( ) ( )' , ,a b a bsim U U sim U U?= ?  (6)  ? When a b a bU U U U  I I I= = , 1? = , it means that user aU  and user bU  have the same rated items, so the similarity between users measured by the traditional metrics can fully reflect the value of the similarity. Therefore the adjusted similarity meets: ( ) ( )' , ,a b a bsim U U sim U U= .

? When a bU U  I = ? , 0? = , it means that user aU  and user bU don?t have any common rated items, so the similarity between users measured by the traditional metrics can?t be used to denote the similarity of users. Therefore  ( )' , 0a bsim U U = .

? When a b a bU U U U  I I I? < < ? , 0 1?< < , it means that the common rated items are one part of all the rated items set. So the similarity impact factor is used to adaptively adjust the similarity measured by the traditional metrics according to the proportion of common rated items in all the rated items. The adjusted similarity is:  ( ) ( ) ( )' , , ,a b a b a bsim U U sim U U sim U U?= ? < .

So we introduce the similarity impact factor ? , which is used to adjust the deviation caused by the traditional metrics under the case that user rating data are extremely sparse, to adaptively improve the measure of similarity. This method improves the quality of the recommendation.

B. Rating prediction algorithm In this paper, the impact factor is used to improve the  similarity metrics. The user?s rating on the items is predicted according to the similarity measured by the method, which shows the user?s interest in the item. As to the target user aU and the item iI  that is ungraded by the user, the collaborative filtering algorithm, which is improved by using the impact factor, combines the similarity between users with the similarity between items and predicts user?s rating on items.

The prediction formula is expressed as follows:    ( ) ( ) ( )  ( ) ( ) ( )  ( )  ,  ,  ,  ' ,  ' ,  ' ,  ' ,  x  x  y  y  a x x i x U U  a i a a x  U U  i y a y y I I  i i y  I I  sim U U R R R R  sim U U  sim I I R R R  sim I I  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ? ?? ? ? ?  = ? + +? ? ? ? ? ?  ? ?? ? ? ?  ? ? +? ? ? ?? ? ? ?  ? ?  ?  ?  (7)  aR  and xR  denote the average rating of the items that rated by user aU  and xU  respectively, iR  and yR  denote the average rating of the item iI  and item yI . In the prediction formula, we  use the parameter ?  to balance the effects of users? similarity and item similarity to predict the rating. When =0? , it is the Item-based Collaborative Filtering. On the contrary, =1? , it is the User-based Collaborative Filtering.



IV. EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS The proposed algorithm?s quality is experimented in this  section, and we would analyze the experimental result and answer the following questions. (1) Whether the similarity metrics improved by the impact factor will perform better in prediction. (2) Whether the improved method is more precise when compared with other collaborative filtering algorithms,  and which one is the best collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm.

A. Datasets The test data in the experiment is the famous movie rating  data provided by the research group GroupLens (http://www.grouplens.org), MovieLens, including 943 users? 100,000 rating records on 1682 movies, every user gives their rates on 20 films at least. The rating value is integer from 1 to 5, and if the rate is 5, the user is very satisfied with the film. On the contrary, rate 1 shows that the user is not interested in the film. The experimental testing dataset is divided into 8 groups, and all the rating matrix is divided into training set and test set.

x  is used to denote the training set?s percentage of the total data set, and we used Density to denote the sparse degree of every sets. The information of datasets is showed in Table 1.

Metrics MAE (Mean Absolute Error) is selected as the metrics of  recommendation system, which belongs to the statistical accuracy metrics. This method is easy to understand and can intuitively measure the recommendation system?s quality, which is the most commonly used method to evaluate the recommendation performance. MAE computes the average deviation between the actual rating and the predicted rating, which are used to evaluate the accuracy of prediction.

Therefore, the smaller the MAE is, the higher the recommendation quality is. Let the rating set of users on items be { }1 2, , , Np p p? , the actual corresponding rating collections be { }1 2, , , Nr r r? , then MAE can be defined as follows:  N  i i i  p r MAE  N =  ? = ?  (8)  C. Comparison of similarity measurements The experimental purpose in this chapter is to compare the  traditional similarity measure method, the method improved by impact factor and the leading research recently. Improved similarity measure method is implemented in the user-based collaborative filtering (UBCF) and the item-based collaborative filtering (IBCF), comparing with the traditional metrics and the adjusted method proposed in the Uncertain Neighbors? Collaborative Filtering (UNCF) [21] in the same datasets.

Firstly, the adjusted method in UNCF is implemented on the dimension of users and items respectively, and MAE is selected as metrics. By gradually increasing the threshold ?  , the best measurement results can be obtained in each dataset.

As show in Table 2 and Table 3, the similarity measured by the method fluctuates little with the change of the threshold, and would be stable when the threshold value reaches a certain value.

Comparison of the similarity measure methods in UBCF     We verified the precision of the improved similarity measurement by comparing with other similarity measurements. Abscissa indicates the data sets that used in the experiment, and the ordinate represents the MAE result. The similarity results are showed respectively based on users and items, as illustrated on Fig 1 and Fig 2. It can be seen that the  MAE of the similarity measures improved by the impact factor is lower than that of other measures, so the proposed method is better than the method of using a threshold in the UNCF. It means that by using the impact factor, the similarity metrics are more precise and the recommended result is better.

Recommendation quality comparison The experimental purpose in this chapter is to validate the  effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by comparing the collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms improving the similarity metrics with that using the traditional similarity measures. We implement collaborative filtering  recommendation algorithms combining the similarity between users with the similarity between items, which using the traditional similarity metrics and the improved similarity metrics with impact factor. The datasets U1-U5 are used in the experiments. The results of the five experiments and the average result of them are showed in Fig 3, in which, abscissa     represents the value of parameter ?  and ordinates represents the MAE results.

As Fig 3 shows, the MAE of the algorithm proposed in this paper is lower than the traditional collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm in all conditions above. So it can be concluded that using impact factor to improve the similarity metrics can significantly improve the accuracy of recommendation. The collaborative filtering recommendation using the adjusted similarity measure that improved by the impact factor have the best performance.



V. CONCLUSION Firstly, in order to deal with the problem that user rating  data are extremely sparse, this paper analyzed the problems of the traditional similarity measurements that their measurement accuracy depends on the number of common ratings of users or items. Then it is proposed to improve Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Algorithm by using similarity impact factor, which can reduce the negative impact due to data sparsity. The experimental results show that the proposed similarity impact factor can improve the accuracy of the similarity measures effectively, and the improved collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms are more precise.
