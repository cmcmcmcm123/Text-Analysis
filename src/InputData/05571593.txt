I.  INTRODUCTION Residents travel survey is an important work of OD  survey in transport planning. It is a kind of basic information which must be collected in transport planning. As a basis of traffic demand forecasting and traffic plan establishment, it is also used to optimize existing urban public transit network and establish a project. In sum, it plays an important role in urban integrative and special transport planning.

Sample rate of residents travel OD survey usually arranges from 3% to 5%, but it is always different in zones due to some factors which can?t be controlled, and the data of this survey are also with particularities. On the basis of data mining technology, using a small quantity of sample data to reckon the characteristics which present general rules can actualize. The information will be formed by analyzing the data of residents travel survey, discovering the relations and then giving them certain signification and association.

The information provides something significant of data, but it is often unrelated to decision-making and can?t be consider as the basis. The more useful information, what is called knowledge, can be obtained only by further analysis.

The ability to make use of such knowledge has become the key factor to successful decision-making. Using data mining technology, people can recognize the potential value of existing data and find some valuable information hidden in the data [1]. Therefore, data mining technology has been widely concerned and become the forefront of research directions in the field of database and information decision- making. Association rules mining can discovery the association or relations among the items in a large quantity of data. It is an important issue in data mining and has been extensively studied in recent years.

This paper used the data of residents travel survey in Fuzhou as a data set. After the pre-processing, the relativity of residents? travel mode choice characteristics and influencing factors were found by using association rules  algorithm. As a result, some meaningful rules were found, which can guide the formulation of transport policy.



II. ASSOCIATION RULES AND APRIORI ALGORITHM  Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman or Times New Roman may be used. If neither is available on your word processor, please use the font closest in appearance to Times. Avoid using bit-mapped fonts if possible. True-Type 1 or Open Type fonts are preferred. Please embed symbol fonts, as well, for math, etc.

Data association is a kind of knowledge in database which can be discovered. The certain regularity between values of two or more variables is called association. It can be divided into simple association, temporal association and causal association. The purpose of association analysis is to identify the association network hidden in the database[2][3].

A.  Basic Concepts  Suppose I={ 1i , 2i ,?, mi } is data item set, D is the set of total exchange T, and DT ? .

Association rules mining is to find dependence relations which fulfill the qualifications from the transaction database D. The terms of every record in D are items, and the object of association rules mining is the rule among items such as  YX ? ?support=s%?confidence=c%.

Some important indexes of association rules are given as  follows: ?  Support: the support of rule ???in transaction  set D is the ratio of the number of transactions including ?  and ?  to the number of total transactions, which is represented by support(?? ? ), i.e. support ( { } DDTTYXTYX /,: ???=? ).

? Confidence: the confidence of rule ? ? ? in transaction set D is the ratio of the number of transactions including ? and ? to the number of transactions including X, which is represented by confidence(??? ), i.e. confidence (??? )= { } { }DTTXTDTTYXT ????? ,:/,:  .

? Expected confidence: it describes the support of data  item set Y without influence of data item set X,   DOI 10.1109/ICIE.2010.267     which is represented by E- confidence (?), i.e.?-  confidence (?)= { } DDTTYT /,: ??  .

? Lift: lift is the ratio of confidence to expected  confidence. It describes the influence of data item set X on data item set Y, which is represented by lift (? ??), i.e. lift (???)=confidence (???)/ E- confidence (?). If the lift is larger, the influence degree of data item set X on data item set Y is larger.

Generally speaking, lift of useful association rules is above 1. If the confidence of association rules is larger than expected confidence, it illuminates that appearance of X promotes the appearance of Y, and it also illuminates the relativity between them. If lift is not above 1, the association rules are out of meanings.

B.  Apriori algorithm Given a transaction set D, association rules mining is to  form a association rule with support and confidence which are larger than min-support and min-confidence. If the rule fulfills thresholds of min-support and min-confidence, it is called strong rule. Min-support expresses the minimum degree that a data item set should meet in the statistical sense.

And the min-confidence is the one that association rules must satisfy, which is defined by user. It represents the minimum reliability of association rules. If the support of data item set is above or up to min-support, the set is called frequent item set or large item set.

Agrawal(1993)designed a basic algorithm Apriori[4], which is based on the idea of two phases frequent item set.

The design of association rules mining algorithm can be divided into two sub-issues:  ? Identify all of large item sets which are existing in database: First calculate Candidate 1 ? item set (k- item set is a set containing k items), and then find the frequent 1 ? item set; according to the frequent 1 - item set, determine the candidate 2 ? item set and then find frequent 2 ? item set, ..., and so on, until there is no candidate item. The last set is the large item set.

? According to the rules and confidence, use large item sets to produce strong rules.



III. CASE ANALYSIS  A. Description of the problem When dealing with residents travel survey data, it is not  only to statistically analyze the travel characteristics of residents, but also to consider the knowledge hidden in resident survey data lists. The knowledge is often based on the synchronous appearance probability of several survey indexes, that is, when the index "travel purpose = work" appears in a range, the probability of the index "travel mode = bus" appears in another range (or the association among multiple indexes). Knowing these relations, the relations of indexes will be found. It provides a basis to analyze issues on the view of relations. The study method of relations among  residents travel characteristics? indexes is to analyze concretely using association rules. Viz. change the quantitative data into Boolean association based on specified min-support and min-confidence defined by user interface.

Carry out data mining by computer in order to get the association rules of various indexes and travel modes.

B. Data Preparation This paper took information records of residents travel  survey in Fuzhou in 2008 as database.

Fuzhou is the capital of Fujian Province, which is famous  as the country's historical and cultural city. It is an important trade center of Chinese southeast coast, a modern port city.

In recent years, the society and economy of Fuzhou developed rapidly. With the increasingly growing of urban population, conflicts of urban traffic were acute. As the basis of transport planning and building, residents travel survey was put forward [5]. Residents travel survey in Fuzhou was conducted in 2008, which collected more than 5,000 survey samples. The resident travel survey data were list in table 1.

The values of indexes express the options, and the definitions of indexes were in table2.

C.  Data Processing Using neural network to preprocess survey data, it was  found that the influence of the seven indexes, travel mode in common use, purpose, work, income, quantity of bicycle holding, family monthly payment of traffic, age, on the choice of travel modes were larger than those three indexes, residence, feeling of urban traffic, and gender.. Importance degree of each index was shown in figure1.

Figure 1.  Importance degree of each index  Therefore, choosing the seven indexes proposed to analyze characteristics of group in each travel mode. Flow chat of association analysis is shown in figure 2.

Because the data of travel modes such as taxi, private car, regular bus, and electric bike were very few, this paper mainly analyzed the characteristics of four kinds of travel modes: walking, bike, bus and motorbike. The results were list in table 3.

The model training used more than 5,000 residents travel survey samples, and in the model training, the min- confidence was 60%, min-support was 3%. So the confidence of rules calculated by the model was larger than 60%, and the support was larger than 3%. The rules were valid.

Figure 2.  Flow chat of association analysis  D. Analysis From table 2 we can conclude that: ? The meaning of Rule 1 is: the residents who chose  travel mode ?5?(i.e. motorbike) were basically workers, the ages of them arranged from 20 to 39 and they had a certain income. The confidence of this rule is 66.50%, with high credibility. That is, the possibility of worker, whose age was between 20 and 39, income between 100 thousand and 300 thousand, to travel by motorbike is 66.5%. At the same time, the ratio of number of records which measured up the rule to the number of survey samples was 7.5%, i.e. among the 5000 samples, there were 375 residents measured up the rule. The confidence of data samples was high.

? Rule 2 illustrated there were 63.8 percents of residents, who usually traveled by motorbike and family monthly payment of traffic was among 50 yuan and 100yuan, chose motorbike as their travel mode. 3.1 percents of samples measured up this rule, i.e. 155 samples supported this rule.

? Rules 3 and 4 showed that the main transport instrument of residents with travel mode 3 (i.e. bus) was bus. The number of samples supported this rule was 710, and the confidence was also larger than 60%. Most of these residents were in the vicinity of downtown, and more convenient to travel by bus.

Because most of companies and factories in Fuzhou moved from urban areas to suburb, such as Mawei, Qingkou and so on, the workers didn?t hold bikes as transport instrument, so bus system become their main travel mode.

? The family monthly payment of traffic for residents who chose travel mode 2 was almost below 50 yuan, and their income was low. Of course, some of them were students or workers who lived nearby. Rule 5 showed if the family has 2 bikes, they might go to work by bike with the possibility of 67.4%. 595 samples supported this rule, which were 11.9% of the total samples. Rule 6 showed employees whose annual income less than 0.1 million inhabitants, and  between the ages of 20-39, would choose bike as their transport instrument with the possibility of 66.7%, 425 samples supported this rule, which were 8.5% of the total samples.

? Rule 7 referred to some residents shopping on holidays, their travel purpose was shopping, and their annual income was below 0.1 million, while the family monthly payment of traffic was less than 50 yuan. Consider the support and confidence, 485residents met this rule, which was 9.7% of the total samples and with high confidence 72.60?. So, the traffic issues aroused due to larger number of people in some lively, bustling area should be concerned.

? Rule 9 referred to some elder people, most of them chose walking as their primary travel mode and it was also a relatively large proportion. Therefore, accessibility design for the elder should be concerned in transport planning.



IV. CONCLUSION As information technology develops continuously, data  mining has also been widely used. Using data mining to analyze residents? travel characteristics, the universal characteristics can be calculated by the small amount of sample data, so as to guide the transport planning and design more effectively. In this paper, neural network was used to filter the indexes of residents? travel characteristics analysis, in order to reduce the larger deviation made by man-made factors, and then used association rules to analyze the characteristics. The characteristics of each travel mode were clearly showed by relative rules, which is of great practical significance in guiding transport planning.
