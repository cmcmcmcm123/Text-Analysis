Constraining and summarizing optimal risk and  preventive patterns in medical data

Abstract-- In this paper, we propose a method to constrain and summarize optimal risk and preventive patterns in medical data using risk and preventive set with weight (RPSW) algorithm. The proposed method was tested by two benchmark medical data sets.

The experiments show that the number of attribute-value items of the constraints was significant reduced and the results are understandable and intuitive.

Keywords--Optimal risk and preventive patterns; Weight; Risk and preventive set; Risk and preventive score matrix.



I.  INTRODUCTION An existing fact is that a large amount of medical data has  been accumulated in health care services, which may potentially make use of it for disease diagnosis and prevention.

A number of algorithms developed have demonstrated to be able to deal with some analysis of diseases and identify new, unexpected, and interesting patterns in hospital infection control and public health surveillance data [1].

C4.5 decision trees [2] can be used to build diagnosis models for medical applications [3, 4]. However,  Some factors limit its application in medical data. Firstly, the accuracy criterion used by C4.5 may not be directly interpretable to medical practitioners.  Although it can build accurate models in general, it misses many alternative paths which are interesting to medical practitioners and researchers.

Association rule mining is another rule discovery method that finds the relationship between attributes, which has been widely used in medical fields [5-7]. It can cause too many rules especially in low support and uninteresting rules. Within the last decade, a large number of association rule algorithms have been developed for mining all, closed [8]and maximal frequent item-sets [9]. But many unrelated and uninteresting rules are emerged as well as. Classic association rule mining methods are Apriori [10] and FP-growth [11]. The comprehensibility and efficiency of these two algorithms are their main problems.

Li et al. [12] firstly made an idea of relative risk and odds ratio into patterns mining. Based on it, mining risk patterns in medical data was developed [13], but this approach still produces many patterns. A method with optimal risk patterns was presented [14] to exclude superfluous patterns that are of no interest to medical practitioners.

We incorporate the weight into our method to judge the importance of attribute-value item. To our best knowledge, the concept of weight was firstly introduced in [15] to mine association rules of weighted items. This paper aims to propose an optimal method using weights to extract rules more efficiently than the method of optimal risk and preventive patterns in medical data presented by Li et al. [14].



II. DEFINITIONS AND RPSW ALGORITHM  A. Definitions 1) Risk and preventive patterns  Medical data may be divided into two classes by malignant and benign. Patterns are defined as a set of attribute-value item.

A risk pattern in this paper refers to the antecedent of a rule with the consequence of malignant and a preventive pattern with the consequence of benign. How to judge a pattern is risk or preventive? One of the most often used ratios in epidemiological studies is relative risk or odds ratio, a concept for the comparison of two groups or populations with respect to a certain undesiarbale event. Here we only use relative risk.

We will define the following risk and preventive patterns formally using the value of relative risk.

Definition1. Risk patterns are frequent patterns, whose relative risk is greater than a given threshold. Conversely, preventive patterns are frequent patterns, whose relative risk is less than a given threshold.

2) Optimal risk and preventive patterns Mining risk and preventive patterns can bring redundant  patterns and are not convenient to observe results for users. As a result, MORE (Mining Optimal Risk pattErnsets) algorithm was designed by Li et al [14] for optimal risk and preventive patterns. The reason why optimal risk and preventive patterns can be mined is that optimal risk and preventive patterns set satisfy anti-monotone property. They are proved in [14].

Definition2. Optimal risk (or preventive) pattern set includes patterns that have  higher (or lower in case the relative risk is less than 1) than relative rsik of their simple form patterns.

Optimal risk and preventative patterns are extracted from risk and preventive patterns. When the relative risk of risk patterns are less than or equal to that of their sub-patterns and  This project supported by Yunnan Fundamental Research Foundation of Application (No: 2009ZC 049M) and Science Research Foundation of Kunming University of (No: 2009-022).

the relative risk of preventive patterns are more than or equal to that of their sub-patterns, these risk and preventive patterns are ignored.

3) Risk and preventive set Based on optimal risk and preventive patterns, we can  calculate the frequency of each attribute-value item and sort all attribute-value items in the frequency decreasing order with statistics. The attribute-value items existed in optimal risk patterns can develop a risk set while those in optimal preventive patterns can generate a preventive set. We define risk set and preventive set as follows.

Definition3. If an attribute-value item is a frequent element of optimal risk/preventive patterns and its frequency is greater than or equal to the given expected frequency threshold, then it belongs to risk/preventive set.

Mining risk and preventive set is more efficient than mining optimal  risk and preventive patterns. The first reason is that we only care about attribute-value items instead of the combination of each other. The second reason is that we can know the weight of each attribute-value item by calculating the frequency of each attribute-value item, and then we can easily know what contribution each attribute-value item is for mining the pattern set.

B.  RPSW Algorithm  If we suppose that 1n  is the number of optimal risk patterns,  2n  is the number of optimal preventive patterns; supp is the  local support [13] threshold, then suppn1 ? and suppn2 ? are expected frequency threshold of initial risk and preventive set respectively.

We also define 1k and 2k  are the number of attribute-value item existed in IRS (Initial Risk Set) and IPS (Initial Preventive  Set,  'k1 and 'k2  are the number of attribute-value item existed  in RS (Risk Set) and PS (Preventive Set) respectively. So we can suppose that Tk321 ]IRi,...,IRi,IRi,[IRiIRS 1= ,  T k321 ]IPi,...,IPi,IPi,[IPiIPS 2= , their corresponding IRFS  (Initial Risk Frequency Set) and IPFS (Initial Preventive Frequency Set) are Tk321 ]IRf,...,IRf,IRf,[IRf 1  and  T k321 ]IPf,...,IPf,IPf,[IPf 2 . IRFS and IPFS should have  follow property as (2) and (3) depicting.

IPSIRS , we should remove their common attribute-value items because of contradiction between IRS and IPS. Then we can get RS, RFS, PFS and PS,  IRSRS ? , IRFSRFS ? , IPSPS ?  and IPFSPFS ? . If we  can suppose that T'k321 ]Ri,...,Ri,Ri,[RiRS  =  and  T 'k321 ],...PiPi,Pi,[PiPS  = , their corresponding RFS (Risk  Frequency Set) and PFS (Preventive Frequency Set) are T  'k321 ]Rf,...,Rf,Rf,[Rf  and T'k321  ]Pf,...,Pf,Pf,[Pf  . RFS  and PFS are also characterized by the following (4) and (5).

Pf  Pf100 ,  Pf  Pf100 ,  Pf  Pf100 [PSM '  2k  1j  '  2k  1j  ' 2k  1j  ' 2k  1j ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ? =  ====  (6)  From (6) and (7), we can know that a patient is risk when the weight is equal to or greater than  ) Rf  Rf100  Rf  Rf100 ( '  1k  1j  ' 1k  1j j   j   ?  ? +  ?  ?  ==  and a patient is preventive when the  weight is equal to or greater than ) Pf  Pf100  Pf  Pf100 ( '  2k  1j  ' 2k  1j j   j   ?  ? +  ?  ?  ==  .

RPSW algorithm has two functions, one function can generate IRS and IPS and another function can develop RS and PS with weight.



III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  A.  Experimental Results We used two benchmark medical data sets from UCI  repositories [16] to compare the efficiency with optimal risk/preventive patterns, representative risk/preventive patterns, which are described in TABLE 1.

1) Comparison with optimal risk/preventive patterns and representative risk/preventive patterns    We use different distributions as 20 and 3 for data sets Hypothyroid and Breast cancer respectively. The purpose of different distributions is to test popularity of method.

We set the minimum local support as supp=5%, the length of the attribute-value item as L=4 and L=5, minimum relative risk as 1.5 is a default value for MORE algorithm.

We firstly generate optimal risk/preventive patterns and representative risk/preventive patterns with MORE algorithm, and then accumulate attribute-value items in optimal risk/preventive patterns. Attribute-value items in optimal risk patterns are used to generate risk set while attribute-value items in optimal preventive patterns are used to generate preventive set. Furthermore, we calculate the number of attribute-value items in optimal risk/preventive patterns, representative risk/preventive patterns, and risk/preventive set.

TABLE 2 reports that the number of attribute-value item in risk/preventive set is smaller than that in optimal risk /preventive patterns and in representative risk/preventive patterns.

2) The weight of each attribute-value item in risk and preventive set  The weight of each attribute-value item is from the percentage of each attribute-value item in risk and preventive set. But we suppose the total weight is 100, and the percentage of each attribute-value item multiplying 100 is the weight of each attribute-value item. The weight of each attribute-value item is used to know how important each attribute-value item is, at the same time, we can know a patient?s risk weight and preventive weight using it.

Fig. 1 lists the weight of each attribute-value item in risk set of hypothyroid and breast cancer. We can see the first two largest weights of attribute-value item are ?thyroid_surgery = t? (18.3150) and ?query_hypothyroid = t? (12.0879) in hypothyroid, while the first two largest weights of attribute- value item are ?bare_nuclei = l? (14.3498) and ?clump_thickness = l? (11.6592) in breast cancer. In hypothyroid, the sum of the first two largest weights of attribute-value item is 30.4029. It means that if a patient?s weight of attribute-value item is equal to or more than 30.4029, the patient is at risk of hypothyroid. Similarly, if a patient?s weight of attribute-value item is equal to or more than 26.009, the patient is at risk of breast cancer. Fig. 2 shows the weight of each attribute-value item in preventive set of hypothyroid and breast cancer. We also can know that the first two largest weights of attribute-value item are ?thyroid_surgery = f? (23.7624) and ?goitre = f? (20.7921) in hypothyroid, while the first two largest weights of attribute-value item are ?bland_chromatin = s? (20.4762) and ?bare_nuclei = s? (17.1429) in breast cancer. Therefore, a patient has little probability of hypothyroid if the weight of attribute-value item is equal to or more than 44.5545. Similarly, a patient has little  probability of breast cancer if the weight of attribute-value item is equal to or more than 37.6191.

The sum of the first two largest weights of attribute-value item is used to be a threshold which can decide a patient?s condition. Therefore, the attribute-value item with high weight can construct a risk/preventive pattern using few combinations while the attribute-value item with low weight can construct a risk/preventive pattern using more combination. The length of a pattern is at least 2. The minimum length of a pattern is also decided by different conditions.

IV. CONCLUSION In this paper, we constrain and summarize optimal risk  and preventive patterns in medical data using risk and preventive set. Experimental results can conclude that optimal risk and preventive patterns are suitable for initial data analysis; the proposed algorithm is useful for decision of medical practitioners and researchers. The results are understandable and may reveal some intuitive indicators to medical practitioners and researchers. It can generate smaller size of set and provide with corresponding weight with each attribute-value item, it is a post-processing based on optimal risk and preventive patterns.
