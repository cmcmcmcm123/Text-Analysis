I. INTRODUCTION  The association rule is an important topic in the data mining and knowledge discovery research field. A number of algorithms have been proposed to generate frequent itemsets since the problem was pointed out by R.Agrawal in 1993 [I].

With the further research on the mining of frequent patterns, it has been recognized that some infrequent patterns can provide very useful insight view into the data set. Positive association rules exist only in frequent itemsets, while negative association rules exist not only in frequent itemsets, but more exist in infrequent itemsets. Previous researches have mostly focused on positive association rules. Negative association rules also play an important role in many areas, especially in competitive analysis and investment analysis.

But little study is about negative association rules.

Traditional algorithm apriori treats each item as uniformity, but ignores the difference of all items. In fact, the importance of each item is often different. For example, if some goods have great profits or some goods are on sale? promotion, decision-makers tend to be more concerned about the sales of goods. In order to solve the above problems, the concept of weight is added to association rules. When every item is associated with weight, Apriori closure property is no longer in point, so a new prune method is required.

In practice, many databases are not static but changeable.

When some records are added or deleted in a database, it could potentially invalidate some exsting rules. To solve the above three questions, an algorithm MIIWIU is put forward to mine frequent itemsets and infrequent itemsets from changeable database on weighted condition and the minimum support is not changed.

The paper is organized as follows. The definition and related concepts about incremental updating for frequent and infrequent itemsets on weighted condition are given in Section II. Incremental updating for frequent and infrequent itemsets are described in Section III. The experimental results and analysis are showed in the fourth part, and conclusion is made in Section V.



II. RELATED CONCEPTS  A. Frequent and .ll!frequent .ltemsets Generation and Association Rule .Mining  Association rule mining is a process that finds all association rules satisfying the minimum support and minimum confidence in a given transaction database. A common strategy adopted by many association rule mining algorithms is to decompose the problem into two major subtasks:  1) Frequent and .ll!frequent .ltemsets Generation. The itemsets whose objective is to find all the itemsets that satisfy the minimum support threshold are called frequent itemsets. On the contrary they are called infrequent itemsets.

2) Rule Generation. Whose objective is to extract all the high-condidence rules from the frequent itemsets found in the previons step. These rules are called strong rules.

The computational requirements for frequent and infrequent itemset generation are generally more expensive than those of rule generation. So we'll mainly discuss the first question in this paper.

B. .Mining .lnftequent .ltemset  In the support-confidence framework, if supp(A) ? wminsupp, then A is a frequent itemset; and if supp(A) < wminsupp, then A is an infrequent itemset. Because the weight is associated with item, the downward closed property is no longer in point. Therefore, the method of pruning need considering again.

According to the formula of negative association rules, the infrequent itemsets are divided into the following parts [2]:  1) The itemsets whose support is less than the minimum weighted support in discovering the ftequent itemsets.

2) The LHS if them is ftom the subset if a traction record, the RHS of them is ftom the subset of non-existing in      a traction record  J) Subset if non-existing items if every traction record  C. .Incremental Updating for Frequent and .lJ?frequent .ltemsets  In the real world, many databases are not static but changeable. They are dynamic databases. When some records are added or deleted in a database, even needed to adjust the minimum support threshold which gradually gathered in the frequent and infrequent itemsets we are interested in. Therefore, How to effectively update the frequent and infrequent itemsets from the dynamic database has very important application value. This is called incremental updating for frequent and infrequent itemsets.

Generalized updating association rules mean mining new association rules from the new database DB+, which is formed of a new dataset db and an original database DB.

The problem of incremental updating for frequent and infrequent itemsets is mining new itemsets from the new database DB+.

There are three mainly problems about incremental updating for frequent and infrequent itemsets :  J) For a given minimum support and minimum confidence, how to mine .frequent and in.frequent itemsets .from the new database db u DB when a new dataset db is inserted into the original database DB  J) For a given minimum support and minimum confidence, how to generate .frequent and in.frequent itemsets .from the new database DB - db when a new dataset db is deleted .from the old database DB  J) For a given database DB, how to mine .frequent and iJ?frequent itemsets when its minimum support and minimum co'!ftdence changing.

In [3], Agrawal R, and Srikant R proposed FUP algorithm which is consistent with Apriori algorithm for the first update algorithm. Brin S, Motwani R, and Silverstein C proposed FUP2 algorithm [4] which is taking into account the first and second problems simultaneously.

For the third problem, IUA and PIUA algorithms [5] have been proposed by Feng yucai and fengjinlin.

Compared with incremental updating positive association rule, current researches about negative association rules for incremental update are fewer.

In fact, the negative association rules for incremental updates is similar to incremental update of positive association rules, that is mining negative association rules in new database. But there still exist some differences.

Positive associational rules only remain in frequent itemset, while negative association rules not only remain in frequent itemset, more exist in infrequent itemset. When resolving the problem of incremental updating for positive association rule, we just need to fmd all frequent itemsets from the updated database, and then use formula to mine positive association rules. While to negative association rule, we need to find all frequent and infrequent itemsets from the  updated database, and then use related algorithm to mine negative rules.

D. Weight  Weighted Association Rules are as follows: there are n  records and m items. Let.l = (if, i2, ? ? .  , im/ be a set of items  and W= (Wf, W.z, ...  , wm) (WiE [0, J j) be the set of non? negative real numbers. A pair ( X, w(.V ) is called a weighted item where XE.I is an item and W(.VE W is the weight associated with X A transaction is a set of weighted items, each of which may appear in transactions with different weights. A dataset may therefore be defined as a set D of transactions.

Given a weighted itemset X and a set of transactions, referred to as D, we say X has support in D if s% of transactions in D support X The weighted support of an itemset Xin a dataset D, denoted as wsup(.V = count?X) / /D/* w(.V, where countD(.V is the number of transactions in D containing X Note that the support of a weighted itemset X is always less than or equal to the support of any of its generalization.

In this paper the following form is used: sup(X?Y)= countD(x?Y)I/D/ wsup(X?Y) =avg(wf, W.z, ... , wp)* sup(X?Y) where p is the number of items in itemset X, avg( Wj,  W.z, ... , wp) is the average value of the weight of itemset Xu Y and sup(X?Y) is support of itemset XuYbefore the item is associated with weight.

An itemset is said to be weighted-frequent (large) if its support is larger than a user-specified value (also called minimum weighted support (wminsup?.

E Calculate Weighted Support  Support of negative association rules associated with weight are transformed to the following forms to be calculated [6]:  J) wsup(-,A) = J- wsup(A);  J) wsup(Au--JJ) = wsup(A) - wsup(AuB); J) wsup(-,AuB) = wsup(B) - wsup(AuB);  4) wsup(-,Au--JJ)=J-wsup(A)-wsup(B)+ wsup(AuB).



III. PRESENTATION OF ALGORITHM  A. Concepts  Mining association rules of transaction database can be seen as a collection of itemsets. The collection is divided into two mutually exclusive parts: frequent itemsets and infrequent itemsets. We use DB and db to respectively represent original database and new added database. T represents the total number of the transaction database DB, and tdenoted db. While DBF, db/and DB+.F respectively represents the frequent itemsets of DB, db and DB+. The infrequent itemsets of DB, db and DB+ denoted by DBNF, db. if, DB+.NF.

When DB n db = 0, clearly, any subset of DBNF and db.nf is all infrequent itemset.

VI-37 Volume 1     The proof is as follow : 'if A EDBNF, there must exist A. count < S * T. Because of S * T < S * ( T + t). So  A.count < S * ( T + t ). That' s also means A is an infrequent itemset. With the same method, we can prove 'if A E db. if. A is an infrequent itemset ( A.count indicates the support count of itemset A in the database ). While for DBF and db../, the subsets may still be frequent itemsets.

DB+.NF consists of two parts. One part is any subset of DB.NF and db.if, the other is the remaining subsets of DB+.Fand db/.

When DB n db *0, divided into disjoin part and intersection part [7]. Disjoint part may arise a collection of frequent and infrequent itemsets: L = DBF - db/, L' = dbJ - DBF, NL= DBNF - db.if, NL' = db. if - DBNF Intersection part can be divided into four subsets Lj, L2, L3, L4?  Lj = DBFn db../, each itemset of Lj is frequent itemset in both DB and db.

L2 = DBNFn db. n../, each itemset of L2 is infrequent itemset in both DB and db.

L3 = DBFn db. if, each itemset of L3 is frequent itemset in DB and infrequent itemset in db.

L4 = DBNFn db../, each itemset of L4 is infrequent itemset in DB and frequent itemset in db.

B algorithm Design  The main idea of MIIWIU algorithm Input: the original transaction database DB,  additional transaction database db.

Output: frequent and infrequent itemsets of DB,  frequent and infrequent itemsets of db, frequent and infrequent itemsets of DB+.

IV. ANALYSE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  We conducted our experiment on man-made datasets to study the algorithm MIIWIU.

Set weight of each item based on the user's interest in Table I.

TABLE I. WEIGHT OF ITEM  Item Weight  A 0.1  B 0.2  C 0.9  D 0.4  E 0.6  F 0.3  G 0.5  H 0.8  A. Experiment J  When DB n db = 0, there are 203 transactions in the original database, 53 transactions in the added database, and eight largest categories were kept. Assume that the minimum weighted support is 8% (wminsup = 8%). The result is in Table II.

TABLE II. DBnDB=0  Number DB db DB+  Frequent 230 204 432  itemsets Infrequent  0 8 10 itemsets  From the result we can see that the number of frequent and infrequent itemsets from DB+ is different of the former two databases. Some frequent itemsets in DB become infrequent itemsets in DB+.

B Experiment 2  When DB n db * 0, there are 166 transactions in the original database, 63 transactions in the added database, and eight largest categories were kept. Assume that the minimum weighted support is 8% (wminsup = 8%).The result is in Table III.

DBnDB*0  DB+ Number DB db  inle1'SeCl tlisjoinl  Frequent 187 170 7 252  iternsets Infrequent  4 18 21 7 itemsets  The results show that the number of frequent itemsets from the combined database is less than the former two databases, but the number of infrequent itemsets is larger than them.



V. CONCLUSIONS  Negative association rules play an important role in many areas. Many databases are not static but changeable.

Negative association rules exist not only in frequent itemset, more exist in infrequent itemset. Incremental updating  algorithm is important for mining infrequent itemset in dynamic databases. In this paper, we proposed a new algorithm MIIWIU, the algorithm uses the improved Apriori algorithm and the set nature to mine the frequent and infrequent itemsets. Traditional Algorithm Apriori treats each item as uniformity, ignores the difference of all items. The concept of weight is added to the algorithm. The incremental updating algorithm for infrequent itemsets has been implemented with Visual C# 2005. The experiment results prove that the algorithm is efficient.
