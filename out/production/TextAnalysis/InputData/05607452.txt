A WSRF-enabled Distributed Data Mining Approach To Association Rules  WEKA4WS -Based

Abstract   As a latest member in distributed computing technology family, the grid computing can play an increasingly important role with the progress of the DDM(Distributed Data Mining) technology in recent years. However, conventional data mining is not satisfied with the requirement due to the heterogeneous and distributed of the datasets. Grid computing emerged as an important new field of distributed computing, which could support for distributed knowledge discovery applications. This paper has a try at combing the grid with web service in order to solve the problem of distributed association rules mining based on the research for the matrix theory, and achieves the distributed association rules algorithm by dint of Weka Library, presents a fast distributed association rules algorithm matrix-based ,and also proves the correctness of the algorithm in theory.

Finally it verifies the validity of the algorithm and the feasibility of the architecture with the distributed association rules based on WEKA4WS. This effective and fast algorithm shows sound extension, short time complexity, space complexity and small communication cost. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms, a performance analysis of Weka4WS for executing distributed data mining tasks in different network scenarios are presented.

1. Introduction  With the rapid development of information technology, massive data collections in terabyte and petabyte scale located on geographically distributed sites need to be maintained and analyzed in many areas such as scientific, commercial, financial, and so on.

The conventional technology used for data mining is incapable of dealing with this problem. So a new distributed computing  model should be found, the grid technology can satisfy  the requirement[1]. The appearance of grid and web service bring a new chance for distributed data mining. Owing to the grid technology can link the different structural resources which are distributed in different places together, and a new platform which has super computing power is formed. Therefore, the computing resources, memory  resources, algorithms resources, information resources and so on can be shared. As a new web applying mode and distributed computing model, web service can be used to solve all kinds of cooperating problem between different structural resources. So it is a new try to make use of the net technology for distributed data mining [2]- [4]. This paper puts forward a completely new distributed mining algorithm for matrix association rules WEKA4WS-Based  in grid, its advantage is save time, it only need scan the database which distributed in each node once and need not generate candidates and frequent item sets. This algorithmic could find the maximum frequent item sets which meet the minimum support in short time through the operation of vector and matrix.

2. Concepts of weka4ws and WSRF  Weka4WS is a an open-source framework developed by the University of Calabria to extend the widely used Weka toolkit for supporting distributed data mining on Grid environments .Weka provides a large collection of machine learning algorithms written in Java for data pre-processing, classification, clustering, association rules, and visualization, which can be invoked through a common graphical user interface[5]. In Weka, the overall data mining process takes place on a single machine, since the algorithms can be executed only locally.

The goal of Weka4WS is to extend Weka to support remote execution of data mining algorithms through WSRF Web Services. In this way, distributed data mining tasks can be concurrently executed on decentralized Grid nodes by exploiting data distribution and improving application performance. In Weka4WS, the data mining algorithms for classification, clustering and association rules can be also executed on remote Grid resources. To enable remote invocation, all the data mining algorithms provided by the Weka library are exposed as a Web Service, which can be easily deployed on the available Grid nodes. Thus, Weka4WS also extends the Weka GUI to enable the invocation of the data mining algorithms that are exposed as Web Services on remote Grid nodes.

___________________________________     To achieve integration and interoperability with standard Grid environments, Weka4WS has been designed by using the Web Services Resource Framework (WSRF) as enabling technology. In particular, Weka4WS has been developed by using the WSRF Java library provided by Globus Toolkit 4.0.x (GT4).In the Weka4WS framework all nodes use the GT4 services for standard Grid functionalities, such as security and data management.

WSRF[6](Web Service Resource Framework) has born as the production of Grid computing and web services combination, which is a family of technical specification concerned with the resource properties, addressing, service group, and lifetime management of state resources. WSRF codifies the relationship between stateless web services and state resources in terms of the implied resource pattern, which gives the definition of the WS-Resource. WSRF describes the WS-Resource definition and association with the description of a Web Service interface, and describes how to make the properties of a WS-Resource accessible through a Web Service interface.

A Fast Distributed Matrix Association Rules Mining Algorithm weka4ws-based (FDMAR)  Association rule mining is compartmentalized into two sub-questions:  1) Find all frequent sets in the data sets D : the frequent of each item must at least as big as scheduled minimum support .

2) Generate association rule according to the frequent itemsets: the rules must at least as big as the minimum support and minimum confidence.

In this algorithm we can get a matrix made up of 0 and 1 by scanning the database only once , and then compute the inner product of vectors .

5.1 Reasoning and Proving for Fast Distributed Matrix Association Rules  Traditional distributed algorithms need to generate and the judge frequent ittemsets in every local node , but in grid environment the distributed matrix association rules algorithm based on weka4ws need to scan the database only once and provide every local matrix parameter , need not carry out local judgement[9]. Because of the number of transactions included in the database on every local node may be different, the size of Boolean matrix that causes to generate is not uniform ( the number of row in matrix mainly), if every local node transmits the parameter of the matrix that is not uniform to global node, it can bring great trouble to the later handling. We have solved this problem with a kind of ingenious handling in algorithm, carried out illation for theory of model     and strict mathematics proof, and inspected the validity and correctness of algorithm with specific example.

Definition 6 : for any given transaction database D, suppose:  :f D A?   ( ) ( )ij m nA f D r ?= = 1,  ( 1,2,..., ; 1,2..., ) 0,  i j ij  i j  I T r i m j n  I T ???= = =? ???  :F A T?

Database D can be mapped on the Boolean matrix A with the effect of  function f  by scanning the database only once, and A can be mapped on the matrix T with the effect of  function F.

Definition 7: Let ( )ijA a=  be m-by-s matrix, where  ija denote the element in the thj column of thi row in  A . Let ( )ijB b=  be s-by-n matrix, where ijb denote the element of  in the thj column of thi row in B .C is the product of matrix A and B,  =C AB .where ( )i j m nc ?=C  1 1 2 2  s  i j i j i j i s s j ik k j k  c a b a b a b a b =  = + + + =??   1, 2, , ; 1, 2, ,i m j n= =? ? .

Definition 8: Let ( )ij m nA a ?=  be m-by-n matrix,  divide A into M different matrixes 1 2, ,..., MA A A , where  11 1   n  m mn m n  a a A  a a ?  ? ? ?= ? ? ? ? ? ?  ? ? ? ?  ?  11 1    n  s sn s n  a a A  a a ?  ? ? ?= ? ? ? ? ? ?  ? ? ? ?  ?  (s+1)1 (s+1)   (s+t)1 (s+t  ...

Definition 9: Databases distributed in M different  grid local nodes, we can obtain Boolean matrix iA and  local association transaction matrix  ( ) ( )Ti i i i n nT F A A A ?= = by scanning the  database iD only once in node i  .

During the process of distributed association rules mining , the itemsets included in each local database is invariable and made up of  one or some one in itemsets  1 2 nI={i , i ,...,i }(1 j n)? ? ,but the number of transactions in local database 1 2 m T={ t , t ,...,t },  pt (1 p m)? ? is variational, in order to insure the addition-enable and coherence, calculate  ( )Ti i i n nT A A ?= , in this way we can ensure that transaction matrix iT  is a n-by-n matrix, iT can be denoted as follows:  11 12 1  22 2( ) ( )  n  nT i i i n n ij n n  nn  t t t t t  T A A t  t  ? ?  ? ? ? ? 	= = = ? ?  ?  ? ? ? ?  Actually ( )1 2, ,..., nA ? ? ?= , i?  is a m dimensional vector, according to the definition of inner product we know , , ( )i j i i k i j? ? ? ?? = ? , namely the maximal value in iT  and denote it as k, k must be on the leading diagonal[10].

It has decreased greatly the time consumption that interactive communication brings.

2) In order to simplify the process of calculating , carry out matrix operation ( ) ( )Ti i i i n nT F A A A ?= = once in local node, then execute additive operation of matrix in global node, achieve the transformation from concentration to distribution.

3) The problem of seeking frequent itemsets has became the problem of operating matrix , avoid to generate huge candidate itemsets and the problem for the join step and prune step, and decrease the time complexity and space complexity [11].

4) Start with the leading diagonal elements of matrix directly, find out the rows that satisfy the minimum support threshold, reduce the time for scanning matrix.

5) In the process of seeking frequent itemsets, make use of a kind of scanning method dexterously to avoid carry out the logic operation "and" between vectors .

Conclusion Association rule mining is a very important problem  in the field of data mining. This paper puts forward a new distributed mining algorithm for matrix association rules WEKA4WS-Based in grid environment , and embed it in WeKa4WS frame. It is excellent that it can reduce the times of accessing database and need not to generate candidate item sets based on Boolean matrix for Apriori algorithm need to generate plenty of candidate itemsets[12]. The new algorithm need to scan the database only once and as the structure of the Boolean matrix is simple, it can be  understood easily, and it is easy to compute without generating plenty of candidate item sets. It is specially important that this paper combines the grid with web service technology, builds the distributed data mining system under the grid environment, and also proves the validity of algorithms and feasibility of system. It has upper veracity and better effect for distributed association rules mining.
