Abstract Mixed signal ATE (Automated Test Equipment) often integrates a waveform sampler for testing UHF signals.

While performing under-sampling, slow jitter greatly influences the captured signal which is reconstructed into a meaningful waveform by manner of coherent waveform reconstruction. The purpose of this work is to remove slow jitter effects from a high-speed digital signal measured by a waveform sampler and to reconstruct a clear waveform and eye pattern. The test signal is a PRBS (Pseudo Random Binary Sequence) bit stream with slow jitter. The PRBS signal becomes an extreme wideband multi-tone from a spectrum point of view, so capturing such a signal with a waveform sampler needs a carefully organized test plan based on the coherent condition. Measured data is reconstructed into a meaningful waveform by reshuffling the sequence of the sampled points. Jitter in the signal is a kind of PM (Phase Modulation) which smears the spectrum. So the point of processing is to demodulate the PM signal and then restore the original multi-tone components. An elegant mathematical equation is introduced to perform the carrier tone recovery. Because of the multi-tone structure, processing needs to be applied to each one of the tone components. First, the PM effect is removed from each tone, and then each tone needs to be compensated amplitude loss by referencing the original tone power. Finally processing successfully reconstructs a clear PRBS waveform and a big eye opening. This paper reports the signal processing in detail with showing 7 Gbps 127-bit PRBS waveform.

1. Introduction 1.1 Background High-speed digital interface devices are evaluated for their transmitted waveform integrity using PRBS or device specific test patterns. The frequency spectrum of those signals is dispersed to more than 10 GHz. Such a high frequency signal is attenuated by the frequency characteristics of the signal path, so the measured waveform is often compensated by de-embedding the s- parameters of signal transmission lines. Since those interfaces are usually exposed to a harsh noisy environment, the transmission signal is contaminated by jitter. Moreover such devices may employ SSC (Spread Spectrum Clocking) for reducing EMI (Electro-Magnetic  Interference) outside the device. So, the signal speed looks stable in a short period of time; however, the UI (Unit Interval) is continuously and subtly changing around the nominal period. In this situation, capturing a whole waveform set is not an easy task for digital ATE which is designed to capture signals with as stable a frequency as possible. My colleagues and I reported a method to reconstruct a clear waveform and an eye pattern (or diagram) at ITC 2012. It is named DNA (Data aNAlysis) and RNA (Recovering aNAlysis). This method can dramatically recover a clear waveform; however it requires a reference signal in addition to the target signal and the test conditions are not clearly organized yet. [1]  Mixed signal ATE such as the Advantest V93000 can be equipped with a waveform sampler [2] to test UHF signals, which has a very wide band sample-and-hold circuit and a high-speed A/D converter in the analog front-end. This resource can capture high-speed digital waveforms as well as UHF analog signals. There is an issue for the sampler to capture high-speed digital signals containing slow jitter.

This paper specifically reports how it removes slow jitter from the measured signal and reconstructs a clear waveform and a big eye opening.

Figure 1 Coherent Waveform Reconstruction   1.2 Coherent Waveform Reconstruction When denoting the test signal and the sampling frequencies as Ft and Fs respectively, and the number of signal cycles and the number of sampling points M and N respectively, there is a coherent equation defined as follows:  N M  Fs Ft =      (1)      Lecture 4.3                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                        2   Where M and N should be integers and relatively prime.

This is the coherent condition which is important to comply with in mixed signal tests. [3] Figure 1 (a) illustrates a 3-cycle (=M) sinusoidal waveform which is sampled with 10 (=N) sampling strobes. The sampled points are marked with numbered dots. Since three and ten are relatively prime, each sampled point resides at a different primary phase of the sinusoid.  The M-cycle sinusoid can be reshuffled based on the primary phase sequence to make up a single-cycle sinusoid. Figure 1 (b) illustrates how it is reshuffled. This reshuffling processing is called coherent waveform reconstruction (CWR). This is very useful in mixed signal tests; for example, it is effective as a quick signal integrity check in online debug.

Moreover, CWR is a very important method for reconstructing a waveform which has been under-sampled by a waveform sampler. Mixed signal ATE provides an application specific processing instruction to perform the CWR. [4]  1.3 Under-sampling by Waveform Sampler Figure 2 illustrates a ribbon of the panoramic frequency domain. The red line marked Fs indicates the location of the actual sampling rate. N (=32 in the figure) denotes the number of sampling points. Then, a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) generates N/2 bins of spectrum. The baseband bin numbers are 0, 1, 2, ?, 15, and higher frequency components  are extended in bin numbers as 16, 17, 18, ? The broad range of the frequency domain can be considered as a series of N/2-size pages concatenated together. When performing under-sampling, you should consider the concatenated pages are folded page-wise as (b), and degenerated into a single baseband page as (c).

Consequently the FFT provides the baseband spectrum illustrated as (d) at the end.

Figure 2 Page Concept of Under-sampling  For instance, if you have test signal spectra at extended bin numbers of 35, 70 and 105 as (a) illustrates, when performing under-sampling, they are aliased and found at the bins 3, 6 and 9 in the baseband as (d) illustrates. This is the methodology the waveform sampler uses to capture and analyze very high frequency signals regardless of violating the Nyquist theorem. Under-sampling loses the frequency information of test signal. However, in device  testing situation the test signal is well known in advance so this does not become an issue.

The Nyquist theorem prescribes Ft<(Fs/2) so that M<(N/2).

In under-sampling situation Equation (1) can be extended as follows;  N MxK  N M  Fs Ft +==     (2)  Where K and Mx are integers. Mx should be selected as (- N/2)<Mx<(N/2). Then |Mx| becomes the aliased bin number in the baseband in Figure 2 (d). [5]  1.4 Under-sampling of Wideband Signal The target signal is a PRBS bit stream which actually becomes a wideband multi-tone signal. Figure 3 illustrates the frequency domain of a multi-tone test signal as well as the sampler extended frequency domain.

Figure 3 Under-sampling of Wideband Signal  Let?s suppose that the test signal multi-tone consists of total L lines of spectra, whose frequency spacing is ?F. If you capture this wideband signal with N sampling points by under-sampling, all spectral lines must be accommodated in the baseband which consists of N/2 bins.

So N>2L. The original signal spectra must fall exactly in the sampler?s extended bin locations one by one, so ?F=Nx?Fres, where Nx is an integer and Fres=Fs/N which is the sampler?s frequency resolution. N should be selected as 2n for the FFT. When folding the pages by under- sampling, each one of the aliased bins must not duplicate each other in the baseband. So Nx must be selected as an odd integer. Consequently the waveform sampler should be programmed based on the following guidelines: [6]  N>2L   (N=2n for FFT)  (3)  Fs=N??F/Nx  (Nx=Odd Integer)  (4)  1.5 Test Condition A digital pin driver of the V93000 generates a 127-bit PRBS bit stream running at the speed of 7 Gbps. The resource to capture this signal is the waveform sampler ?MCC? (Multi-Channel analog resource C), which is capable of capturing analog signals up to approximately 10 GHz. Its actual sampling rate is a maximum of 110 Msps.

Lecture 4.3                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                        3   Therefore, even an extremely wideband signal must be captured within the baseband maximum of 55 MHz.

In order to generate a 2-UI eye pattern (that is convenient to see), let?s program the waveform sampler to observe two loops of the 127-bit PRBS, so a total 254 UIs of PRBS data is actually captured as illustrated in Figure 4. When you reshuffle the captured waveform by the factor of 127, a 2-UI window eye is efficiently reconstructed.

Figure 4 Target Signal Structure (2 Loops of 127-bit PRBS)  The frequency of slow jitter or SSC here is assumed to be around several kHz to several 10?s of kHz so that the sampler?s frequency resolution should be on the order of kHz. Then the sampling condition based on guidelines (3) (4) is determined as follows:  Number of Sampling Points:           N=65536 Points  Resolution Ratio (?F/Fres):       Nx=16425  Sampling Rate:             Fs=109.961049389374 Msps  When using this condition, the target signal would be under-sampled in the way Figure 5 illustrates. The main lobe of the 7 Gbps 127-bit PRBS signal consists of 127 tones below 7 GHz at regular intervals as (a) illustrates.

Figure 5  Frequency Structure of Under-sampled Target Signal  Table 1 shows some of the tone frequencies and aliased bin locations calculated by the extended coherent Equation (2). The first tone is located at approximately 55.12 MHz, the second tone is located at approximately at 110.24 MHz and so on. The sampling rate of the waveform sampler is  approximately 110 Msps, so the baseband is approximately 55 MHz wide and the extended pages appear as Figure 5 (b) illustrates. Therefore, when all spectral tones are aliased in the baseband, the even numbered tones which have positive Mx in Table 1 would fall on the left-hand side and the odd numbered tones which have negative Mx would be aliased on the right-hand side of the baseband as Figure 5 (c) illustrates.

Table 1 Aliased Bin Locations of 7 Gbps 127-bit PRBS   2. Signal Processing Strategy 2.1 Reality of Jitter Influenced Signal The first experiment tested the 7 Gbps 127-bit PRBS signal containing a sinusoidal jitter of 5 kHz 200ps-pp.

Figure 6 Reconstructed Waveform and Eye (7 Gbps PRBS)  Figure 6 (a) shows the raw waveform measured by the waveform sampler with the condition described in the previous section. Then the waveform is reshuffled by the factor of Nx (=16425), reconstructing the PRBS waveform shown in (b). There are 254 UIs captured, so it displays approximately 36.3 ns (=254/7GHz) of the period.

Actually, it takes approximately 596 us (=65536/110MHz) for the waveform sampler to complete the capture. So the      Lecture 4.3                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                        4   actual measured period contains approximately three cycles of the 5 kHz jitter waveform. Consequently the reconstructed trace is greatly blurred and collapsed by the jitter as (c) shows. Finally, the waveform (b) is reshuffled by the factor of 127, generating an eye pattern as shown in (d); however no eye opening can be found at all because the trace is extremely blurred. This is the influence of the slow jitter on the measurement made by a waveform sampler.

A sampling oscilloscope usually integrates a CDR (Clock Data Recovery) capability to follow slow data clock fluctuations so that it can display clear signal traces.

However, waveform samplers in ATE usually do not integrate such functionality, so this problem cannot be resolved without a special post processing.

Figure 7   Spectrum of Jitter Influenced Signal (7 Gbps PRBS)   2.2 Spectrum of Jitter Influenced Signal Applying the FFT directly to the measured waveform, Figure 7 discloses the frequency spectrum of the jitter influenced signal as estimated in Figure 5 (c). The odd numbered tones are located on the right-hand side and the even numbered tones are located on the left-hand side in the baseband. Figure 7 (b) (c) (d) and (e) are close up views of the areas marked (P) (Q) (R) and (S) in (a). Mx numbers are printed besides each tone. The tone spacing is 164 units of sampler resolution so the distance corresponds  to approximately 275 kHz. Each tone actually looks modulated by the jitter. As (c) and (d) clearly indicates, it looks like a typical PM spectrum. Therefore, in order to recover a clear waveform trace, you need to remove the modulation effect of the jitter.

2.3 Equation of Carrier Tone Recovery Jitter is a kind of phase modulation (PM) to each tone of the multi-tone. Let?s denote a tone as cos(?t+?), where ? and ? are the angular frequency and the phase of the carrier tone. The jitter influenced signal, that is the PM modulated tone, can be described as cos(?t+?+?(t)), where ?(t) (?0) is the PM component. It is required to process and recover the cos(?t+?) component from the measured signal of cos(?t+?+?(t)). For simple expression, let?s denote cos(?t+?+?(t)) as cos(?+?). So cos?  is what to be recovered. The signal sin(?+?) is the orthogonal component of the measured signal cos(?+?). Since ?(t)?0, considering the approximation of cos?(t)?1 and sin?(t)?0, the PM modulated carriers can be modified as follows;  ???? ?????=+?  sincos sinsin)(coscos)cos(  ? ??? t  (5)  ?+?? ??+??=+?  cossin sincoscossin)sin(  ? ???  (6)  Equations (5) and (6) are modified respectively as follows;  ?++?=? sin)cos(cos ??    (7)  ??+?=? cos)sin(sin ??    (8)  Combining Equations (7) and (8), the carrier signal cos? is derived as follows;  { } ??+?++?=  ??+?++?= ?++?=?  cos)sin()cos( cos)sin()cos(  sin)cos(cos  2???? ????  ?? (9)  )sin()cos(cos)1( 2 ???? +?++?=?+  (10)  Finally the carrier cos?=cos(?t+?) is resolved as follows;  2)(1 ))(sin()())(cos(  )cos(  t ttttt  t  ? ???????  ??  + +++++=  + (11)  This equation is the key to recover the original carrier.

Herein cos(?t+?+?(t)) corresponds to each one of the PM modulated spectrum groups of measured signal. In order to resolve cos(?t+?) using Equation (11), the PM component ?(t) and the orthogonal component sin(?t+?+?(t)) must be calculated first. Therefore two pieces of data processing are required for resolving Equation (11). One is the PM demodulation for ?(t), and the other is the generation of orthogonal component sin(?t+?+?(t)) from the measured signal cos(?t+?+?(t)).

Lecture 4.3                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                        5   2.4 PM Demodulation The original measured waveform is a multi-tone. Since each one of the tones is actually PM modulated here, the demodulation processing of Equation (11) should be performed on each modulated tone. Figure 8 describes the procedure in detail. First, the FFT transforms the measured waveform (a) into the multi-tone spectrum as (b). Second, a single tone-group is extracted from the multiple tone- groups as (c). Third, the extracted spectrum group is converted into a waveform by the IFFT (Inverse FFT) as (d), and which is finally demodulated by the orthogonal demodulation method (ODM). [5]   Figure 8 Extraction of Jitter Influenced Tone Group    Figure 9 PM Demodulation by ODM  Figure 9 illustrates the ODM from the spectrum point of view. The red circled part of processing (a) (b) (c) and (d) is performed in the time domain. The reference cosine and sine waveforms in (b) are mathematically generated array data in the computer program. The frequency of the cosine and sine exactly equals the target carrier frequency ? which is the aliased frequency in the baseband. This can be calculated by the test condition. The generated cosine and sine waveforms are respectively multiplied by the extracted tone group waveform. Then each of them is clearly split into the low frequency component and twice the carrier frequency component as (c), so the low pass filtering (LPF) can extract the low frequency components x and y respectively as (d) illustrates. Finally the arctangent of y/x derives the PM component ?(t) in Equation (11).

Figure 10 (a) shows the demodulated phase trends for the odd number tones: 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 of Figure 7 (a); Figure 10 (b) shows the phase trends for the even number tones: 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 of Figure 7 (a). They have exactly the same frequency, but the odd and the even number groups are exactly out-of-phase each other. According to Table 1, the even numbered tones have positive Mx, and the odd numbered tones have negative Mx. However, their amplitudes are proportional to the original tone numbers.

The amplitude of tone number k is k times the amplitude of tone number 1.

Figure 10 Demodulated Phase Trend  As Figure 7 (a) shows, each tone level gradually reduces so the lower the tone level, the more difficult accurate demodulation becomes.  In order to avoid recovering inaccurate trends from the small level tones, phase trends demodulated from the major level tones are normalized and averaged. Figure 10 (c) shows the averaged phase trend based on the top 76 tones in this particular example.

The amplitude is normalized to the first tone. There is clearly a 3-cycle jitter trend.

2.5 Orthogonal Component Generation Further processing is required to solve Equation (11). The component sin(?t+?+?(t)) needs to be derived from the measured component cos(?t+?+?(t)). Equation (12) simply shows that sin ? can be generated by rotating cos ? by -90 degrees.

??? sin)  cos( =?     (12)  xjyyjxj ??=?+?? )()(    (13)  The -90 degree rotation is actually equivalent to multiplying -j to the complex spectrum component in the frequency domain. Equation (13) indicates that -j multiplication is first exchanging the real and the imaginary parts and then the imaginary part of the result is negated. Consequently the -90 degree rotation processing can be realized as illustrated in Figure 11. [6] This processing is performed in the frequency domain and      Lecture 4.3                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                        6   finally the spectrum is converted back to the waveform by the IFFT.

Figure 11 Signal Processing of -90 degree Rotation   2.6 Total Signal Processing Scheme The PM demodulation and the -90 degree rotation are discussed in the previous sections. The point is that these operations should be performed on each one of the multi- tone line groups. Figure 12 illustrates the schematic of total signal processing for recovering the clear waveform and eye pattern. After processing with Equation (11), the reconstructed waveform is distorted as the pulse width gets narrower, the smaller the amplitude becomes. Therefore the waveform should be subjected to a kind of equalization.

The power of each recovered carrier is compensated to restore the original power of the PM modulated state.

Figure 12 includes this processing. The effect will be shown in detail in the next section.

Figure 12 Flow of Waveform & Eye Reconstruction  3. Experimental Results 3.1 Refined Waveform and Eye Pattern Equation (11) is applied to each one of the tones. The averaged phase trend in Figure 10 (b) is proportionally scaled according to the tone number and incorporated in the processing. Then the reconstructed PRBS waveform looks refined with the thin trace as Figure 13 (a). Its spectrum appears organized as (b). However, the amplitude of the narrow pulses is smaller than expected.

This is because the power of the spectrum is not adjusted  well frequency-wise. The PM modulation makes the carrier energy spread out around the original carrier location. The power of recovered single tone on Equation (11) is different from the original power.

Figure 13 Recovered Waveform & Spectrum (7 Gbps PRBS)    Figure 14 Power Compensated Waveform & Spectrum  By collecting the signal power of each tone group in Figure 8, the original power of each carrier can be restored.

Consequently the reconstructed signal is improved as Figure 14 illustrates.

Figure 15 PRBS Waveform & Eye (7 Gbps PRBS 127 bits)       Lecture 4.3                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                        7   Figure 15 contrasts the original blurred PRBS waveform (a)(b) and the final refined waveform (c)(d). The PRBS is dramatically refined. When reshuffling the waveform (c), a big open eye pattern is restored as (e).

3.2 Different Conditions Let?s verify the effect in different conditions. Figure 16 shows the 6 Gbps 127-bit PRBS with a 5 kHz 100 ps-pp jitter. Because of changing the bit rate, the FFT spectrum (b) of the measured waveform looks totally different from the case of 7 Gbps depicted in Figure 7 (a).

Figure 16 6 Gbps 127-bit PRBS with Jitter 5 kHz 100 ps-pp  Figure 17 shows the 5 Gbps 63-bit PRBS with 5 kHz 200 ps-pp jitter. Both the bit rate and the PRBS length are changed. So the spectrum allocation in (b) looks totally different from the previous examples.

The sampler used in this work covers bandwidth up to 10 GHz. When testing 7 Gbps 127-bit PRBS stream, 181 tones are accommodated in the 10 GHz band. When testing 6 Gbps 127-bit PRBS and 5 Gbps and 63 bits, 212 and 126 tones are accommodated respectively in the band.

As Figures 7 (a), 16 (b) and 17 (b) show, the spectrum allocation looks greatly different in an under-sampling situation. There are lots of possible numbers available for Nx in Equation (4). So you need to look for as good a number of Nx as possible for appropriate tone separation, that is as equal space of target spectral lines as possible.

You may need to perform some trial measurements to find a well distributed spectrum condition.

In Figures 16 and 17, the blurred waveforms and the eye patterns are successfully refined at the end by the processing described in Section 2 based on Equation (11).

Figure 17 5 Gbps 63-bit PRBS with Jitter 5 kHz 200 ps-pp  Figure 18 shows a more practical example that is an emulation of SSC applied bit stream. The test signal is the 7 Gbps 31-bit PRBS, which is frequency modulated (FM) with a 31.5 kHz triangle signal. The frequency deviation is programmed as 0.01% of the bit rate that is 700 kHz.

Figure 18 (a) is the primitive measured waveform, which is directly processed by the FFT, disclosing the frequency spectrum as (b). Since the test signal is generated by using a UHF AWG (arbitrary waveform generator), the programmed PRBS waveform is intentionally limited its spectrum into the main lobe only. So there are 31 tones captured in the baseband. The sampling rate is tuned up to make every tone distributed evenly in the baseband. Each tone is numbered from 1 to 31. Each tone is FM modulated.

The bin #31 corresponds to the bit clock and it is the most deviated of all. Reshuffling the primitive waveform (a) by manner of CWR with the key number Nx, the two sequences of the PRBS waveform is reconstructed as (c).

Since the measurement is greatly influenced by the SSC, the recovered PRBS waveform looks too smeared to see a clear trace. As discussed in Section 2.4, performing the PM demodulation and further processing, the phase trend is disclosed as (d). Then the differential of the phase trend reveals the triangle frequency trend as (e), whose spectrum is shown in (f). The triangle frequency is 31.5 kHz and the frequency deviation is 700 kHz-pp. As cleaning up the SSC trend according to the procedures discussed in the      Lecture 4.3                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                        8   previous sections, the smeared waveform (c) is refined to the clear trace as (g). Finally, it is reshuffled by the key number 31, the big open eye is reconstructed as (h).

Figure 18 7 Gbps 31-bit PRBS with 31.5 kHz Triangle SSC   4. Discussion and Limitation The waveform sampler used in this work has an analog bandwidth (ABW) of 10 GHz and an actual sampling rate (Fs) of 110 Msps. All signal tones in the ABW should be captured in the baseband of 55 MHz. When it captures 65536 points (N) of data, the primitive frequency resolution is Fs/N that is approximately 1.7 kHz. So jitter more than several kHz can be removed appropriately.

Figure 19 shows a part of Figure 7, illustrating the close- up primitive spectrum. Each tone is scattered by the jitter.

The tone spacing is approximately 275 kHz wide so that the PM spread spectrum up to +/-138 kHz would not cross over each other. Then jitter up to 138 kHz can be removed in this situation. If you need to remove specific jitter frequency, you could apply a LPF processing in the PM demodulation scheme.

Figure 19 Acceptable Modulation Range  The number of bits of a PRBS corresponds to the number of tones contained in the main lobe or a side lobe of its spectrum. Therefore the bit rate of PRBS decides the way of multi-tone spectrum distribution. The ABW of the waveform sampler determines how many tones would be captured in the measurement. If you select an available sampler in an ATE, the ABW and Fs are given. Then the number of bits and the bit rate of the test signal PRBS should be carefully examined when making a test plan.

Table 2 shows how many tones would be considered in the ABW of 10 GHz. The table says that the lower the bit rate, the more tones are captured in the baseband, which means the tone spacing becomes narrower for the fixed baseband width. On the other hand, the shorter the PRBS length, the fewer tones will be in the baseband.

Table  2 Number of Tones to Be Accommodated  In general, you should use a waveform sampler with as high an actual sampling rate as possible for expanding the baseband width. Then if you want to increase the tone spacing, reduce the PRBS length. The available tone space determines the recoverable jitter frequency and amplitude or the frequency deviation of SSC.

Waveform samplers utilize aliasing to measure UHF signals. In under-sampling situation, jitter higher than half the sampling rate cannot be distinguished from the original existing jitter in the baseband.

5. Conclusion Mixed signal ATE integrates a wideband waveform sampler which is a very useful resource to measure UHF      Lecture 4.3                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                        9   signals including high-speed digital waveforms. Unlike high-end oscilloscopes, ATE usually does not have CDR capability integrated into the hardware. While a waveform sampler performs under-sampling of the test signal, the captured waveform is influenced by slow jitter. The purpose of this work is to remove slow jitter effects such as SSC in a high-speed digital signal and restore a fine waveform and eye pattern. The test signal is a PRBS bit stream. Slow jitter reduction is realized by post processing, whose steps are:  PRBS becomes extremely wideband multi-tone.

Jitter is PM onto each tone.

Original tones can be recovered by Equation (11) which is constructed by the modulation signal (?), the measured signal (cos(?+?)) and its orthogonal signal (sin(?+?)).

Each modulated tone is extracted as a group and demodulated by the ODM, recovering the modulation signal (?).

The sin(?+?) is generated by ?90 degree rotation from the cos(?+?). The FFT & IFFT method takes care of this processing.

Recovered tones are equalized power-wise to their original modulated state.

CWR by the factor of Nx reconstructs a PRBS waveform.

A second CWR by the factor of the number of bits (eg. 127) constructs an eye pattern.

Finally the developped processing procedure succeeded to reconstruct clear refined PRBS waveforms and wide open eye patterns. The key in the processing is that Equation (11) is derived as a relatively simple combination of acceptable processing components. This paper mainly discussed an example of a 7 Gbps 127-bit PRBS signal  containing a jitter of 5kHz. The waveform sampler employed in the experiment has an actual sampling rate of 110 Msps and the ABW of 10 GHz. Reduction of slow jitter and SSC is demonstrated in the examples. The multi- tone spectrum appearance in under-sampling situation greatly depends on the PRBS bit length and the bit rate of the signal. The sampling condition should be carefully chosen for the aliased multi-tone spectra to fall in the baseband with as even spacing as possible to avoid overlapping of the jitter-modulated spectrum with each other. If the Fs and ABW of sampler are given, the higher the PRBS bit rate and the shorter the PRBS bit length, the better for wider tone spacing.
