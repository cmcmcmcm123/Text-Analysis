Mining Direct and Indirect Association Patterns with Multiple Minimum Supports

Abstract?Association rules mining is one of the important tasks in data mining research. The key of mining association rules is to find out frequent itemsets based on the user- specified minimum support threshold, which implicitly assumes that all items in the data have similar frequencies.

This is often not the case in real-life applications. If the frequencies of items vary a great deal, we will encounter the dilemma called the rare item problem. In this paper, an efficient algorithm to discover association patterns with multiple minimum supports is proposed. The algorithm can not only discover association patterns forming between frequent items, but also discover association rules forming between requent items and rare items or among rare items only. Moreover, an algorithm for mining direct and indirect association patterns with multiple minimum supports is designed simultaneously.

I.  INTRODUCTION The association rule is an important topic in the data  mining and knowledge discovery research field. A large number of algorithms have been proposed to improve the running time for generating association rules and frequent itemsets since the problem was pointed out by R. Agrawal in 1993 [1][2].

With the further research on the mining of frequent patterns, it has been recognized that some infrequent patterns can provide very useful insight view into the data set, and a new kind of knowledge discovery problems called as indirect associations has been proposed [3]. Consider a pair of item x and y, which are rarely present together in the same transaction. If both items are highly dependent on the presence of another itemsets M, then the pair of x and y is said to be indirectly associated by M called as mediator.

Since the indirect association patterns discovery problem has been proposed, we call traditional association rules as direct association patterns for convenience in this paper.

The key of mining both of direct and indirect association patterns is to find out frequent itemsets based on the user- specified minimum support threshold, which is used to prune the search space and to limit the number of rules generated.

Just like pointed out with Liu [4], using only a single minimum support threshold implicitly assumes that all items in the data have similar frequencies in the database. This is often not the case in real-life applications. In many  applications, some items appear frequently in the data, while others appear rarely. If the frequencies of items vary a great deal, we will encounter the dilemma called as the rare item problem. If minsup is set too high, we will not find those rules that involve rare items in the data. If minsup is set too low in order to find rules that involve both frequent and rare items, it will cause combinatorial explosion because those frequent items will be associated with one another in all possible ways and many of them are meaningless. In order to deal with the rare item problem, Liu [4] extend the existing association rule model to allow user to specify a different minimum item support for each item, which is calculated for each item based on the percentage of its support. This percentage-based approach can improve the performance over single minsup based approaches [4]. However, it still suffers from both ?rule missing? and ?rule explosion? problems because the minimum item support for each item is calculated by its support multiplied with a uniform percentage. If minsup for the item is fixed by setting the percentage value high, the rare itemsets are missed as the minsup for the rare items becomes close to their support, and if minsup for the item is fixed by setting the percentage value low, the number of frequent itemsets explodes. In other words, the association rules model with the percentage-based multiple minimum supports has the same rare item problem with the existing association rule model with a single minimum support.

In order to resolve this dilemma, we use a monotonous  decreasing power function such as x  instead of the  constant percentage to multiply with the support of each item for calculating the minimum item support. By doing so, the difference between the minimum item support for each item and its support will vary in a satisfying way. For the frequent items, the difference is small; for the rare items, the difference is large. Thus, the minimum item support for frequent item is slightly less than its support, and the minimum item support for rare item is much lower than its support. The number of frequent itemsets will not explode; the rare itemsets will not be missed.

A mining algorithm proposed in this paper is to discover both direct and indirect association patterns with multiple minimum supports. The algorithm is different from existing indirect association patterns discovery algorithms in two aspects. Firstly, we use infrequent itemsets to find indirect association patterns. Secondly, the algorithm is designed to     find both direct and indirect association patterns with multiple minimum supports. The overall efficiency of our algorithm has been improved.

The paper is organized as follows. The definitions for indirect association pattern and multiple minimum supports are given in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe how to find both direct and indirect association patterns with multiple minimum supports, and Section 4 presents our experimental results. The conclusion and future works are made in the last section.



II. PROBLEM DEFINITION  A.  Definition of indirect association Let I = {i1, i2, ? ,im} be a set of literals called items. Let  the database D = { t1, t2, ? ,tn } be a set of n transactions, where each transaction is a subset of I. A non-empty subset of I is called itemset. An itemset containing k items is called k-itemste. The support of an itemset X denoted as sup(X) is defines as the fraction of all transactions containing X in D.

An itemset is frequent if its support is greater than a user- specified threshold minimum support.

Definition 1: A pair of items x and y is said to be indirectly associated via a mediator sequence M, if the following conditions are satisfied:  (1) sup({x,y})<ts; (2) There exists a non-empty set M such that:  (a) sup({x}?M)>=tf, sup({y}?M)>=tf, (b) dep({x},M)>=td, dep({x},M)>=td, where  dep(A,B) is a measure of the dependence between itemsets A and B.

The thresholds ts, tf and td are called itempair support threshold, mediator support threshold, and dependence threshold, respectively. We usually set tf >= ts in practice.

In this paper, we use the denotation x?y(M) to represent the indirect association pattern between item x and y via mediator M, and use the IS measure [5] as the dependence measure for condition 2(b). Given a pair of itemsets A and B, its IS measure can be computed as the following equation:  )()( ),(),(  BPAP BAPBAIS  ? =  where P represents the probability that the given itemsets appears in the transaction database.

A typical algorithm for mining indirect association patterns is shown as follows.

Algorithm: INDIRECT for Mining indirect associations  1. Discover all frequent itemsets L1 , L2 ,? , Ln using Apriori, Lk (k=1,2, ? ,n)where is the set of all frequent i-itemsets.

2. SIA = ?; //set of indirect associations 3. for k = 2 to n { 4.    Ck+1 = join(Lk, Lk); 5.    for each <x, y, M> ? Ck+1 { 6.       if (sup(x, y)<ts AND dep({x},M)>=td  AND dep({x},M)>=td)  7.         SIA = SIA ? {<x, y, M>}; 8.       } 9.    }   The algorithm is divided into two major phases: (1)get all  frequent itemsets using Apriori (step 1); (2) discover all indirect associations by candidate generation (step 4) and candidate pruning (step 5~8).During the candidate generation step, frequent itemset Lk is used to generate candidate indirect associations Ck+1 for pass k+1.Each candidate in Ck+1 is a triplet <x,y,M>, where x and y are the items which are indirectly associated by mediator M. Ck+1 is generated joining the frequent itemsets in Lk. During the join, a pair of frequent itemsets {x1,x2, ? , xk} and { y1,y2, ? , yk } are joinable if the two itemsets have exactly k-1 items in common.If so,they generate a candidate indirect association <x, y, M>, where x and y are the different items,one from each k-itemset, and M is the set of common items. For example, two itemsets {a,b,c,d} and {a,b,d,e} can be joined together to generate a candidate indirect association <c,e,{a,b,d}>. Since the candidate indirect associations are generated by joining two frequent itemsets, they certainly satisfy the mediator support condition.

Therefore, in the candidate pruning step,only the itempair support condition and mediator dependence condition are needed to be checked.

There are two join steps in the INDIRECT algorithm.

One is in the first phase for generating the candidate frequent itemsets using Apriori. In Apriori, the join step is used to generate candidate frequent itemsets for pass k+1 from the frequent itemsets in Lk. The other join step is for generating indirect associations Ck+1 from Lk. Both the two join steps are quite expensive. Qian Wan argued in [4] that the join step for generating indirect associations is more expensive than the one in Apriori because the items in an indirect itempair x and y do not have to be the last item ni each frequent itemset.

In fact, we can sort all itemsets in lexicographic order just like doing in Apriori, then combines the two itemsets that have identical k-1 prefix items. If doing so, some frequent itemsets may not be used to generate candidate indirect association, but the candidate indirect association between the same itempair will also be generated, the only difference is the mediators of the two candidate indirect association are different. For example, two itemsets {a,b,c,d} and {a,b,d,e} can not be joined together to generate a candidate indirect association <c,e,{a,b,d}> since they do have identical 3 prefix items. However, two itemsets {a,b,c} and {a,b,e} can not be joined together to generate a candidate indirect association <c,e,{a,b}> since they do have identical 2 prefix items. With the view of intuition, the indirect association created by minor mediator is more practical in the real applications. Based on this observation, the core operations of the two join steps in the INDIRECT algorithm can be the same. So, we can discover the indirect associations between itempairs while mining the frequent itemsets with Apriori algorithm, and put forward a mining algorithm to find both direct and indirect associations.

B.  Definition of multiple minimum supports In multiple minimum supports model, every item ij of the  itemset I={i1,i2,....,im} has been assigned a minimum item support based on its support value sup(ij), denoted as mis(ij),and LS is denoted as least minimum support.

Definition 2: the minimum item support of an item ij is defined as   otherwise  LS )m(i if      )( )( j  ? ? ? >  = LS  im imis jj  )sup( 1)sup()(  j jj i  iim ?=  Definition 3: the minimum support for an itemset X is the minimum of minimum support of the items contained in the itemset, denoted as mis(X).

Definition 4: An itemset X is said to be frequent if )()sup( XmisX ? .



III. MINING BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT ASSOCIATION PATTERNS MULTIPLE MINIMUM SUPPORTS  According to the definitions of direct association and indirect association multiple minimum supports, and based on the observation about candidate indirect association in last section, we put forward a algorithm to discover both direct and indirect association patterns multiple minimum supports, denoted as MDIAPMS.

The algorithm generates frequent itemsets by making multiple passes over the data set. However, in contrary to single minsup approaches which follow ?downward closure property? (all the subsets of a frequent itemset are frequent), multiple minimum support approaches follow ?sorted closure property? [4]. Let Ck denote the set of candidate k- itemset and Fk denote the set of frequent k-itemset. Note that the items in an itemset are arranged in increasing order of their MIS values from left to right.

Fk; (22)     } (23)  SDA = Construct(FreS);  End.



IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS To study the performance of our proposed algorithms we  have done several experiments. The computation environments are Pentium 3.0GHz, memory of 2G, operating system of Windows XP. The algorithm MDIAPMS and INDIRECT are implemented with C++. The synthetic experiment data set is generated by Assocgen [2] program of IBM Almaden research center. The meanings of used parameters are showed in Table 1.

It demonstrates that the algorithm increases with the declining of min_supp(or least minimum support).

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS A mining algorithm to discover both direct and indirect  association patterns with multiple minimum supports from large transaction databases is proposed in this paper. We have compared the algorithm with the previously known INDIRECT algorithm using synthetic data set. The experiments demonstrated that the algorithm is efficient and scalable, and outperforms the INDIRECT algorithm.

In the future, we will study how to find both direct and indirect fuzzy association patterns by using fuzzy set theory.

Incremental algorithm for mining both direct and indirect  association patterns from evolving transaction databases is also an interesting research work.
