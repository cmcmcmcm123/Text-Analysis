I.  INTRODUCTION As computer technologies become more ubiquitous, besides  numerical and categorical data, various digitalized images, sounds, voices, and videos have become part of daily life.

Plenty of knowledge can be hidden in these data, it is since 1970th people devoted themselves into image retrieval research, then text based image retrieval technology and context web retrieval technology were proposed, which in a certain extent solved some image retrieval and resource discovery problems. However, people are not satisfied with only being able to access information, because through image retrieval people can only find out the relative information they want, they can?t dig out valuable knowledge hidden in large sets of image data. Thus, image mining was introduced, Image mining concerns the extraction of implicit knowledge, image data relationship, or other patterns not explicitly stored in the images. It is more than just an extension of data mining to image domain. Image mining is an interdisciplinary endeavor which draws upon expertise in computer vision, image understanding, data mining, machine learning, database, and artificial intelligence.



II. CHARACTERISTICS OF IMAGE MINING As an interdisciplinary research field, Image mining has  its own characteristics as follows:  A. Dependence on spatial information Spatial information is vital for interpretation of image  content but there isn?t such requirement in traditional data mining.

B. Dependence on knowledge of a specific field Interpretation of image contents is achieved through high-  level semantic, which is produced by knowledge reasoning.

Thus, merely by using low-level global visual content features, such as color, texture, shape, is not sufficient for expressing  high-level semantic information correctly, which brings around a ?semantic gap? problem, a lot of knowledge of a specific field is needed to solve this problem.

C. Various interpretations for visual mode For the same visual mode, there has multiple interpretations  for it, usually special field experts are needed to take part in the interpretation process.

D. Complexity of the image mining process Image Mining not only analyzes and discovers a mode, but  it also has to deal with the operations related to mining system such as image retrieval, indexing, and storing, which play important roles in the final mining results, all this processes add difficulties to image mining.



III. OVERALL PROCESS OF IMAGE MINING Image mining is just at its infancy, however, observing  from some of the existing image mining systems, overall process can be divided into the following parts:  A. Data preprocess There exist a lot of dirty and noisy data in large image  databases, for instance, images that are extremely unclear and images that are already breached. Those data often cause chaos in mining process and give birth to bad mining results, so it is necessary to preprocess data, clean up the noisy, broken, dirty data.

B. Extracting multi-dimensional feature vectors Using image processing technologies such as image  segmentation, picking up the edge to extract task-related feature vectors, form multi-dimensional feature vectors.

C. Mining on vectors and acquire high-level knowledge Various methods such as object recognition, image  indexing and retrieval, image classification and clustering, neural network are used on feature vectors for mining and acquiring hidden and valuable high-level knowledge, then evaluate and explain that knowledge.



IV. MAIN TECHNOLOGY ANALYZE  A. Preprocessing Image mining deals with large collection of image  datasets that are high-dimensional and have multiple features, so time and space cost are relative high when analysis them. In order to improve quality and efficiency of the following mining   Computer Science & Education Hefei, China. August 24?27, 2010   ThP14.19       steps, it is vital to discover suitable preprocessing technologies to clean up the un-related data and make useful hidden information more obvious. Traditional image processing technologies are applied to the image data ready to be mined.

Some image preprocess has been introduced, for instance, Han propose a palm-print-based identification system in [1], the pre-processing steps including image-thresholding, border- tracing and wavelet-based segmentation, the preprocessing method is proved to be effective and can be simulated in other scenarios as well.

B. Feature extraction One of the key problems is how to express image data,  which can usually be represented by features such as texture, color, edge, shape. According to the mining object, extract the basic elements that can present the images, omit features inessential to mining result. In some cases, to get better mining result, it is necessary to converge many features to form multi- dimensional feature vectors. Color, edge, texture are very important features in image mining and are widely used. [2] presents a feature extraction method that uses a combination of features: color, edge, texture, the method achieves high recall and precision.

C. Image mining technology Most commonly used image mining technologies are image classification, image clustering, mining association rules and neural network.

1) Image classification Image classification is to do quantity analysis on image, and  , it is a supervised learning method, a set of pre-labeled images are provided, then based on prior knowledge, tag the new images with suitable labels, often there are three processes involved in image classification:(1): Feature extraction, first build up a image representation model, extract features from sample images that are already labeled and establish feature description for each image; (2): Train the samples of each class and establish model description for each class; (3): Use the model to classify and index images that are not labeled. The most commonly used image classification technologies are as follows: Bayes, neural network, decision tree, support vector machine, K-nearest -neighbor-classifier, genetic algorithm etc.

Performance of a classifier is normally measured by accuracy of prediction, speed, robustness, extensibility.

2)  Image clustering The process of grouping a set of images into classes of  similar images without prior knowledge is called image clustering. It is a unsupervised learning method, images within a cluster have high similarity in comparison to one another but are very dissimilar to images in other clusters. The process normally comprises of 4 steps: (1) Image representation, feature extraction and selection; (2) Set up similarity metrics suitable for special application; (3) Image clustering; (4) Form clusters. After clustering, field experts are required to examine each cluster and label it with abstract concepts. Nowadays there are many clustering algorithms such as: partitioning methods, hierarchical methods, grid-based methods, model-based methods, etc.

3) Association rules mining  Association rule mining finds interesting associations and correlation relationships among large set of image data.

Association rules show attribute value conditions that occur frequently together in a given dataset. Association rule mining consists of first finding frequent item sets, from which strong association rules are generated. These rules also satisfy a minimum confidence threshold. In recent years, association rule mining has become a heated problem and draws upon wide attention. Apriori is a typical algorithm for association rule mining, based on which there are a lot of improvement, for example, in [3], Anthony proposes a novel spatial mining algorithm to mine the spatial association rules from an image database, which prunes most of impossible candidates in the mining process, thus the proposed algorithm is more efficient than the Apriori algorithm. The experiment results show that it runs 2?5 times faster than the Apriori algorithm.



V. APPLICATION OF IMAGE MINING Image mining is a future trend, although it is a new research  area, its development shows great potential, as far as now its application has expanded to various domains and gained good results.

Mining on medical images is to acquire valuable knowledge and modes, which can later be used for discovering abnormal situations not consistent with the previous common modes. This can act as a reference and help doctors diagnose diseases. [4] presents a new image mining technique for brain tumor classification using pruned association rule, which combines the low-level features extracted from images and high level knowledge from specialists. The method can classify the CT scan brain images into three categories namely normal, benign and malign. It can assist the physicians for efficient classification with multiple keywords per image to improve the accuracy. The experimental result on pre-diagnosed database of brain images showed 96% and 93% sensitivity and accuracy respectively.

Image mining can also be used on satellite cloud imagery, Asanobu use SOM(Self-Organizing Feature Map) neural network to do image clustering on Typhoon image collections[5], and use the data mining methods to analysis typhoon patterns and predict typhoon. Edward etc apply a new clustering method and build up a system called RIME for detecting copying unauthorized image on the internet, the system first cluster similar images, then index each cluster, it achieves high accuracy[6].



VI. CONCLUSIONS Image mining is a promising field for research, however, it  is still at the beginning and for future development the following problems need to be considered:  ? Improvement on image preprocessing technologies, including feature extraction, image segmentation, object identification.

? Propose an united image representation model and representation techniques.

? Devise highly efficient and extensible image mining algorithms, for traditional techniques are hard to directly   ThP14.19       apply on image database.

? Introduce domain knowledge into image mining, which  are essential for understanding mining results.
