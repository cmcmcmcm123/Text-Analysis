Alert Correlation Model Design based on Self-regulate

Abstract?The multi-step attack is one of the primary forms of the current network intrusions. How to detect these attacks is an important aspect of IDS (Intrusion Detection System) research. The correlation research in intrusion detection performs mainly on the following aspects: reducing the false alert rate and omission rate; detecting unknown attacks; attack forecasting. Especially the development of the third point perhaps improves the passive detection to the active protection. Through the study on patterns of the multi-step attack, a model of alert correlation which is based on self-regulate is designed. This paper describes the definition and classification of alert correlation. Also it introduces the association rules. To improve efficiency of IDS,the paper applies data mining technology to IDS In the paper we present a method of how to acquire the intrusion knowledge from the logs and detect the intrusion behaviors based on the improved Apriori algorithm.

I.  INTRODUCTION Study on the network intrusion detection system began  in the 20th century, 80's, has been more than 20 years, however, the development of intrusion detection technology, is far from the objectives and expectations[1].

The current intrusion detection system still face the following problems: (1) lack of capacity for the accurate description of the attack (2) The IDS does not recognize the relevance of alert information, (3) lack of visualization for the study of alert information.

Therefore, it is necessary to make correlation and adjustment analysis on IDS alert information, to reduce false alert rate and omission rate; to concise alert information, and provide these higher-level security information such as the strategy and process of the intrusion in a visual form to the security administrator, and predict the next possible attack, so that administrators may take timely measures to put an end to the ongoing and imminent attacks.



II. COMPARISON AND ANALYSIS OF SEVERAL EXISTING CORRELATION METHODS  The current commonly used correlation methods are: the probability correlation method, alert correlation model of machine learning method, alert correlation methods based on the prerequisites and method based on aggregation and correlation component.

However, these methods have their shortcomings.

Probability correlation method can not find the associated information from the alert information with fewer characteristics and can not reflect the cause-and-effect relationship of the alerts.  for the Alert Correlation Model of machine learning methods, the data that does not exist in thread could not be associated with and this affects the accuracy of the final results of the analysis; The method based on the aggregation and correlation component has difficult in predicting intruder's behavior. Alert information associated method based on Prerequisites is only an off-line detection method, and it needs well understand for a variety of attack methods.[2]

III. DESIGN OF THE ALERT CORRELATION MODEL BASED ON SELF-REGULATE  Through the discussion of the correlation methods mentioned above, here we present an improved model: the alert correlation model based on Self-regulate. The improved model incorporates advantages of the associated component-based approach and alert information correlation based on pre-conditions.

A.   Theoretical Foundation 1) The definition of alert correlation  For distributed intrusion detection systems, alert information typically includes the following contents [3][4]: AID:Annunciator ID;TS:Time Stamp;AL:Alert Level; SI;Source;TI:Target.Where SI and TI are the structure types, containing the IP and PORT two domains.

Commonly forms of the alert correlation [5][6][7] are : a) Repetitive  Definition 1: For the two alert information A1 (AID,TS,AL,SI,TI) ,and A2 (AID,TS,AL,SI,TI) , If the properties satisfy the following conditons: A1.AL=A2.AL,A1.SI=A2.SI,A1.AID=A2.AID,A1.TI.IP= A2.TI.IP or A1.TI?A2.TI and |A1.TS-A2.TS|<?(? is a setted threshold),we claim that the relationship between A1 and A2 is ?Repetitive?or ?Duplication? .

b) Causal Relation Correlation Definition 2: The attack a has certain conditions to  take place, which is called attack premise (Prerequisite), isdenoted as Pre (a), the consequence effect of attack a,is denoted as Con (a).

Definition 3: For any two alert information Al (AID, TS, AL, SI, TI), and A2 (AID, TS, AL, SIC, TI), if the A1.SI = A2.SI, A1.TI = A2.TI, and the collection Con (A1) corresponds to the consequences effect set of A1, and collection of Pre (A2) corresponds to premise set of the attack A2 ,and exists the following relationship: Con (A1)   DOI 10.1109/MMIT.2010.60    DOI 10.1109/MMIT.2010.60    DOI 10.1109/MMIT.2010.60    DOI 10.1109/MMIT.2010.60     ?Pre (A2), we claim that A1 and A2 has a causal relationship.

c) Clustering Relations Definition 4: For any two alert information Al (AID,  TS, AL, SI, TI), and A2 (AID, TS, AL, SI, TI), if the A1.SI = A2.SI, A1.TI = A2 .TI, we claim that the relationship between Al and A2 is the ?Clustering Relations?. It also includes:  ? Source IP association: According to the attacks source IP address, the alerts are divided into some groups, the analyst can know which attack source is the most active, and if an IP address is reported by several IDS alert (or implicitly inclusive) as the attack source IP address, then this IP addresses has great possibility to be used by an attacker.

Especially when the same source IP address triggered a number of different security alert events.

? Destination IP association: the destination IP association is useful in identifying attack targets, if a system is constantly to be reported as a target, it is likely that it is actually really an attack destination.

? Attack type / name association: If the attacker uses multiple source IP addresses, then the IP addresses association may be invalid. At this time, association with attack name or type is still very valuable.

? Time-based association: if the data analyst has data of several days, he may implement time- based association. If the analysts find a peak period from the time that the alerts happens, which appears at a certain period of time of each day, it means that hackers maybe attack at this period of time these days.

2) The Definition of Association Rules Definition 5: Let I = (i1, i2, ..., im) ,is a collection of  items. Task-related data set D is a collection of database transactions, where each transaction T is a collection of items, and satisfies that T?I. set A is an item set, transaction T contains A, if and only if A?T, there exist:  ? The association rules are like implication formula A?B, which A?I, B?I, and A?B = ?;  ? Rules A?B  in the transaction set D ,with a support degree s, where s is a percentage of D containing A?B, that is, the probability P (A?B);  ? Rules A?B in the transaction set D, with a confidence degree c, if the ration of contains A to D contains B is c, the conditional probability is P (B | A). That is:support(A?B)=P(A?B), confidence(A?B)=P(B|A)  The support and confidence are two metrics, respectively, reflect the usefulness and certainty of the rules. The rules that satisfy the minimum supports threshold (min_sup, can be expressed as Smin) and the minimum confidence thresholds (min_conf, can be expressed as Cmin) at the same time are called strong rules.

A collection of items called item sets. If it meets the minimum support itemset, call it frequent item sets.

B. Algorithm Idea Mining association rules algorithm [8][9] has two main  steps to go: 1) To Identify All the Frequent Item Sets.

Through the user given minimum support to find all frequent item sets, that is, the item set which meet the support degreer of no less than min_sup. When the frequent item sets may have including relationships, to identify item sets that are not included in other frequent item set, and name it large item sets (Frequent Large Item Set).

2) To Generate Association Rules From the Frequent Item Sets.

With the user given minimum degree of confidence (min_con), looking for association rules no less than min_con confidence in each maximum frequent set.

For the extraction of frequent item sets we use the Apriori algorithm. The core of it is recursive algorithm based on a two-stage frequent set. The basic idea is that: firstly, generate candidate frequent item sets Lk +1from the smaller frequent item sets Lk So again and again, until all the frequent sets are found, and the appear frequency of these items set has at least the same value as the predefined minimum support degree. And then, to generate association rules by the frequent set and these rules must meet the minimum support degree and minimum confidence degree.

The core of Apriori algorithm is how to generate all the frequent item sets [10], which uses an iterative layer by layer approach, and we describe it in pseudo-code as follows:  Input: transaction database D; minimum support threshold min_sup.

Output: the frequent itemsets L in D.

L1={large 1-itemsets}; for(k=2;Lk-1??;k++){ Ck =apriori_gen(Lk-1,min_sup); //Generate the next candidate itemsets to be mined for all transactions t?D { Ct=subset(Ck,t); For all candidates c?Ct; c.count++;} Lk={c?Ck|C.count>=min_sup};} return L=?Lk; Algorithm calls the function apriori_gen (Lk-1,  min_sup) in order to generate k candidate sets from K-1 frequent item sets. It uses the following properties: (1)If X is a frequent item sets, then any non-empty subset X are frequent item sets; (2) If the X is not a frequent item set, then any superset of X are not frequent item sets. Pseudo- code described as follows:  for each item set Li?Lk-1{ for each item set Lj?Lk-1{ if((Li[1]=Lj[1])&&(Li[2]=Lj[2])&&?&&(Li[k-2]=  Lj[k-2])&&( Li[k-1]< Lj[k-1])){ c= Li join Lj;// Merge to Generating candidate item  sets if has infrequent-subset(c,Lk-1){ delete c;// Pruning process } else insert c to C:} } }return C;     we call infrequent_subset (c, L) is to determine whether the c is needed to be added to candidate set k .the algorithm is as follows:  for each item sets(k-1) subset s of c if(s?Lk-1){ return TRUE;} return FALSE; Due to the high complexity of the classic Apriori  algorithm ,for n item sets, if n is large, an alerting number of candidate item set will be generated when merging, then a lot of pruning operations will be needed , and result in large memory cost  Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the algorithm. Since this raw data is based on the host log, therefore, the destination IP address is a fixed IP address of the server. Using the Apriori algorithm for IP addresses of different users, firstly, the set of logical log records are divided into disjoint blocks, consider one block once separately and generates all the frequent sets of it. Finally, calculate the final degree of support and confidence. This algorithm can be highly concurrent executed, the corresponding record for each IP address is allocated to a processor to generate the frequency set, produce the rules, and finally merge all the rules, filtering out the valid set of rules. This method greatly improves the speed of handling mass data. [11][12]  C. Construction of Function Modules Based on the above algorithm and filtered rules set  we design the relevant function modules, as shown in Fig.1.

1) Alert Information Pre-processing Module  Different Underlying types of IDS will package set of the original alert message and sent it to the alert information pre-processing module, and alert information pre-processing module will convert different IDS alert information to uniform format (AID, TS, AL, SI, TI, StartTime, EndTime). The parameters are stated as following:  AID is for the IDS number;TS is for the alert time stamp; AL is numbered corresponding to the vulnerability of attack type number, using CVE numbers to unify the representation of attack type ;SI is for the attack source address information, including IP address and port two properties, TI is as the target address information, including IP address and port two properties; StartTime is start time of the attack, is initialized with the value of the assignment for of the TS, EndTime is end time of the attack, is initialized as the value of the assignment for the TS.

After processing large number of the original alert information set, this module will convert the standard information to establish the standard pattern data structure, and save them into the files, waiting for the alert information merge module to process.

2) Alert Information Merge Modules Alert information merge module [13][14] is  responsible for re-merging the alert information that have duplicate relations and concurrent relations into new alert information.

Firstly, the alert information merge module read information from the outcome document of pre-processing module, and they are classified into different target sub- block according to the IP attributes of destination address information, and then are written into different files with IP as file name, respectively. And the following operations operate on each file separately.

The theoretical basis of this step is that the raw data is according to host-based alert logs, so the destination IP is the server IP, it is a small number. At the same time, due to the high complexity of Apriori algorithm, if all the information to be handled, the memory overhead is very large, we use disjoint sub-blocks to increase the speed of mass data processing. Because it is based on host alert logs, the distributed intrusion is less, we basically deem it as invasion from different hosts. Therefore, we improve the efficiency of algorithms at the same time did not significantly reduce the accuracy of results.

Then, we merge each alert log files. On the first ,we repeat the merge operation. For the two Alert information A1 (AID, TS, AL, SI, TI, Start Time, End Time), A2 (AID, TS, AL, SI, TI, Start Time, End Time), if (AID, AL, SI, TI) has the same value, and the | A1.TS-A2.TS | <?1 (?1 is a set duplicate threshold value ), then delete the alert information A2, and set properties in the A1 as following :A1.StartTime = min (A1.StartTime, A2.TS), A1.EndTime = max (A1.EndTime, A2.TS).The second step is to do concurrent merge operation. For the two Alert information A1 (AID, TS, AL, SI, TI, Start Time, End Time ),A2(AID, TS, AL, SI, TI, Start Time, End Time ), if (AL,SI,TI) has the same value , and | A1.TS-A2.TS | <?2 (?2 is set concurrency threshold value), then remove the warning letter A2, and make A1.StartTime = min (A1.StartTime, A2.StartTime), A1.EndTime= max (A1.EndTime, A2.EndTime), A1.TS = (A1.StartTime + A2.StartTime) / 2.

The theoretical basis of this step is the previously mentioned definition of classification of the alert associated form. Since the original alert messages has a large number of redundant alert information, which reducing the computing efficiency of the model and the time is wasted on redundant alert information processing, on the other hand, the important attack alert is submerged in the redundant alerts .

3) Alert Information Association Module Network intrusion behavior is often a series of attacks,  or combination attacks, these attacks are not isolated, but the performance of the different stages and the previous stage is to prepare for a later stage. Therefore, processes should be carried on the alert information to make the overall analysis. For example, if a hacker is going to attack a server, he would first locate the host, and launch IPSweep attacks, to determine whether there is such a host   Figure 1.  alarm correlation model based on the automatic adjustment     (IP); and then launch Sadmind_Ping attacks to see if this server has Sadmind loopholes, if yes, he can take advantage of this loophole to launch Sadmind_BOF buffer overflow attacks to gain Root access. He may also have further use of the Root permissions on the server to place Trojan horses, leaving the back door and so on. In the course of hacker attacks, IDS may generate a series of alert at each stage, but it can not know the relationship between the alerts, that is to say, attack strategy can not be revealed. This module is completed to show that the correlation between the warning information, and to point out the attackers characteristic sequences.

This module deals with alert information that has been processed by the two modules above, using the Apriori mining algorithm. In the process, the alert message sequence within each unit time T is deemed as an event, and be calculated with AL as the primary key. Different from the usual Apriori algorithm, this algorithm divides the alert information into several disjoint subsets, with destination IP as a unit, mining separately, and then associate the correlation rules set to generate the results- correlation rules set.



IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS In the experiment, we use a laboratory host as the  target machine which is setup with SNORT intrusion detection system, and then using other hosts to launch X- Scan scanning to it. The SNORT alert log within 40 minutes received is used as a sample. . Since the alert logs are based on the same IP, so we ignore the first step in the alert message merge module operation. Total number of alert information is 84, after the merge module merging redundant information, the number of the generated quasi- alert information is 30, and then using 300 seconds as the event separation time, 9 alert events are produced. For the different levels of support and confidence, the generated rule sets at last are different. As shown in table I.

Through the numbers in table I, we can see that the  support degree has great impact on the number of rules that generated, .For the samples in this experiment, support degree among 0.23 to 0.27 generate the relatively stable number of rules, in further experiments, we can select the degree of support = 0.25 as the initial support for instructions.



V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND FUTURE WORK In this Paper, we propose an alert correlation model  based on Self-regulate, aiming at solving the problems in the existing alert correlation technology. The model introduces the data mining technology into the alert correlation, and makes improvements on alert correlation technology using Apriori algorithm. By using sub-block  techniques, we not only adapt to the application of alert association and also are able to significantly reduce the algorithm complexity with small affect on the accuracy of results.

The essence of alert correlation is to process a large number of audit log. The purpose of data mining is to identify potential, unknown knowledge from the vast amounts of data, so it has great application advantages in alert correlation field. How to use the available attack mode to adjust the appropriate mining parameters and then to select the appropriate number of representative original audit data, and how to find a better algorithm for mining, these are the Future work.
