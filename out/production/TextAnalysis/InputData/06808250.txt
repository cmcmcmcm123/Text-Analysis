Utilizing Human Intelligence in a Crowdsourcing Marketplace for Big Data Processing

Abstract?Crowdsourcing emerging as a distributed problem-solving model can dispatch tasks to a large number of human workers. The workers? human intelligence can be utilized to execute tasks which cannot be efficiently performed by computer-based systems. A crowdsourcing environment supports various data processing tasks, for example, data collection, data annotation, data validation, data classification, and natural language processing. In particular, the crowdsourcing environment can be applied for big data processing as well. In this paper, we propose Human- Intelligence-as-a-Service (HIaaS) which is a cloud computing service model utilizing human intelligence in a crowdsourcing marketplace to process big data. We also propose an optimization model based on stochastic programming for provisioning human workers in a HIaaS-based marketplace.

Numerical studies are performed to evaluate the optimization model. A video rating system handling a big data set is an illustrative example analyzed in the studies. The results show that the model can efficiently reduce the cost to provision workers for processing a big data job.

I. INTRODUCTION  Data processing and data analysis techniques are applied to discover useful information and value inside a data set.

When traditional processing techniques cannot efficiently cope a data set due to its size, we could refer to such a data set as big data [1]. For processing big data efficiently, platforms and technologies (for example, Hadoop, HDFS, Hypertable, Hive, and Amazon Mechanical Turk) are sug- gested [2].

In this paper, we mainly focus on crowdsourcing for pro- cessing data. Basically, crowdsourcing can offer a distributed problem-solving environment where a number of humans are assigned to execute tasks [3]. In the crowdsourcing environ- ment, some problems could be less complex when solved by the human than when solved by the computer-based system.

Crowdsourcing has been applied for various data processing tasks, for example, data collection [4], data classification [5], data validation [6], data annotation [7], and natural language processing [8]. Amazon Mechanical Turk and InnoCentive are, for example, crowdsourcing environments where tasks (i.e., small job units) can be dispatched to human workers.

When the size of data becomes part of problems that a  conventional computer system cannot efficiently address, a crowdsourcing marketplace can be another source of big data processing power.

In this paper, we propose a service model, namely Human- Intelligence-as-a-Service (HIaaS). This model utilizes hu- man intelligence in a crowdsourcing marketplace for pro- cessing big data. By splitting big data to a number of tasks, tasks can be distributed to a crowd for processing in a parallel fashion. Software components required to operate the HIaas by a provider are recommended. This model also presents that two key types of workers, namely, on- demand and contract workers should be available in the crowdsourcing marketplace. Next, the paper proposes an optimization model, namely HIaaS Resource Provisioning Optimization (HRPO) based on stochastic programming [9].

We derive this HRPO primarily from a HIaaS customer?s perspective for minimizing the cost to provision workers processing big data from HIaaS providers. Numerical studies are performed to evaluate the HRPO. A video rating system handling a large number of video clips considered as a big data set is an illustrative example analyzed in the studies.

The results show that the HRPO can efficiently reduce the cost to provision workers for processing the big data job.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II presents an overview of the HIaaS model. Section III de- scribes the system model and assumption. The proposed optimization model of the HRPO is discussed in Section IV.

Section V presents the numerical studies to evaluate the HRPO. The paper is summarized in Section VI.



II. OVERVIEW OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE AS A SERVICE  In Fig. 1, the architectural layers of cloud com- puting services are presented, i.e., Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Human-Intelligence-as-a-Service (HIaaS), Platform- as-a-Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).

The details of SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS layers can be found in [10]. The authors in [10] also mentioned the term ?Hu- man as a Service? (HuaaS) which is related to the HIaaS model. However, software components required to operate the HuaaS model were not proposed. Moreover, the HuaaS model did not address human resource provisioning for big data processing. In this paper, we propose the HIaaS model   DOI 10.1109/.112    DOI 10.1109/.112    DOI 10.1109/.112    DOI 10.1109/ICPADS.2013.113     Software-as-a-Service  Human-Intelligence-as-a-Service  Outsourcer Data repository Scheduler Recruiter  Platform-as-a-Service  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  Worktable Monitor Logger Biller  Figure 1: Layers of Cloud Computing Services.

specifically coined for big data processing in a crowdsourc- ing environment. We also propose software components forming basic building blocks of a HIaaS-based platform and derive an optimization model to provision human workers for processing big data jobs. The optimization model consid- ers uncertainties of availability of human workers, unit price of man-hour, and the number of big data tasks. To the best of our knowledge, human resource provisioning under the uncertainties for big data processing in the crowdsourcing environment has never been exclusively studied.

Basically, a HIaaS platform can be implemented on top of either Paas or IaaS. Later, software applications (e.g., scientific applications and SaaS) can be built on top of the HIaaS platform. Then, a HIaaS provider can provide programming libraries (i.e., APIs) or Web Services to soft- ware developers who are HIaaS customers for implementing applications that allow big data to be processed in the HIaaS provider?s platform.

With the HIaaS platform, a big data set of a job can be divided into a number of data chunks. Data chunks of the same job can be processed by a number of workers given the same function (e.g., image annotation and data classification) in a parallel fashion. A function with a data chunk can be referred to as a human intelligence task (HIT). Note that the term ?Human Intelligence Task (HIT)? is coined as the unit of work on Amazon Mechanical Turk [7].

The conceptual software components required to operate the HIaaS platform (shown in Fig. 1) are described as follows:  1) Outsourcer ? This component admits HITs from a HIaaS customer. The outsourcer also provides a mech- anism for the provider and the customer to nego- tiate prices to provision workers and service-level- agreement (SLA) to operate HITs before the HITs will be processed.

2) Data repository ? The results of processing HITs are stored in the data repository. Moreover, the customer can store data chunks of jobs in this data repository.

3) Scheduler ? Based on a scheduling policy, the sched-  uler assigns HITs to workers.

4) Recruiter ? The recruiter acts as a human resource  department recruiting workers for processing HITs.

5) Worktable ? This component provides an interface to a  worker. Through the interface, the worker can receive, display, and process a HIT, and then the worker can submit the HIT result to the data repository.

6) Monitor ? HITs are tracked by the monitor so that the HIaaS customer can check the progress and status of HITs. With the information from the monitor, the HIaaS provider can evaluate workers? performance and plan to provision workers as well.

7) Logger ? The logger records activities in the HIaaS platform for debugging and auditing purposes.

8) Biller ? This component can charge the HIaaS cus- tomer and (electronically) transfer remuneration to workers.

The implementation of a HIaaS platform will be ex- tensively addressed in the future work. Basically, all the software components of the platform can be deployed as Web Services so that service invocations to the components can be conveniently performed. Moreover, a job can be de- veloped as a MapReduce job which is specifically designed for processing large data sets [11]. With the MapReduce programming model, HITs can be map tasks or reduce tasks which can be assigned to workers by a master (i.e., the scheduler in Fig. 1). Hence, the HIaaS platform must provide APIs supporting MapReduce for such a job. In addition, a web application connecting to the worktable component can be provided to workers such that the workers can conveniently handle HITs. Fig. 2 depicts a process flow diagram representing flows starting from a HIaaS customer to five software components and a worker.



III. SYSTEM MODEL AND ASSUMPTION  In this section, we define the system model and assump- tion of a crowdsourcing marketplace where HIaaS providers exist. A single HIaaS customer is considered in the model.

The customer?s objective is to provision workers from HIaaS providers through both on-demand and contract options for processing HITs of jobs. Let ? denote the set of jobs. The total number of HITs of job ? is denoted by ?? . Let ?? be the deadline or the maximum amount of time required to complete every HIT of job ?. The amount of time to process a HIT is called processing time and its measurement unit is man-hour.

Let ? denote the set of HIaaS providers. Each provider employs workers for processing HITs. We assume that work- ers in HIaaS are skilful to perform HITs. It is assumed that the HIaaS provider defines SLAs to guarantee the processing time and quality for handling HITs from the customer. Let ??? denote the maximum processing time defined in the SLA to process a single HIT of job ? by provider ?. We assume that SLAs of all providers are not violated.

To simplify the model, the main objective of our proposed optimization model is only to minimize the human provi- sioning cost. Therefore, the cost of data transfer (including both downlink and uplink) between the customer and the providers are assumed to be neglected. We also assume that data chunks of all jobs are initially stored in a centralized storage (e.g., a FTP/HTTP host and cloud storage). When a HIT is processed by a worker, its associated data chunk will be instantly transferred from the storage to the worker. All results of HITs will be stored in the data repository (shown in Fig. 2). Next, the customer can retrieve the results anytime.

This paper ignores the cost to utilize the data repository.

Finally, the results of the HITs can be statistically analyzed through traditional MapReduce (e.g., Hadoop).

A. On-demand and Contract Options  Two options to process HITs are assumed to be available in HIaaS providers, namely on-demand and contract options.

These options are similar to the options available in IaaS providers (e.g., Amazon EC2 and Windows Azure). With the on-demand option, the customer can submit jobs to be processed, and then the cost is charged to the customer on a pay-per-use basis according to the real usage of processing time required for HITs (i.e., the number of used man-hours).

A HIaaS provider can adjust the number of workers and prices for the on-demand option according to the supply- and-demand of workers. For job ? processed in provider ?, let ??? and ??? denote the unit cost (i.e., $ per man-hour) and the number of available workers in the on-demand option, respectively.

With the contract option, the customer subscribes to a contract by stating the number of contract workers required for HITs, and then the unit cost of the contract option is fixed and generally cheaper than the on-demand option within a specific time duration called contract duration. Different contract durations (e.g., 7-day, 3-month, and 1-year dura- tions) can be available. The number of contract workers will be available only within the contract duration. Therefore, the customer can choose an appropriate duration and pay an upfront cost to obtain the cheaper unit price. Furthermore, the customer should provision the appropriate number of contract workers to hedge against risks of fluctuating price  and the unavailability of workers in the on-demand option.

In this paper, it is assumed that only one time duration is available and able to meet all the job deadlines. Let ??? denote the cost to hire a contract worker to process job ? in provider ?.

In practice, the contract option needs to be requested and signed by the customer in advance such as 1-month or 3- month early. With the advance request, the HIaaS provider can prepare the number of contract workers to meet the customer?s request. Contract workers will be reserved to work for certain contracts.

B. Uncertainty  It is possible that the number of HITs of a job cannot be known by the customer in advance. For example, at the moment when the customer purchased the contract option, the customer might not realize the actual number of HITs at the later moment when the signed contract has commenced.

Moreover, the unit price of man-hours and the number of workers in the on-demand option can fluctuate. Due to these uncertainties, it is not trivial to achieve the optimal solution to sign contract workers. Either over-subscription or under-subscription of a signed contract can occur. The over-subscription results in wasteful expenditure. In contrast, the under-subscription results in the higher cost to hire on- demand workers. Furthermore, the number of on-demand workers might not be sufficient to complete HITs and meet the deadline.

This paper addresses the uncertainties by deriving a stochastic programming optimization model [9]. With the model, all possible values of the uncertainty parameters are described by scenarios. Let ? denote the set of all scenarios.

Given job ? and provider ?, ???? = (???, ????, ????) denotes the random vector of scenario ? ? ? where ??? , ???? , and ???? denote the number of HITs, the number of available on-demand workers, and unit-price of on-demand option, respectively. Scenario ? is associated with a certain probability denoted by ?? . A probability distribution asso- ciated with scenarios in ? is assumed to be known. It is assumed that the probability distribution has finite support.

That is, ? has a finite number of scenarios with probability     ?? where ? ???  ?? = 1.

C. Decision Variables  Decision variables for the stochastic programming opti- mization model can be mapped into three groups, namely ??? ? ?, ???? ? 0, ???? ? 0. ? is the set of non-negative integers. Variable ??? denotes the number of contract workers to be hired through the contract option for job ? in provider ?. Under scenario ?, variable ???? denotes the number of man-hours to be utilized from the contract worker for job ? in provider ?. Under scenario ?, the number of contract workers could be deficient to process remaining HITs. Consequently, the number of man-hours denoted by ???? can be dynamically provisioned through the on-demand option.



IV. HIAAS RESOURCE PROVISIONING OPTIMIZATION  In this section, we propose the HIaaS resource provision- ing optimization (HRPO) based on the stochastic program- ming optimization model with two-stage recourse [9]. The objective function of the model is defined as follows:  Min ? ???  ? ???  ?????? + ?? [ Q(?, ?)  ] . (1)  The objective function in (1) is to minimize the cost to provision workers for processing big data jobs while the deadlines of the jobs can be met and the uncertainty are taken into account. Under the uncertainties described by sce- narios (i.e., ?), ??[?] denotes the expectation of costs paid for the on-demand option. ? denotes the composite variable consisting of all decision variables ??? . Given scenario ? and composite variable ?, function Q in (1) represents the cost to utilize the on-demand option as fully expressed as follows:  Q(?, ?) = Min  [? ???  ? ???  ????????  ] (2)  subject to: ??? ? ??? , ?? ? ?, ? ? ? (3) ??? ?  ? ???  ???? + ???? ???  , ?? ? ? (4)  ???? ? ????? , ?? ? ?, ? ? ? (5) ???? ? ??????, ?? ? ?, ? ? ? . (6)  In (2), function Q is a minimization problem consisting of four groups of constraints. The number of contract workers which can be provisioned by the customer is controlled by constraint (3) where ??? denotes the maximum number of contract workers which can be supplied by provider ? for job ?. Constraint (4) ensures that all the HITs will be processed.

Constraint (5) governs the utilization of contract workers.

Constraint (6) controls the number of man-hours which can be utilized through the on-demand option.

Next, the stochastic programming optimization model shown in (2)?(6) is transformed into the deterministic equiv- alence which can be efficiently solved by an optimization solver supporting mixed integer programming (for example, a solver available in NEOS [12]). The deterministic equiva- lence can be fully expressed as follows:  Min ? ???  ? ???  ?????? + ? ???  ? ???  ? ???  ??????????(7)  subject to: (3)  ??? ? ? ???  ???? + ???? ???  , ?? ? ? , ? ? ? (8)  ???? ? ????? , ?? ? ?, ? ? ? , ? ? ? (9) ???? ? ??????, ?? ? ?, ? ? ? , ? ? ?. (10)

V. NUMERICAL STUDIES  A. Illustrative Example  The proposed HRPO is evaluated by performing numer- ical studies. A video rating system (VRS) for a streaming media service is analyzed in the studies. The VRS has new numerous one-minute video clips in every month which can be considered as a big data set. The VRS needs to classify every clip to a specific rate. For example, there are four rates used in a television content rating system in Thailand (i.e., C, U, PG-13, and 18). Then, the VRS annotates each clip by listing at least four keywords or tags.

The average size of the one-minute video clip is 443.27 MB. Note that this video clip size is based on the H.264 720p format (with resolution = 1280x720 and frame rate = 30fps) and estimated by the Video Space Calculator [13].

In every 3 months, the average number of video clips gathered by the VRS is 216,416. That is, 96TB of storage capacity is required. Currently, a computer-based system cannot efficiently process such a big data set. The VRS is then considering a HIaaS-based crowdsourcing marketplace.

B. Parameter Setting  Only one job is considered (i.e., ?? ? = 1). A HIT of the job consists of both rating and annotation functions. It is assumed that the VRS is going to apply HIaaS for the next big data set only. The number of HITs (i.e., the number of video clips) is not known in advance. For example, the VRS needs to purchase the contract option a month early before the actual number of HITs will be realized so that the provider can prepare the sufficient number of contract workers required by the VRS. The probability distribution of the number of HITs can be obtained from historical data.

A probability distribution used in [14] is applied for the probability distribution of the number of HITs and depicted in Fig. 3(c).

Two HIaaS providers are considered in the studies, namely ?1 and ?2. The VRS has to sign contracts with the two providers in advance. Moreover, the contract workers could be trained to enhance the skill performing the job.

providers guarantee 120 seconds of the maximum processing time to complete a HIT. Let the maximum number of contract workers which can be supplied by each provider be 1,000. The number of on-demand workers is assumed to be infinite in both providers. The same price of the contract option in ?1 and ?2 is $1.7 per man-hour. Note that all prices used in the parameter setting are based on an hourly wage in Thailand. It is assumed that the number of man-hours offered by a contract worker equals the amount of time of the deadline. Hence, the cost to hire a single contract worker (i.e., ???) is equal to 1.7?? .

Prices in the on-demand option vary. We use historical prices of Spot Instances in Amazon EC2 to simulate the probability distributions of the on-demand prices used in the studies. We first set the constant value equal to three as a base value. Then, the results of adding the base value to the Amazon EC2 spot prices of Linux m2.2xlarge (US East) in October 2010 and December 2010 are applied for the fluctuating on-demand prices in ?1 and ?2, respectively.

The probability distributions of on-demand prices in ?1 and ?2 are shown in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b), respectively.

To obtain the probability distribution of the scenario set (i.e., ?), we first let ?(C)? and ?  (N) ? be the sets of on-demand  prices in provider ? and the possible numbers of HITs of job ?, respectively. Then, ? can be defined through the Cartesian product as follows:  ? = ? ???  ? ???  ? (C) ? ? ?(N)? .

The joint distribution of all uncertainty parameters (i.e., ?) is shown in Fig. 3(d). Note that the total number of scenarios is 94,600.

Next, the optimization model in (7)-(10) with the param- eters defined in this section is implemented and solved by GAMS/CPLEX [15] to evaluate the HRPO.

C. Results  Table I: Number of contract workers and cost given different deadline.

Without a fixed deadline, 16,667 man-hours and 7,214 man-hours will be re- quired to handle the maximum number of HITs (i.e., 500,000 HITs) and the average number of HITs (i.e., 216,416 HITs), respectively. With a deadline, the HRPO yields the optimal number of man-hours under the uncertainties. Given a fixed deadline, the result of the solutions consisting of the number of contract workers hired from providers ?1 and ?2 (i.e., ?1 and ?2, respective) are shown in Table I. The shorter deadline results in greater number of contract workers and higher expected cost to be required for the job. For example, given a deadline which is shorter than three hours, the job can be accomplished by hiring 1,000 contract workers from each provider (which is the maximum number of contract workers supplied by the provider). The expected costs of deadlines being longer than two hours are converged, since the number of man-hours (about 8,967 man-hours) will be sufficient to complete all the HITs. In other words, the job can be finished within three hours while the expected cost can be minimized under the uncertainties of the number of HITs and on-demand prices.

Next, we compare the HRPO with the other models, namely non-subscription (NS), random-subscription (RS), and expected-value of uncertainty (EU). The NS model applies only the on-demand option. The RS model sets the number of workers randomly. The EU model is based on the Jensen?s inequality [16]. In this comparison, only provider ?1 and the 6-hour deadline are applied.

In Table. II, the number of contract workers and expected cost yielded by a given model is shown. The HRPO model yields the minimum cost given 833 contract workers. The RS model applies the different numbers of contract workers (i.e., 100, 250, 500, and 750). With such a random pattern,     Table II: Comparison among HRPO, non-subscription (NS), random subscription (RS), expected-value of uncertainty (EU).

For example, the solution given 750 contract workers is close to that of the HRPO model and acceptable, while the solution given 100 contract workers is poor. The EU model applies the maximum number of contract workers provided by the provider so the contract workers could be highly underutilized. The NS model yields the highest cost since the model dynamically applies only the expensive on- demand price. This NS model might be acceptable when the number of HITs is very small and known in advance.



VI. CONCLUSION  We have proposed the Human-Intelligence-as-a-Service (HIaaS) to be the cloud computing service utilizing human intelligence in a crowdsourcing marketplace for processing big data jobs. A big data job can be split to a number of tasks which can be processed by human workers in a parallel fashion. The software components have been recommended to be the basic building blocks of a HIaaS platform provided by a HIaaS provider. We have also shown that the on- demand and contract workers should be offered by HIaaS providers. A HIaaS customer can a priori reserve the number of contract workers to hedge against the risks of fluctuating prices and unavailability of on-demand workers.

In the paper, we have proposed the the HRPO model based on stochastic programming primarily derived from the HIaaS customer?s perspective for minimizing the cost to provision workers from HIaaS providers for big data processing. We have performed the numerical studies to evaluate the model.

The video rating system handling a large number of video clips has been analyzed in the studies. The results show that the model can efficiently reduce the cost to provision workers while the uncertainties are taken into account and the job deadline is met. For a HIaaS provider, the proposed HIaaS model can be applied to implement a crowdsourcing marketplace for big data processing. For a HIaaS consumer, our HRPO model can be applied to reduce the cost to provision workers under the uncertainties.

For the future work, the detail of the HIaaS implementa- tion (i.e., the eight software components in Fig. 1) will be discussed. An efficient scheduling policy for the scheduler  component specifically designed for a crowdsourcing envi- ronment will be proposed. An efficient recruitment method for the HIaaS model will be explored. Techniques to improve workers? performance and validate the accuracy of results in crowdsourcing will be investigated. The HRPO model will be improved to fit an actual crowdsourcing environment.

For example, the workers? performance degradation will be taken into account. The dependency of tasks (e.g., a workflow of tasks) will be considered. The computational complexity of the HRPO model will be extensively studied.
