I. INTRODUCTION Subsequences partition based on time window is a  basic step of time series data mining (e.g. forecasting, decision tree mining, association rules mining), and the partition results directly affect the mining result[1]. Up to now, methods for subsequences partition are mainly focusing on dividing subsequences from the time series by the same width time window.

In our paper, a new approach that divides the time series with different width time window is put forward.

Firstly, the limitation of subsequence partition with the same width time window is analyzed. And several partition algorithms of time series are introduced. Then, an improved event series generation algorithm is proposed and a subsequence partition algorithm by different width time window is put forward base on the event series generated. Also, the proposed algorithm is tested by the data from Shanghai Stock Market.



II. LIMITATION OF SUBSEQUENCES PARTITION BY THE SAME WIDTH TIME WINDOW  Suppose ),,,( 21 Nxxxs =  is a time series and subsequence ),,,( 11 ?++= wiiii xxxs  is acquired by dividing s  by the same width time window with length w . Do the single-step slippage on s from the start point to end point, so we can get a series of subsequences  121 ,,, +?wNsss  all with the width w , which are noted as: }1,2,1|{),( +?== wNiswsw i       (1)  Fig.1 shows that the subsequence series A and series B have a high similarity. However, it is impossible to get A and B at the same time according to traditional methods of subsequences partition by the same width time window,  because the width of the time widow of A is 6 while that of B is 5.

After the above analysis, we can see the limitations of subsequences partition by the same width time window are: (1) There is a great deal of duplicated information which will result in redundancy, or if the subsequences are not duplicated, they may miss crucial information points; (2) it is not allowed to contract the shape of subsequences series on the time axis.



III. SEGMENTATION ALGORITHMS OF TIME SERIES  To describe the character model of the time series is the first thing to be solved when executing time series data mining and the event points selection is an important method for such description. The result of event points selection will decide the shape of characters mode of the time series, and finally affect the data mining results[1, 2].

All partition algorithms need a measure method to identify how to do the partition calculation. Up to now, three measure methods base on fitting errors are mainly used: accumulative residual AE , mean residual ME and maximum residual DE , respectively[2].

There are mainly three kinds of methods for partition of time series base on errors: (1) Sliding Window method: to increase the segments till the accumulative residual reaches the preset threshold[3-5]; (2) Top-Down method: to repeat the dichotomy of the time series till the fitting error reaches the preset threshold[6-7]; (3) Bottom-Up method: Beginning at the maximum segment (it is also the highest fitting one), to combine the neighbored segments one by one till the fitting error reaches the preset threshold[8-9].

DOI 10.1109/IC4E.2010.66     Among them, the Sliding Window method is the simplest, most direct, and its computation complexity is least as O(Ln) , where n is the length of the series, and L is the average distance of the adjacent event points. However, the correctness of this method is low, because it only cares about the minimum error of local parts of the time series, but neglects the changing characters of the global ones.

The Top-Down method pays attention to the global partition errors of the series, so it has a better partition result than the Sliding Window method. However, its computation complexity is higher as )( 2KnO , where k is the partition number, LnK /= . Besides, it needs more parameters including the global partition error threshold, the expected partition number and the error threshold of each part. The Bottom-Up method focuses not only on the fitting error after subsequences combination, but also on the partition characters by selecting the minimum combination cost, so it has a better partition performance than the pervious method. What more, it needs a less computation complexity as )(LnO . However, this method also bases on the least squares algorithm which is time consuming, and it needs to preset the error threshold of combination, expected event point number after combination and so on.

The algorithms mentioned above all use the error threshold to deal with the time series. However, as the time series have different linearity, the partition result may not be satisfied according to the time trend. Here are two main limitations: (1) partition algorithms based on the accumulative residual can not effectively identify the large trend change of a short time; (2) partition algorithms based on the mean errors may be weak to identify the inflection point of a time series which have been fitted well for a long time.



IV. SUBSEQUENCES PARTITION BY DIFFERENT WIDTH TIME WINDOW  A. Improved Event Series Generation Algorithm Definition: event series is a series, which can  approximate represents the original time series, by selecting the crucial position points of the time series.

Njgggs Nj ??= 1),,,,,( 1 represents a time series, where N is the length of s , ),( jj yjg = , jy  is the observation value of the series at time j . 's  represents a event series, and MiGGGss Mi ??=? 1),,,,,( 1  ' , where iG  is the i th crucial point of the event series  's and the j th point of the time series s , and it is described as ),( ji yjG = . Define sGi .  and vGi .  as the time of the event series corresponding to the time series and the observation value of the time series, meaning  jsGi =. , ji yvG =. .

Till now, all of the partition algorithms have their own shortages in presenting the trend of the time series. Among them, the Bottom-Up method performs best according to the literatures, so in our paper, the improved Bottom-Up partition method is proposed. The procedure is as follows:  Step 1: Time series are firstly reduced by triangle reduction method. The points after reduction are the candidates of the event series. ),( '' ii yx  represents the i th point of the time series , where Ni ??1 . iy is the observation value of v. The adjacent three points can form a triangle as shown in Fig.2. If they satisfy formula (2), where ),( jiDist  is used to measure the Euclidean distance between i and j , and 1?  is the reduction threshold, then i  is not the crucial point and should be reduced.

Firstly, select the event points from the set of candidates, and link them on by on, so to get segments. Secondly, combine the segments, calculate each maximum error of segments after combination, and select the minimum error among them. If such value is less than 2? , then reduce the middle point of the segments, repeat the above process till the minimum error is larger than 2? . Finally, the left points are the event points.

Figures below show the process of event series generation. Fig.3 is the original time series. Firstly, the candidate set of event series are acquired by the triangle reduction method as shown in Fig.4. Secondly, the improved Bottom-Up method is adopted and then the event series are generated, which is shown as Fig.5.

B. Subsequences generation To partition the event series 's  by subsequences  generation method, we can get the subsequence of time series by the different width time window, represented by collection ''s .

The subsequences partition method is described as  follows: Input: the time series s , the event series 's Output: the subsequences ''s (1) Set 0=v ; (2) If Mv =+1 then go to end; else 1+= vv ?  vi = ? vi SG ? ? 1. =nuSv ? 1+= ii ; (3) If Mi =  then vi SG ? , 1.. += nuSnuS vv ,go to  end; else if 1??

V. Example Take 241 data points of Shanghai Stock Market in  May 19th, 2006 as the original time series. Firstly, the improved event series generation algorithm was used to acquire event series from the time series. Secondly, the subsequences generation algorithm was adopted based on the partition method with different width time window.

Finally, the 24 crucial points of event series were acquired, as shown in Fig.6.

Set the width of the different time window w  to 40, and use the single-step slipping method to divide the time series. 21 subsequences can be generated, which is far less than the 211 subsequences acquired by traditional partition method. Parts of the subsequences are shown in Table 1.

VI. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, an improved event series generation  algorithm is proposed and a subsequence partition algorithm with different width time window base on the  proposed method is put forward. The advantages of the above method are:  (1) It can avoid information duplication between subsequences generated by the same time series partition;  (2) The subsequences generated by single-step slipping method won?t miss key information points;  (3) It is allowed to contract the shape of subsequences since the lengths of the series are different.

However, there are still some shortages with the proposed method:  (1) The compute complexity of the proposed method is higher than traditional method;  (2) The method only fits for high-dimensional time series, while not for low-dimensional ones;     (3) The subsequences generated by the proposed method are with different length. Till now, there are no mature algorithms for distance measurement of subsequences with different length.
