I. INTRODUCTION  With the maturity of database technology and application of universal, the amount of data accumulated with an exponential rate of rapid growth in human being.

On the 21st century, when the volume of data grow extremely, if there is no effective way to extract useful information and knowledge, people will feel as helpless as to the needle in the haystack on face the ocean of information.

It is estimated that a large enterprise database data, only 7% is well applied. In this way, as opposed to "data glut" and the "information explosion", people also felt that the "information poor" (Information poor).

Enterprises attach importance to Logistics as a third source of increasing profits, and the enormous data stream based on information logistics network system, so difficult for enterprises make accurate and efficient decision-making based on these data.

Therefore, how to discover the useful data?fresh knowledge and information in order to help decision makers quickly and accurately make decisions from the data ocean, This gives theorists and practitioners new questions.

SJEP algorithm which based on the logistics information platform can help decision makers quickly and accurately decisions to achieve the control of the logistics process.



II. CLASSIFICATION OF DATA MINING ALGORITHMS  Data mining association rules is one of the most active research methodologies in 1993, proposed by Agrawal etc.

It was originally put forward for the market basket  analysis, and its purpose is to discover different commodities trading database, the link between the rules, these rules which can be used to guide the business to arrange purchase inventory and shelf design.

Association rule mining problem find the right course of association rules through a user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence level on given a transaction database D. In general, association rule mining problem can be divided into discovered frequent item sets and generate association rules on two issues.

Frequent item sets are the focus of association rules algorithms in recent years, its research is based on Agrawal who created item sets lattice space theory.

As for generating association rules in terms of major items in each frequent focus on them, one by one matching rules and conduct Confidence ? min Confidence testing is necessary, so this part of the work is relatively more mature.

In 1994, Agrawal proposed Apriori association rules algorithm, since then Apriori algorithm served as the classic for association rules algorithm referenced.

Apriori algorithm idea used a method known as step by step in the iterative search through the growing number of frequent item sets of elements of the project to the gradual completion discovered, that means the k item set for the exploration (k + l) set.

First of all, to identify a set of frequent sets of 1, the set  denoted in 1L , for 1L  sets to find frequent collection of  2L , and 2L  used to find 3L , and so continue until it  can not find frequent k item sets in KL .

DOI 10.1109/ICIC.2010.29    DOI 10.1109/ICIC.2010.29       Recycling process created in the first set of k candidate  item set is kC , and then generated by scanning the  database and test the degree of support generated k  frequent item sets KL , every KL  needed to find to scan  a database once again.

For the existence of a large number of frequent  patterns, long patterns, or the minimum support threshold is small, such Apriori algorithm will spend a large number of overhead to deal with an extraordinary candidate item set.

Since each generates a candidate item set, we must scan the database to determine its degree of support.

Therefore, a lot of waiting set of options for the database need to continue to access the database through pattern matching to calculate the degree of support item sets requires a lot of I/O overhead. The above considerations determine the efficiency of Apriori algorithm not too high.

On the 2000,Ramamo hanarao and Dong bring forward a jump Emerging Patterns (JEP) which contains a very important feature of powerful classification ability on analysis of the shortcomings based Apriori algorithm.

It identifies each data set (or class) the unique characteristics revealed in the jumping mode, JEP is defined as an item set, its support for a data set to 0, in another data set for non 0 degree of support a growth rate of ?.

By gathering all of the JEP, it can generate strong classification ability. In some large data sets for the classification of the number of JEP is usually large, the naive algorithm is used to tap all of the JEP and calculation of their collective effect is a very time-consuming.

Therefore, JEP Classifier algorithms mine the border JEP based on an algorithm. In addition, the rep will also help select those who are most expressive of the JEP.

On Comparison with Classification algorithm published and compared, JEP Classifiers really can achieve higher prediction accuracy.



III. SJEP ALGORITHM THEORY  A  SJEP Classification Algorithm  Through the study mention earlier, algorithms are usually continued several hours based on the classification of JEP stages of learning, one of the reasons is that a lot of unnecessary JEP is excavated.

The SJEP (that is the most effective jump Emerging Patterns) is a recently proposed by a special kind of JEP.

Compared to the existing classification based on JEP, using only SJEP classifications used in the establishment of JEP is a small number, it can not only receive the same or higher prediction accuracy, but also completed the  learning phase in a very short period of time (usually several seconds ).

In addition, the average prediction accuracy is also better than the CBA and C4.5 classification algorithms such as.

Because SJEP is a special JEP, so the algorithm can directly use the existing excavated all of the JEP, and then choose the SJEP.

For SJEP features, inspired by the FP growth algorithm, this article uses an efficient algorithm for direct mining SJEP all the items in the training data set of information stored in the expansion of compressed tree structure, and then use models to segment the growth of our mining SJEP.

B  SJEP algorithm structure  Definition: Assumptions 1C  and 2C  are two  different classes of data musters?Pre-specified minimum  support threshold min-sup> 0?From 1C  to 2C  of the  most effective jump Emerging Patterns (SJEP), recorded  as SJEP ( 1C , 2C ).

Set up an item set X meet the following two conditions: ? 1 ?  supmin)X(supp0)(supp C21 ??= andXC ?? 2 ?any subset of X, does not meet the conditions for 1.

Example: The following table simplifies the training  data set, it contains two classes 1C and 2C . (See Figure  ?).

Figure?: The training data sets  1C  2C  {1?3?4?5} {1} {2?5} {2?3?4?5}  {1?2?3} {2?3?5} {1?4} {4?5}  In this case a total of 10 JEP, where are(l, 5), (2,4), (3,4), (2,3,4), (3,4,5), (l, 3,5) , (1,4,5), (2,4,5) and (l, 3,4) supports Class 1, (1,2) support class 2.

Suppose the minimum thresholds of support for the l%, according to SJEP definition: (2,3,4), (3,4,5), (1,3,5), (1,4,5), (2,4,5) and (1,3,4) are not necessary?Because (1,5) is (1,3,5) and (l, 4,5) subset ? (2,4) is (2,3,4) and (2,4,5) subset, (3,4) is (2,3,4), (3,4,5) and (l, 3,4) subset.

So SJEP includes only the (1,5), (2,4) and (3,4), which is supports Class 1, (1,2) support class 2, a total of four SJEP.

Obvious, SJEP contains fewer JEP, and their classification is sufficient.

It is easy to see from the previous cases, SJEP is a special JEP, at least the training data set covering a number of instances, and contains fewer items (attributes).



IV. ARCHITECTURE OF LOGISTICS INFORMATION PLATFORM  Logistics Information Platform is the economic region in a certain context, links to logistics clients (manufacturing, commercial and wholesale enterprises, etc.), logistics companies (3PL, transportation, storage, etc.) and logistics-related sectors (transport, quality inspection, customs, taxation industrial and commercial, maritime, banking, etc.) socialization, open, Internet-based public information system.

The construction of modern logistics information platform is: to achieve highly efficient logistics services through the creation of a unified logistics information platform, breaking departmental separatism and fragmentation and establish a collaborative working mechanism; integration of logistics information platform of existing information resources.

Logistics Information Platform design requirements are mainly embodied in compatibility, efficiency, accuracy, effectiveness, safety and stability, and so on.

According to the function and organization of different data models on Common information platform, information platform should be composed of the following subsystems:  Data management subsystem: There are two main modules, one is the internal system of data extraction; the other is related to the data on external docking (e.g., traffic simulation subsystem);  Intelligent distribution management subsystem: The system is primarily support the vehicle's program scheduling and tracking through the GIS / GPS data organization reference model, the main data is the traffic flow background data;  Logistics Operation Management Subsystem: This system is support cargo tracking and tracing service mainly through the linear reference model data organization; the main data are cargo tracking information and warehouse management information;  Online transaction management subsystem: used to support (transport market trading, warehousing business transactions, etc.) various types of enterprises in the core functionality of the League of market transactions standardized management, and provide of credit certification functions;  Comprehensive information dissemination subsystems: publishing a number of sharing information, the provision of logistics information to the public services (such as national trade regulations, international trade information website links, etc), support the inter-departmental coordination mechanism established; Macro-decision support subsystem: mainly macro-management of  government departments in decision-making support services.

Platform Maintenance Management Subsystem: The main is the routine operation and maintenance management and building security authentication system.

Specific system architecture are showed in Figure ?.



V. SJEP ALGORITHM SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION  According to logistics information platform which share information to meet the needs of data sharing organizational model, a variety of different models have different basic operational requirements, the main data query and data manipulation is the performance of public information.

For Figure ?, the five sub-systems, how to efficiently perform data query and the performance of public information through the SJEP-tree structure of data compression and storage of the training focused on all the items of information is the main problem.

Its structure somewhat similar to the FP-tree structure, different is that: (1) on count of field, it is instances of the categories need to modify the corresponding count field in SJEP-tree; (2) on pointer field, SJEP tree has two pointers, namely, horizon link and vertical link. It allows us to traverse from the bottom up SJEP tree, and can easily access SJEP tree items that have the same name of the node.

On generated SJEP-tree, you need to traversal SJEP tree top-down (that is, traversing from the root to a leaf node) scan data set D at the same time, the training data set for each item inserted into the tree; in Mining SJEP, traverse SJEP tree only from bottom-up.

Therefore, SJEP tree do not have bi-directional traversal.

so, in this algorithm horizon link and vertical link has two purposes: Generated SJEP-tree in the process of  The upper data request module called  Intelligent D istribution  M anagem  entSubsystem  Logistics O peration  M anagem  entSubsystem  O nline transaction  m anagem  entsubsystem  C om  prehensive inform ation  dissem ination  subsystem s  M acro-decision  support  subsystem  Platform Maintenance Management Subsystem  The lower data request module called  Figure? Information Platform design       pointing with the left-most child vertical link, Point with horizon link next sibling node; In the SJEP-tree structure, it has a good post-construction, Changes vertical link, to point to parents nodes, modify horizon link, to point to the next node in the node in the chain. This approach can save half of the pointer.

In the excavation SJEP algorithm, Suffix sub-tree is also an important concept, the use of the premise of horizon link and vertical link is from a node in the starting chain of each node, the bottom-up search SJEP-tree, through the following steps to achieve:  Initializes p to point a node in the chain the first node; i=1; While (p<>NULL) {PST (a).branch[i]=p->vertical_link; branch_count1=p->count1; branch_count2=p->count2; PST (a).base_count1 [i] =branch_count1; / / Record in order to (a) for each sub-path of the suffix  on the class C1 of the basic frequency count; PST (a).base_count2 [i] =branch_count2; / / Record in order to (a) for each sub-path of the suffix  on the class C2 of the basic frequency count; q=p->vertical_link; While (q<>root) { PST (a).count1 [q] =PST(a).count1[q]+branch_count1; / / Record PST (a) has an item name of the node q on  the class C1 and the frequency counts; PST (a).count2 [q] =PST (a).count2 [q]  +branch_count2 / / Record PST (a) has an item name, q q=q->vertical_link; } p=p->horizonl_link; i++;} Mining the effective SJEP from SJEP-tree, to achieve  the Call Mine_SJEP (T), T recorded as SJEP-tree, the Mine_SJEP process only checks whether each item in JEP. If it is JEP, then it must be a SJEP, do not need to continue to consider any such as a suffix pattern. If it is not a JEP, then generates an order to sub-tree for the suffix, and then even longer pattern completed by the mining process. Process insert_jep (pattern, SJEP_List) mode can inserted pattern into the SJEP_List. SJEP_List  formed by the two lists, were recorded from class 1C  to  class 2C  and the SJEP from class 2C  to class  SJEP 1C .

By construction change pointers finished by SJEP-tree method, saving half of the pointer; it also tap the mode through the introduction of the prefix sub-tree methods, it?s not generate the conditions for sub-tree to overcome the FP-growth algorithm in mining mode needs delivery go to generate a large number of shortcomings in terms of sub-tree, which greatly improved the efficiency of spatial and temporal pattern mining.



VI.  CONCLUSION  The establishment of logistics information platform is the new needs of modern logistics development, this paper proposed the algorithm based on SJEP Logistics Data Association Rules Mining based on the traditional data mining methods, Researched on the Logistics Information System are the perspective of Classification algorithms, and this method improved the efficiency of the logistics information platform.
