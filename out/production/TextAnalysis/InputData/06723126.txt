I. INTRODUCTION  In recent years, with the advancement of earth observa- tion technologies and prevalence of data-intensive geospa- tial applications such as WebGIS and Internet of Things (IoT)[1] applications, a large number of sensors have been deployed to measure physical properties of the real world, which has generated big spatio-temporal sensor data. The captured spatio-temporal data are significant for driving intelligence analysis and decision support in various appli- cation scenarios, such as monitoring temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide density and other environmental measure- ments to analyse global climate change. Typical spatio- temporal sensor data are high-dimensional, which contains spatial extent, time series and multiple measurement at- tributes. More specifically, the sensor data with space-time characteristics could be represented as record structure with spatial-temporal information and attributes, i.e., <ID, Spatial Location, Timestamp, Attr_1, Attr_2, ? ? ? , Attr_n>.

Spatio-temporal index method is one of the most sig- nificant issues for accelerating data retrieval and query efficiency. Both academic and industrial communities have presented different index methods for efficiently pruning irrelevant data while processing queries. The state-of-the-art  index methods are based on single-node Spatial Database Management System (SDBMS) [2]. They perform well while processing small datasets. However, they have been posed on grand challenges while answering queries from large collections of spatio-temporal sensor data. First of all, they are inefficient due to poor scalability and strict transac- tional semantics of underlying SDBMS. Furthermore, most of them are designed for centralized computing environment rather than distributed cluster, with which the retrieval and query operations are executed serially. Besides, their limited storage and computing capabilities cannot support intensive access and query requests from numerous concurrent users.

Driven by the above deficiencies, in this paper, we propose a distributed composite spatio-temporal index scheme called VegaIndexer for efficiently processing queries over big sensor data. The scheme takes advantage of the emerging spatial cloud computing[3] paradigm to provide a promising solution for accelerating retrieval and query efficiency. The design details of VegaIndexer are presented as follows.

Firstly, we present a distributed indexing architecture for spatio-temporal data on top of cloud platform which consists of global index and local index. The global index is used to determine data block location, while the local index is used to find feature object within a block. Secondly, we propose Multi-version Distributed enhanced R+ (MDR+) tree algorithm for accelerating spatio-temporal data retrieval and query efficiency. MDR+ index could improve random access efficiency and support various query types, which includes spatial selection, temporal and attribute queries.

In practical geospatial applications, the MDR+ indices are resident in distributed memory cache to avoid disk I/O la- tency, which guarantees real-time response to the concurrent users. Thirdly, we design a MapReduce-based parallel pro- cessing approach of batch construction indices for big spatio- temporal sensor data. In addition, we implement VegaIndexer middleware on top of the leading Hadoop cloud platfor- m [4] and NoSQL database (i.e.,HBase)[5]. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate VegaIndexer and its SDBMS competitors(i.e., PostGIS and Oracle Spatial) with real geospatial application workloads. The results show that VegaIndexer outperforms its comparisons, e.g., its average index construction efficiency is about 4?6 times better and its selection query performance is about 2.2 ? 4.3 times     better than that of SDBMS. Moreover, VegaIndexer has achieved super linear acceleration, e.g., its average speedup efficiency is improved by about 68.5%? 116.3% while the number of cluster nodes increasing from 2 to 8. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the details of VegaIndexer. Section III describes the performance evaluation. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section IV.



II. METHODOLOGY  A. Architecture of VegaIndexer  To meet the intensive accesses and retrieval requirements of geospatial applications, we design hierarchical architecture for VegaIndexer with multiple layers. Fig.1 shows the VegaIndexer architecture. The bottom layer is Hadoop cloud platform, which is deployed on a scale-out cluster composed of commodity servers. Hadoop consists of two key components: Hadoop Distributed File System [6] and MapReduce [7], both of them are master-slave architecture, i.e., one master node controls several slave nodes. The HDFS depends on the local file systems (e.g., Linux ext families) and the HDFS block files are stored on local disk. The MapReduce daemons are deployed on the same physical cluster as HDFS, and the master node is assigned as coordinator (JobTracker) and other nodes as worker nodes (TaskTracker). The NoSQL database is heavily depended on the storage and computing capabilities of underlying Hadoop platform. At this layer, we select HBase as the representative NoSQL database for its good scalability and high availability. HBase is a column-oriented key-value store, and each logical table consists of multiple column families. The data objects are physically organized in Column Family (CF), and each CF usually contains several columns. VegaIndexer could conveniently add new column family or column into an existing HBase table. The raw sensor data files are stored on Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for long-term preservation, while the extracted data from spatial and temporal fields are represented as <KeyID, CF:Spatial, CF:Timestamp, CF_attr_v_1, CF_attr_v_2, ? ? ? , CF_attr_v_n> pairs on HBase tables and each column family represents a property such as temperature, pollutant concentration.

The third and fourth layers are the kernel of VegaIndexer.

The third layer is the online spatio-temporal sensor data index Generator and Responsor. The Generator is used to create, update and reorganize index periodically, while the Responser receives the client requests for index data access.

We design disk-based MDR+ tree index and keyword B- tree index based on HBase for high throughput access and near real-time data retrieval. The index operation algorithms such as creation, insert, update and delete are embedded into Generator and Responsor. The Generator encapsulates MapReduce-based bulk-loading operator for batch construc- tion of spatio-temporal index. The indices are constructed in parallel by cluster nodes with MapReduce after loading the sensor data into HBase tables. The Responsor is a daemon which used to receive the client request of data retrieval.

When clients request for data, Responsor firstly parses the request parameters and resolves the spatial extent and time interval. Then Responsor determines the effective MDR+  trees that intersect with the MBR and time interval, and sends instruction messages to worker nodes that maintain the candidate MDR+ trees. These worker nodes execute the instructions in parallel and compute respective intermediate results. Finally, the master node collects the results from TaskTrackers and returns final result to clients.

According to the access patterns of real applications, the index tree will be frequently retrieved for pruning the unqualified data objects and obtaining the candidate objects, so the index retrieval efficiency is critical for supporting concurrent real-time accesses. Moreover, once the data with- in a specific region and time interval are requested, the geographically adjacent data will probably be accessed in the near future. Thus, a distributed buffer manager termed vCache is designed for MDR+ index and hot spot sensor data to guarantee real-time access. Each node allocates a configurable memory pool, and vCache composes a bigger distributed caching pool by gathering small pools with consistent hashing protocol. E.g., there are 8 nodes and each node allocates 1 GB, the vCache capacity is 8 GB in size.

vCache could configure variable memory size in terms of data volume. In the practical applications, all of the index data are persistent in vCache, but only parts of the spatio- temporal data are pre-fetched into vCache according to access frequency. The top layer is vTunnel, which is served as the sensor data transfer tunnel and collector. vTunnel maintains several real-time fist in first out (FIFO) queues, and each queue receives the sensor data stream from sink node of sensor network. Assume that the queue capacity is Qv and the number of queues is nv, the data stream will be flushed into VegaIndexer periodically while the accumulated data have reached to threshold size (i.e., nvQv).

B. Multi-version Distributed enhanced R+  VegaIndexer could bridges the gap between geospatial applications and cloud platform. As mentioned above, since     the Hadoop platform is master-slave architecture, our index scheme includes global index and local index. The global index is used to find the data blocks and the sensor data objects are determined by traversing local index tree. In this paper, the global index and local index are designed from scratch. More specifically, we revise the Quadtree index which serves as the global index, and Multi-version Distributed enhanced R+ tree is designed as the local index.

The MDR+ designed as two-tiered distributed structure, which is inspired from Revised R? tree (RR?)[8] and consistent hashing policy. The sensor data objects are split by fixed time intervals, and there is a temporal RR? tree for respective time intervals. The intermediate node of MDR+  index tree contains Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) of spatial location and time interval of its children nodes.

The real data objects are stored in the data block, and the leaf nodes of MDR+ are pointed to the objects. The sensor data objects are evenly distributed across cluster data nodes according to their weighted factor ?, where ? is computed by spatial extent (e.g., MBR area) and consistent hash value of object ID, i.e., ? = combine(MBR,HashobjID).

As shown in Fig.2, the objects are organized into 3 groups at a given time interval [ts, te] in terms of their MBR.

The root and non-leaf nodes are maintained by the Master and resident in vCache, while the leaf nodes are stored on 3 slave nodes. With the continuously growth of spatio- temporal sensor data, the index data volume will certainly increase as well. The spatial and temporal information are extracted as <ID, location> and <ID, time_interval> from data records respectively. Data objects are grouped and evenly distributed across cluster nodes, and each slave node maintains data within a specific spatial extent and time interval. Besides, the insert, creation, update and delete tasks are conducted in parallel by bulk-loading operator with Mapper and Reducer daemons.

C. VegaIndexer Implementation  We have implemented VegaIndexer middleware on top of Hadoop cloud platform. As show in Fig.3, the global index tree is maintained by Master Node of Hadoop cluster, while the local indices are persistent on Slave Nodes. The intermediate nodes of global tree represent the subregions of geographical layer, which is partitioned with spatial extent measurements. Each intermediate subregion should  be subdivided into four quadrants, i.e., the non-leaf node has four child nodes. The leaf node of global index tree is pointed to the root node of local MDR+ index tree. The local index items (entries) are loaded into memory cache pools of slave nodes with VegaIndexer daemons booting up.

In addition, the global index tree is preserved as metadata image, and the index data are kept in memory of master node to improve index traversal and pruning efficiency.

III. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION The experiments are conducted on a cluster composed  of 8 commodity servers(1 master and 7 slaves), and each node has two quad-core Intel CPU 2.13GHZ, 4GB DDR3 RAM, 15000r/min SAS 300GB hard disk. All nodes have identical CentOS 5.5 server edition, JDK-1.6.0_35, PostGIS- 2.0, Oracle Spatial 11gR2, Hadoop-1.1, HBase-0.94. The spatio-temporal sensor dataset size is about 875.3GB. The test data are divided into 35 time intervals, and each slave node is maintaining 5 intervals.

The VegaIndexer is compared with PostGIS and Oracle Spatial by two experiments. As shown in Fig.4, the VegaIn- dexer performs best while batch building index for datasets in different size. Its execution time is about 4 ? 6 times less than that of comparisons, and obviously it performs better with larger dataset. Moreover, we conduct spatio- temporal selection query operation to evaluate the three schemes. Fig.5 shows the query performance of comparisons with different number of concurrent queries, and the query efficiency of VegaIndexer is 2.2 ? 4.3 times better than that of comparisons while the concurrent requests increased from 100 to 600. In addition, we evaluate the speedup of VegaIndexer with bulk-loading operations. During this test, VegaIndexer batch building indices for different datasets and     then loading them into vCache for further retrieval. Let ? de- note the speedup efficiency, and ?, n denote the acceleration speedup and number of cluster nodes, where ? is computed by ?n , i.e., ? =  ? n . As shown in Fig.6, VegaIndexer achieves  super linear acceleration, and its average speedup efficiency is improved by 68.5%?116.3% (i.e., ? ? [68.5%?116.3%]) with n increasing from 2 to 8.
