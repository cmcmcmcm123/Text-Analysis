High effect shelves which can be defined as shelves with fitting height, location etc, can play higher promotion effect on demand. Apparently, shelves with high effect are important and sparse resource of retail stores since a great quantity of products compete the limited shelf space for effectively display. It has acknowledged that displayed inventory on shelf space has an effect on sales for many retail products [1].

Mantrala revealed that a good assortment of displayed items can increase customers? perception of shopping convenience and improve their loyalty [2]. In particular, Wong pointed out that displayed products assortment should be adjusted to account for shifting consumer profile and lifestyle trend [3]. Larson etc called the displayed inventory which is carried to stimulate demand ?psychic stock? and suggested ?full-shelf merchandising? policy [4]. Dreze etc made a series of field experiments and found that location of the product within a display, especially the level of shelf on which the product is displayed in case of multi-level shelf, has different effect on sales[5].

Because sales of displayed inventory can be increased by attracting the consumer?s attention and encouraging consumers to have additional purchase opportunities, product assortment for shelf space has been considered as an important decision to retailers. The product assortment problem is concerned with the optimum use of shelves to provide a complete assortment of products meeting the customer?s needs, or say, the problem is to determine the variety of products to be displayed on the shelves that have the greatest value to customers so as to maximize retailer?s profit.

Due to the space limitation of high effect shelf, retailers can only display few products available from suppliers.

Therefore, high effect shelf is an import resource for gaining profit. For making the best of shelf space, sometimes, retailers need to abandon some low-profit items in high effect shelf and transfer these shelves to high-profit items. What items should be discarded is a  difficult decision problem. The difficulty is that the profit of one item not only comes from its own sales, but also from its influence on the sales of other items, i.e., the "cross demand effect". Another challenge to the product assortment problem is that customer?s demands are ever-changing. The demand intensity for product would change with time. This dynamic nature of demand makes both the direct profit and indirect profit from cross demand effect of a product change with time.

Thus, the product assortment should be dynamically changed with time so as to make the shelf allocation respond the changing demand in dynamic market.

The increase of electronic data gathering devices, such as point-of-sale technologies, has made it easier for retailers to collect data, and some knowledge about customer behavior can be learned from these data.

Furthermore, the retailer can roughly estimate customer?s demand before the sale begins through analyzing historical data and fine-tune this estimation by using real time sales data. Through estimating customers? demand intensity for various products and analyzing their purchasing pattern, retailer can observe a product assortment?s marketing effect in a simulated setting for intending sale horizon. In this paper, a transaction simulation approach is presented, and a dynamic product assortment algorithm is developed through analyzing simulated transaction data.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: related researches are reviewed in next part of this section. Section 2 gives the problem definition. The transaction simulation approach is depicted in Section 3.

Section 4 describes how to estimate direct and indirect profit with simulated data. Then, in Section 5, a genetic algorithm for dynamic product assortment is introduced.

Experiments results are addressed in section 6. This paper ends with concluding remarks in Section 7.

1.1 Related researches  Product assortment problem of high effect shelf management can be defined as the process to select products in business for display in high effect shelf       space. The measurement of demand effects which has been widely used to estimate the relationship between sales and allocated space, is the main challenge for this problem. Demand effects can be divided into two types: direct demand effect and cross-demand effect. Direct demand effect is used to measure the effect on demand by changing the display space for product, and the cross-demand effect of a target product is measured to estimate the effect on demand of other products by changing the display space for this product.

Anderson and Amato formulated the product assortment optimization model as a knapsack problem, in which only the direct demand effect was considered [6].

Hansen and Heinsbroek also estimated the direct demand effects in their mathematical programming [7].

Corstjens and Doyle developed a generalized geometric programming model with both the direct effects and cross effects of demand [8]. Zufryden presented dynamic programming approach to solve the model of Corstjens and Doyle, in which the integer solutions can be provided through allowing the consideration of general objective function requirements [9]. Cross demand effect was considered in Borin?s optimization model, and simulated annealing algorithm was suggested as a solution methodology [10]. Urban integrated the inventory control model with the product assortment model [11]. A type of multi-constraint knapsack model for the shelf space allocation, developed by Yang, take display space and shelf location into consideration [12]. Hark presented a genetic algorithm to optimize shelf space design and item allocation [13].

However, high cost of experiment is needed to measure direct demand effect and cross demand effect in above-mentioned model. To overcome this drawback, some data mining-based approaches were proposed.

Brijs proposed a model celled PROFSET to solve the product assortment problem in convenience stores, in which cross demand effect can be measured by association rules [14]. Wang draw an analogy between this cross demand effect and the mutual reinforcement of hub/authority web pages and applies the ?hub-authority? profit ranking approach to solve the maximal profit item-selection problem [15]. Wong proposed a novel approach with consideration of the loss rule?a rule similar to the association rule?to model the cross demand effect [16].

2. PROBLEM DEFINITION  Given a items set I with n different items, I1, I2, ?, In, let I={I1, I2, ??, In}. We supposed that only m items can be displayed in high effect shelf space for a selling horizon. Before the sale begins, the seller conducts market researches such as market surveys or historical data analysis, to forecast the customer arrival number N and each product?s sale quantity iQ . The decision horizon can be separated into T discrete epochs to make each epoch short enough that within each epoch there is almost one customer arrival. Thus, the arrival rate of  each epoch can be calculated by: T N=? . The  probability that an arrival customer would purchase the  i-th product is: T Qi  i =? . Let vector ?=(?1, ?2??n)  denote the estimated purchasing probabilities for all items in set I.

We refer to the profit of an item coming from its own sales as direct profit, the profit coming from "cross demand effect" as indirect profit. As defined by Brijs etc [14, 15, 16], the cross demand effect can be measured by association rules.

Because customers? purchasing patterns are relatively steady, an item?s direct profit and indirect profit mainly rest with demand intensity parameters:? and ?. We supposed that m different items should be selected for high effect shelf space. Let ID ?  be the set of selected items, and DIV ?=  be the set of reserved items. Let ),(, ??DDR  be the direct profit of D when demand parameters are ? and ?. Let ),(, ??VDR denote indirect profit of D due to cross demand effects on V. Then the total profit of D is given by:  ),(),(),( ,, ?????? VDDDD RRR +=       (1) Suppose that retailer determines to select m different items from set I for the sake of making the best of high effect shelf space. The problem researched in this paper is how to partition set I into two subsets D and V. The goal of partition is that profit from set D should be as high as possible.

3. TRANSACTION SIMULATION  Let X={x1, x2,?xk} denote an items set, where xi?I. let U denote a transaction set, card(U) denote the number of transactions in U, and card(X) denote the number of all the transactions that contain items set X,  s(X)= )( )(  Ucard Xcard  denote the frequent occurrence degree  of items set X. A frequent items set can be defined as follow: if there exist an items set X, and s(X)>?, then items set X is a frequent items set. Here ?(0<?<1) is a threshold value. Let x (x ?I) be an item in business,  apparently, s(x)= )( )(  Ucard xcard  is the frequent degree of  item x. If s(x) >?, we call x frequent item.

Assumption 1: High effect Shelf space should display items that are sufficient to attract customer. The frequent degree s(x) just reflects how much customers are interested by the item x. Thus only frequent item can be candidate for displaying in high effect shelf space.

According to assumption 1, we just need to simulate the transaction containing frequent item.

Definition 1: if X is a frequent items set and card(X)=k, then X is called k-frequent items set and denoted by  kX . If frequent item sets kX  and ikX +  satisfy:      kX ? ikX + , then ikX +  can be called super frequent item set of kX .

Apparently, any item x in frequent item set kX  is also a frequent item, and the set {x} can be called 1-frequent item set.

Definition 2: if a transaction contains frequent item set  kX , but not contains any super frequent item set of kX , then we call this transaction according with the  purchasing pattern. kX? . The kX?  is called k-pattern.

Let set ?  denote the set of all the super frequent item set of kX . The number of all the transactions that accord with kX?  can be calculated as follow:  ? ??  +  + ?=  1X  1)X()X()X?( k  kkk cardcardcard      (2)  Let an item xi?Xk. If a transaction contains item xi, then the conditional probability that this transaction accords with pattern Xk can be calculated as follow:  )( )X?()X?Pr(  i  k  i k  xcard cardx =             (3)  According to the generalized total probability formula, the probability that an arrival customer?s transaction pattern accords to kX? can be calculated by:  ? ?  ?= k  i Xx i  k i  k x )X?Pr()X?Pr( ?        (4)  Assumption 2: Purchasing patterns corresponding to customer behavior can be discovered in the transaction data set, and these patterns will remain unchanged in relatively short time horizon.

Assumption 3: A customer buys only one unit of a certain product in same transaction.

Frequent item set can be discovered in historical transaction data set, and according to assumption 2, its? frequent degree s(X) will remains steady.

Let t (t=1,2?T) denote the index of epoch in a decision horizon. Suppose that parameters ? and ? are known, a Monte Carlo-based transaction simulation algorithm is design as follow:  Monte Carlo-based Transaction Simulation Find out all frequent item set and frequent degree s(X) Let t=1 Do while t?T Simulate customer?s arrival by probability ? If there happen a customer arrival event then Work out occurrence probability of each pattern kX? Simulate purchase event by )X?Pr( k  End if t=t+1 End do   4. PROFIT ESTIMATION  Let TU  denote simulated transaction set within decision horizon T, iu  be the i-th transaction in TU .

Let A={A1, A2,? Am} denote the set of association rules discovered from TU . The j-th rule Aj can be  denoted by: Xi? Yi (si%) (ci%), where si% denotes the support degree of this rule, and ci% denotes the confidence degree. Let D be a decision, then V= I-D.

Definition 3: if rule Aj satisfies: ( Dui ? )? jX  and ( Vui ? )? jY , then we call rule Aj includes iu ,  denoted by iu ? Aj.

Supposed there exist:  (1) iu ? Aj. and (2) an item y? jY . Let yr  denote marginal profit of item y,  )(, iyD uR  denote the indirect profit gained from iu  because jX  (D? jX ) owns cross demand effect on y.

Then the cross demand effect )(, iyD uR  can be calculated by:  %)(, jyiyD cruR ?=             (5)  A transaction iu  may accord to several rules. Let y ui  A ={ AAyYAAA jjujj i ??? ,, }. According to the  definition of association rule, support degree reflects the importance level of rule. Each rule?s importance weight in set yuiA  can be calculated by:  ? ?  = y iuj  AA j  j j s  s ?                 (6)  The expected value of the cross demand effect obtained from item y in transaction iu  can be work out as follow:  ? ?  ??= y iuj  AA jjyiyD cruR ?%)(,       (7)  According to above mentioned principle, the estimation algorithm of total profit ),( ??DR  is designed as follow:  Estimation of total profit of a decision D Run transaction simulation procedure by parameters: ? and ?

GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR ITEMS SELECTION       Wong has proved that the maximal-profit item selection problem researched in this paper is NP-hard. Thus a genetic algorithm is used for this problem. The genetic algorithm can be viewed as an optimization method which encodes a possible solution of a problem in a chromosome-like data structure. This approach creates a number of chromosomes in a population and finds a solution by rearranging the chromosomes in the population. Some key steps of this approach are described as follow.

5.1 Encoding  For the encoding, we take a string of 0's and 1's which is called a chromosome. First, set index for each item in set I, and the bit position of a chromosome string is the index of each item. If the value of a bit is 1, it means that the corresponding item is selected in set D. If the value of a bit is 0, the item is selected into set V. e.g. if the coding of a certain chromosome is 001100?, this encoding means that item #3 and #4 are selected into D and item #1, #2, #5, #6 are selected into V.

5.2 Fitness function  When items in set D are selected to be displayed in shelf space, the total profit of set D, ),( ??DR , can be estimated by above-mentioned estimation algorithm which is based on transaction simulation.

5.3 Initial solution population  Let Tr xx ?? ?  be the direct profit estimation of the item x. For forming initial chromosome, we just rank items by their direct profit estimation from high to low and set different selected probability accordingly for them: setting higher selected probability for the item with higher profit, setting lower selecting probability for the item with lower profit. We select the items stochastically according to their selected probability. If an item is selected, its? bit value in a chromosome is marked as ?1?, otherwise, marked as ?0?. When we have selected m items, one chromosome is formed.

After a chromosome is formed, we can repeat this step from the beginning until k initial chromosomes are formed.

5.4 Crossover and Mutation  1. The genetic algorithm firstly randomly selects pairs of individual chromosomes for reproducing next generation. The probability of a chromosome being selected is proportional to its fitness function value.

2. Comparing the bit value of parent chromosomes, and entail the bit with same position value to offspring chromosomes. Now there are still some bits without value in the offspring chromosomes, this means that these bits have not inherited value from parent chromosomes. In order to ensure that there are just m  bits with value 1 in offspring chromosomes, crossover operator should continue steps as follow:  a) Working out the number of bits with value 1 on the offspring chromosome. Suppose there are r bits with value ?1?, then there will be m-r bits to get value 1 in those bits without value.

b) Getting out all the bit position index of bits without value. According to these position indexes, scan all the bit values at the same position in parent chromosomes. If there is a bit with value 1 at the same position in either of the parent chromosomes, then set the bit in offspring chromosome with value 1 .

c) Repeat b) until the number of bits with value 1 becomes m. Set value 0 for other empty bits.

3. After crossover procedure, we get some offspring chromosomes from previous generation chromosomes.

Then Select one chromosome from the offspring chromosomes with a low probability (for example the probability 0.5%) to run mutation process. In order to ensure that there are just m bits with value 1 in a chromosome after mutation, we do the following mutation operation to the chromosome:  a) Select one bit from bits with value 0 stochastically, and change the value to 1.

b) Select one bit from bits with value 1 stochastically, and change the value to 0.

6. EXPETIMENT   From the observation on transaction records in a certain convenience store in Shanghai, we obtained a set transaction sample of 300 kinds of items in fifteen days.

The quantity of shelves with high effect is relatively small. Having calculated the probability distribution of each item or items combination purchased from sample data, we work out 70 frequent item set. Then we designed a simulation program to produce transaction data during a period of time.

Table 1 Comparison between two methods  m Profitability of m items  Genetic algorithm Direct profit ranking  31% 37% 41% 46% 51% 57%  21% 23% 27% 31% 36% 41%   The results of the experiments are shown in table 1. In the table 1, the figure m denotes the number of items selected to be displayed in high effect shelf. we measure the total profit (direct and indirect profit) of m selected items, and the profitability is the percentage of the total profit in all the simulated data set. Table 1 demonstrates the comparison of profit effect by two items selection methods when m varies. The average profitability of genetic algorithm is 48% higher than direct profit ranking method.

7. CONCLUSION  In this paper, we explored how to optimize product assortment of high effect shelf. A simulation-based genetic algorithm is developed which can find optimal solution according the demand parameters. The simulation module makes the fitness function value of genetic algorithm keep consistent with the future demand state. Thus, the genetic algorithm can adjust product assortment if the demand state change at any time. The experiment result shows that approach presented in this paper can make full use of high effect shelf space of a retail store.
