Abstract? The traditional sequential pattern algorithms often have some limitations in solving the applications. First, ignore the time-interval trait of the event sequences, which is more important to the mining result. Secondly, the sequential item is also without attribute constraint. As a result, in this paper an idea is presented to mine event sequential pattern with multi- attribute constraint. Based on the algorithm of AprioriAll and Apriori, the transition time is taken into account between events.

According to the layer idea, the key task is to mine the frequent sequential pattern first, then to find out the association rules in the attribute constraint items. In the end provides a way to mine sequential pattern with multi-attribute constraint by example analysis.

I.  INTRODUCTION Mining sequential pattern is an important task in data  mining. The purpose is to find out the frequent sequential pattern in the sequential database [1, 2]. At present there has been a wide application in client behavior analyses, Web accessing mode, DNA sequence, disease examine, nature disaster and so on. Great deals of studies have been done in sequential pattern mining, such as classical algorithm: AprioriAll, AprioriSome and GSP. Then, it is given to mine sequential patterns by pattern-growth: the FreeSpan and PrefixSpan approach [4, 5, 6].

However, the algorithms often have some limitations in solving the practice problems [3, 7, 8]. Firstly, the time-trait of sequence is ignored. For example, to the sequence ?ABC?, we can know the order of events clearly, but the time-intervals of events can?t be provided, which usually contain more important information in some application conditions. Secondly, the events are simplex event, not attribute constraint. That is, in many application domains the association rule A?B can?t reflect the exact thing. We put stress on the rule {A (attribute1, attribute 2,?)?B(attribute A, attribute B,? )}. For example, the rule like {sensor exceeding-value log (exceeding- time>2minites, etc.)?breaker action (delay action, etc.)} is available instead of the rule {sensor fault log ? breaker action}.



II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION The study is based on the data source in the following  TABLE I. In the sequences the events have the time identifiers that indicate not only the orders of the events, but also the transition time of events. Moreover, every event has several attribute constraint. The trait is: a) The event items of the sequences are few, commonly short sequence; b) the transition time of events is more important; c) several attribute constraint.

The aim is to discover the association rule of events by the sequence pattern mining.

III. SEQUENTIAL PATTERN MINING AND ASSOCIATE RULE MINING OF EVENT SEQUENCE  For the completeness of this presentation and to establish our notation, this section gives a formal description of the problem of mining sequential patterns.

Let 1 2{ , , }nI i i i=  be a set of items. An itemsets is a subset of I , denoted as 1 2( , , )kx x x , where ix I? ,  {1, , }i k? . We omit the parentheses for itemsets with only one item. A sequence s is a list of itemsets, denoted as 1 2 ms s s< > , where iS I? , {1, , }i m? . The number of instances of itemsets in s is called the length of s.

A sequence 1 2, , ja a a a=< > is a sub-sequence of another sequence 1 2, , jb b b b=< > , k j? , if there exists an integer i , 1 1i k j? ? ? + ,such that 1 ia b? , 2 1, ,ia b +?  1j i ja b + ?? . a is called contained in b , denoted as a b? , and b is a super-sequence of a.

A sequence database is a set of tuples <sid, s>  is said to contain a sequence ? , if s? ? . The absolute support of a sequence ?  in a database D is defined as ( )DSup ? = |{ , | ( ) ( , )} |Sid s s Sid s D?< > ? ? < >? , and the relative support of ?  is ( ) / | |DSup s D . Given a positive value minSup as the support threshold, ? is a sequential pattern in D if  ( ) minDSup Sup? ? . Given a support threshold minSup , a sequence is frequent if its support is no less than minSup. The set of frequent sequential patterns denoted as FS = { | ( ) min }DSup Sup? ? ? .

Definition: supposing that the sub-sequence 1 2, , jc c c c=< >  is frequent sequential pattern, the event items (1 )kc k j? ? are established with the ordinal occurrence. The sequential relation indicates the association of events.

The sequence ?ABC? with constraint conditions is the frequent sequential pattern, then the association rule ?A?B? C? comes into existence. As a result, multi-attribute Event Sequential Pattern mining is deemed to discover frequent sub- sequential pattern.



IV. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING OF MULTI-ATTRIBUTE EVENT SEQUENTIAL PATTERN  A. The disposal of event sequences? time-interval To event sequence in this paper, the exact occurrence time  isn?t cared. However, besides the sequences? order, the transition time of events is more indispensable. Deal with the transaction time (the record time) as one of the attributes, time constraint. The first item of every event sequences is marked with 0 as the time-trait, the following items marked with time- interval. The time-interval determines the transitional time among the event items.

For sequence database in TABLE I, the sequence 1 is deal with as the following TABLE II.

TABLE II.   EVENT SEQUENCE DATA WITH TIME CONSTRAINT  Sid Event TimeSpan Attri.1 Attri.2 Attri.3   A 0 a11 a12 a13  B 5 b11 b12 b13  C 13 c11 c12 c13  D 22 d11 d12 d13  ? ? ? ? ? ? Notice: The field TimeSpan ignores the second.

As shown as the TABLE III, the transitional time from A to B is 5 minutes, 8 minutes from B to C and 22 minutes from A to D. Especially, when the events A and B occur simultaneously, the Time Span keeps uniform. After dealing with that, reduce the complexity of the table while keep the time-trait of the original sequence, which provide convenience for association rule mining.

B. The transformation of the event sequences database To mine the association rules among the event items from  the sequence database, the database in TABLE III must be transformed and disposed of. The sequence 1 is transformed as following:  Sequence 1: {A?0?a11?a12?a13??B?5?b11? b12?b13??C?13?c11?c12?c13??D?22?d11? d12?d13?}  The event items include multi-attribute constraint. In view of the algorithm of mining sequential patterns, the attributes of events are discarded firstly. They will be taken account into later. As a result, the TABLE I is transformed as the TABLE III.

TABLE III.  CONVERTED EVENT SEQUENCE DATASHEET  Sid Event  1 A B C D  2 A B D  3 A B E  4 B C D  C. Association rule mining layer-based When event sequences discard the attribute constraint, the  rule set will be enlarged inevitably. The rule like {A ( ia ) ? B ( ib )} is only one part of the rule {A ? B}. Propose association rule layer-based to deal with the problem. First, disclose the association rule from the high-layer, omitting the attribute constraint of events; secondly, mine the low-layer association rule on the basis of first step. The algorithm is described as following:  a) A ? B; b) A(a?b?c) ? B(x?y?z).

In which, A and B is the event items which omit the  attribute constraint.

A (a, b, c) is the event item which contain the constraint condition a, b and c.

B (x, y, z) is the event item which contain the constraint condition x, y and z.

The rule A ? B is explained as the event (B) will occur immediately after the event (A) does. The rule like A (a?b? c) ? B(x?y?z) is interpreted as when the event (A) occurs in the condition (a, b, c),the event (B) will be the state (x, y, z) or come in the condition (x, y, z).

When the rule A ? B is not established, the rule A (a?b? c) ? B(x?y?z) is fallacious. So, the tough association rule A(a?b?c) ? B(x?y?z) relies on the rule A ? B. The first step achieves the rough select and the second attains the precise pick.

The key explanation:  1) A ? B: Adopt the classical algorithm AprioriAll. The data resource is composed of short sequences, so only take seeking the frequent sequence into account, not longest sequence. The sequential patterns of the events are emphasized primarily.

Algorithm description: Input: sequence database transformed (D), minimum support Output: the complete frequent sequential patterns set in D  L1 = {large 1-sequence}; FOR(k=2; Lk-1??; k++) DO BEGIN Ck = AprioriALL-generate (Lk-1); FOR each customer-sequence c in D DO  Sum the count of all candidates in Ck that are contained in c;  Lk = Candidates in Ck with minimum support; END  2) A(a?b?c) ? B(x?y?z): AAfter a), supposed that the rule A ? B is established, then return to the TABLE III and pick the attribute items of the events A and B from the sequence database to form the new database, attribute database. Sequentially, mine the most frequent items from the attribute database by the algorithm Apriori. In the course of mining, we only discover the frequent items, without regard to build the association rule.

For sequence database in TABLE III, the attribute database is formed as the following TABLE IV.

TABLE IV.  ATTRIBUTE DATABASE  Sid A B  Attr.1 Attr.2 Attr.3 Attr.1 Attr.2 Attr.3 1 a11 a12 a13 b11 b12 b13  2 a21 a122 a23 b21 b22 b23  3 a31 a32 a33 b31 b32 b33  ? ? ? ? ?  ?  3) Taking a) and b) into account, get the association rule with multi-attribute constraint.

4) The minimum support of two layers can be set respectively.

5) The influence of transition time. Given the time threshold (20), the rule like A(0?a11?a12) ? B(30?b21? b23) should be discarded.

In a word, when mine the association rule like A ( ia ) ? B (  jb ) two steps are carried out. First, find the rule A ? B. then, seek the rule A ( ia ) ? B ( jb ) based on the first step. It effectively provides the available method to solve the multi- attribute Event Sequential Pattern mining.



V. APPLICATION AND ANALYSIS The data source is the tele-measure logs table named  ycOverRecords200402 from traction power supply SCADA system. The following is proposed in detail.

Adopt the clustering algorithm FCM(fuzzy c- means).

2) Event sequence database with time constraint: In the event sequences database the event items are replaced with A, B, C, D, E, etc. The step 1) and 2) is shown in the talbe 6.

TABLE VI.  DISCRETE EVENT SEQUENCE DATABASE WITH TIME CONSTRAINT  Sid Event span ycVal extre keep  1 A 0 1 3 3 B 11 1 4 2  A 0 2 3 4 B 21 1 2 2 C 21 0 0 2  3 A 0 2 2 2 B 6 4 4 1  4 A 0 1 2 1 E 0 0 0 1  5 B 0 4 4 3 A 9 1 1 1  6 A 0 1 2 4 B 18 4 4 0  7 A 0 1 3 4 B 16 4 4 3   A 0 2 2 3 C 6 0 0 2 C 6 0 0 2 F 6 0 0 2  ? ? ? ? ? ?     3) A ? B: Supposed that min-sup=60%, the result of AprioriAll mining is the rule A?B.

4) A(a?b?c) ?  B(x?y?z): Supposed that transition time min-span=16, min-sup=60%, then the result of Apriori is {A (ycValue=1, extremum=3) B (ycValue=4, extremum=4)}.

The last rule is described as A(ycValue=low ? extremum=high) ? B(ycValue=very high? extremum=very high) and the transition time is no more than 16 minutes.

CONCLUSIONS The event Sequence contains several attribute constraints,  and emphasizes the transition time completely. In this paper a method is proposed to mine the association rule of event sequence with multi-attribute in the application domains. By the sequential patterns and association rule mining we can extract the association relation of events. In view of the limitation of algorithm, much work must be done in the future.
