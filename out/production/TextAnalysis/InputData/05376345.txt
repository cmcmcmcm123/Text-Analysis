I.  INTRODUCTION With the rapid development of computer network and  data mining, tremendous amount of data collection and ?golden nuggets? of knowledge mining has become more and more convenient. These have contributed greatly to business strategies, scientific and medical research. In reality, however, privacy-preserving in data mining is an unavoidable question. Sensitive information, such as customer buying habits, electronic medical record, bankcard client?s transaction behavior, will be leaked. The emergence of these problems brings a new challenge to data sharing and traditional data mining. In the process of data mining, how to resolve the problem of privacy- preserving has become a hot research topic in data mining field.

At present, privacy-preserving data mining methods can be roughly divided from four aspects.

? According to the basic strategy of original data hiding, they can be divided into data perturbation [1], query restriction and mixed strategies.

? According to data mining techniques, they can be divided into association rules mining [2], classification and clustering mining, etc.

? According to privacy preserving techniques, they can be divided into heuristic technique, encryption and reconfigurable technique.

? According to distribution of data resources, they can be divided into privacy-preserving centralized database mining and privacy-preserving distributed database mining.

Combining the advantages of both RSA public-key cryptosystem and homomorphic encryption scheme, an effective privacy-preserving distributed mining algorithm of association rules (PPDM-ARBSM), which is based on ARBSM algorithm [3], is proposed in this paper. A model of hierarchical management on the cryptogram is adopted in the algorithm.



II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION  A.  Basic concepts Rule support and confidence are two important concepts  in association rules. They respectively reflect the usefulness and certainty of discovered rules. That is,  support (A?B) = P(A?B), confidence(A?B) = P(B ?A).

Rules that satisfy both a minimum support threshold  (min_sup) and a minimum confidence threshold (min_conf) are called strong [4].

In general, association rule mining can be viewed as a two-step process:  (1)Find all frequent itemsets. Support count of these itemsets will be no less than a predetermined minimum support count.

(2)Generate strong association rules from the frequent itemsets. Confidences of these rules must be no less than a predetermined minimum confidence.

The second step is easy to be realized on the basis of the first step, and they have nothing to do with a set of transactions database D. Therefore, the key of privacy preserving association rule mining lies in finding accurate frequent itemsets without precise access to the original data.

In this paper, data resources distribution adopt distributed database models in which fragmentation schema use horizontal fragmentation and allocation schema is ?the best adaptation? and non-redundant. Let S1,S2,?,St (t>2), be a set of sites where they respectively store local transactions  database, D1,D2,?, Dt ,   ? t  i  =  = i  DD  , i=1,2,?,t.

DOI 10.1109/AICI.2009.486     B. RSA  public-key cryptosystem 1) Exchangeable cryptographic algorithm Exchangeable cryptographic algorithm is an important  tool on privacy-preserving protocol. As shown in the algorithm, for any given a set of cryptogram, K1, K2, ?, Kn, the encrypted results are nothing to do with the encrypted sequences, and the probability that the encrypted results are the same for different information is almost zero.

Definition 1   A cryptographic algorithm can be exchanged.

For any given a set of cryptogram, K1, K2, ?, Kn ?K and any given M1, M2 in an itemset M and any replacement i, j, the following two equations are satisfied.

)()( 1ki1 ???? kjnkjkin EEEE =  .                            ?1?  2121 ,, MMMMM ??? , and given kk 2 1, <?  ?<= )))(((()))((( 2111 ???? MEEprMEEpr kjnkjkinki  .      ?2? We say that the cryptographic algorithm can be  exchanged.

2) RSA public-key cryptographic algorithm  RSA public-key cryptosystem was named after its inventor, R.Rivest, A.Shamir and L.Adleman. So far RSA is the most widely used in public-key cryptosystem. Its security depends on the fact of number theory that factorization of big integer is very difficult.

RSA algorithm: a) Randomly generate two different large prime  numbers in similar size: p and q.

b) Compute: n=p?q and Euler function ?= (p-1)?(q-  1)? c) Randomly choose an integer e, 1<e<?, such that  gcd(e, ?)=1.

d) Calculate an unique integer d such that  e?d?1  (mod ?).

e) Obtain: (n, e) is public-key (i.e., encryption key).  d  is private key (i.e. ,decryption key).

f) Encrypt: c=me mod n where m is the information  (that is, plaintext), and c is ciphertext.

g) Decrypt: m=cd mod n.

In RSA algorithm, n, e, d  are called modular, encryption exponent and decryption exponent, respectively. In [5], under the premise that large prime numbers p and q are determined, the conclusion that RSA public-key cryptographic algorithm satisfies the exchangeability has been proved in detail.  Any cryptographic algorithm, which satisfies (1) (2), can be applied to the PPDM-ARBSM algorithm presented in this paper.

C. Homomorphic encryption scheme Sander and Tschudin defined additive-multiplicative  homomorphic encryption scheme (HES) in the integer ring.

Common addition and multiplication are homomorphic in the integer ring, and therefore homomorphic encryption scheme in the integer ring is easy. Here, we give a brief sketch of a type of HES[6].

Let R and S be integer rings. If there exist PLUS algorithm and MULT algorithm such that  E(a + b)= PLUS(E(a),E( b)), E(a?b)= MULT(E(a), E(b)).

where R  represent plaintext data, S represent ciphertext  data, a, b?R, E is an encryption function(E:R?S), we called they satisfies additively homomorphic and multiplicatively homomorphic, respectively. According to the above, we can construct encryption and decryption algorithms and perform computation.

Encryption algorithm: E(x)=(x+ r?q ) mod n                                   (function 1)  where p and q are two large prime numbers, r is a random integer, n=p ? q, PLUS is common addition, MULT is common multiplication.

Decryption algorithm:    x=E-1(y)= y mod q,  y=E(x).

Notice that there is one to many relationship between  plaintext x and ciphertext E(x) (i.e., for any x, although E1(x) ? E2(x), D(E1(x))=D(E2(x))).



III. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ARBSM ALGORITHM In ARBSM algorithm [3], we has given two important  definitions as follows and related properties (properties is abbreviated).

Definition 2 Similarity  For an Boolean matrix of transaction mnA ?= )a( ij , similarity of transactions Tl and Tk is defined as the number that the values of corresponding column are 1 for two distinct rows Al  and Ak,  l ? k . That is,  Sim(Tl ,Tk)=?(ali ?aki)?where l?k and i=1,2, ? , m.

Definition 3  Similarity matrix of transactions   For an  Boolean matrix of transactions mnA ?= )a( ij , similarity matrix of transactions S is defined as    S=AAT.

ARBSM algorithm steps: ?  Construct Boolean matrix of transaction A.

?  Compress A.

?  Calculate similarity matrix of transactions S.

?  Calculate directly K frequent itemsets.



IV. PPDM-ARBSM ALGORITHM Combining the advantages of both the RSA public-key  encryption and homomorphic encryption, an effective privacy preserving distributed mining algorithm of association rules (PPDM-ARBSM), which is based on ARBSM[3], is proposed in this paper. In the following discussion, first, the PPDM-ARBSM algorithm framework is proposed. Next, we will give integrated algorithm of PPDM- ARBSM.

A. PPDM-ARBSM algorithm framework Suppose that there are t sites S1?S2???St where t>2.

They respectively store local transactions database D1,D2,?  ,Dt, where ? t  i  =  = i  DD ,i=1,2, ? ,t. PPDM-ARBSM  algorithm framework is shown in Fig.1.

Figure 1.   PPDM-ARBSM algorithm framework.

Then we illustrate all the symbols which appear in Fig.1.

IDi is dynamic password identity authentication of site Si.

Eei(qi) represent that prime number qi in HES of Si was encrypted with public key ei. Ei(Ai) represent that Boolean- matrix Ai was encrypted with HES. Ddi(Ci) represent that Ci sent from site Si was decrypted with private key di, and let their encrypted result be qi.

In the PPDM-ARBSM algorithm framework, we introduce the concepts of cryptosystem management server (CMS), data mining server (DMS). The encrypted and decrypted process of the whole algorithm is described below.

(1)CMS?Si: IDi, ei ; CMS?DMS: di CMS generate separately dynamic password identity  authentication of site Si, public key and private key password pairs (ei, di) using pseudorandom generator technique and RSA public-key cryptographic algorithm, and send IDi and ei to DMS.

(2) Si?DMS : Ei(Ai), Eei(qi)=Ci First, each Si chooses two large prime numbers in similar  size: P and q. Then?each Si encrypts Ai with  Ei (function 1), and encrypts qi with public key ei of Si, and the result is Ci.

(3) DMS? Ddi(Ci)=qi, Ai=E-1(y)=y mod qi , y=Ei(Ai) First, DMS decrypts separately Ci with corresponding  private key di of RSA, and the result is qi. Finally, DMS decrypts Ei(Ai) with qi, the result is Ai.

B. Integrated mining algorithm of PPDM-ARBSM Algorithm 1: PPDM-ARBSM Input: t site S1, S2,? , St, where t >2.

Output: Lk, k-frequent itemsets in a database of  transactions D.

Step 1 //CMS Identity Authentication for (i=1;i<=t ; i++) ?Pseudorandom generator generate Dynamic Key(IDi);  Transport IDi to site Si ; ?  Step 2 //CMS generate and send public-key for RSA for (i=1; i<=t ; i++) ?Generate (ei,di) using RSA algorithm;  Transport  ei  to site Si ; Transport  di  to site DMS; ?  Step 3 //for each site, Ai compression and RSA encryption Scan each site Si (i<=t); Generate Boolean-matrix of transactions Ai; Compress each Ai (i<=t); //Using conclusion 1-3 in [3].

for (i=1; i<=t ; i++) ?Choose two large security primes pi, qi ; Generate a random number ri; Ei(Ai);  //encrypt Ai with HES  Ci =Eei(qi); // encrypt qi with public key ei of RSA Delete pi, ri; // ri  is a random integer  Transport Ei(Ai), Ci to DMS; ?  Step 4 //DMS decryption and k-frequent itemsets generation for (i=1; i<=t ; i++) ?qi= Ddi(Ci);  Ai=E-1(y)=y mod qi, y=Ei(Ai); A=A?Ai; ?  Compress A; ARBSM(A); Lk=?Lk; Return  Lk ?

V. ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF ALGORITHM The purpose of privacy-preserving data mining is to  discover accurate, useful and potential patterns and rules without precise access to the original data. Therefore, evaluating a privacy-preserving data mining algorithm often requires three key indicators, such as privacy (security), accuracy and efficiency.

Privacy: In this paper, cryptogram management at different levels was adopted in PPDM-ARBSM algorithm.

First, site Si encrypts Ai with Ei (function 1) of HES. Then, site Si encrypts encryption parameter qi of HES with public key ei of RSA. Hence, the algorithm can improve safety as well as increase efficiency.

Accuracy: DMS, which decrypts, compresses and conflates Boolean-matrix of transactions, and quickly generate global K-frequent itemsets using similarity matrix of transactions, is set in the algorithm. The whole process of algorithm keeps the authenticity of original data. The algorithm does not cause the decreases in accuracy for improving safety.

Efficiency: Raising efficiency of the algorithm is mainly shown the decreases in time complexity. PPDM-ARBSM algorithm reduces the time complexity mainly in two aspects. First, global K-frequent itemsets are quickly generated in order to prevent generating local frequent itemsets and greatly cut down communication costs of contrasting local support between sites. Second, tremendous     amount of Boolean-matrix Ai in site Si was encrypted with HES and we only have to encrypt encryption parameter qi of HES with public key ei of RSA. So, the algorithm avoids numerous exponent operations and improves the speed of operation greatly.



VI. EXPERIMENTS We carry on simulation experiments in PPDM-ARBSM  algorithm and ARBSM algorithm using approximate 50 thousand sample data in standard simulating data sets provided by Almaden Research Center of IBM in order to test executive efficiency of the two algorithms. The results are shown in Fig.2.

As shown in Fig.2, the higher K value is, the more efficient generation of K-frequent itemsets can be. PPDM- ARBSM algorithm which adopts a model of hierarchical management on the cryptogram costs much more running time than ARBSM algorithm, and causes the decreases in efficiency of mining. However, this is quite acceptable.
