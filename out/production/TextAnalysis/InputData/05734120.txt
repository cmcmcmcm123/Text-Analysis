A Novel Web Recommender System Considering  Users? Need Evolution

Abstract? The recommender systems? task is to predict items in which a user might like in future. Typically they do it in two stages. One, offline stage, that extracts patterns from mining users? historical behavior, and another, online stage predicts items by matching the active requests with the patterns; but without considering other interests of the active user. In general, web users? navigations contain gradual evolution of their needs.

We conducted an approach that addresses the evolving nature of users? needs and interests in making recommendations. Since users? behaviors are not stable and their interest changes with time, our approach is based on interest-drifting. One of the main shortcomings of interest-drifting based approaches is that they assume different users have the similar interest changes over time and do not consider this important factor that the trend of interest changes for users is different. This paper attempts to tackle this problem, too. Up to now there has not been any study to tackle these problems. We evaluate our proposed methodology on EachMovie dataset. Results show a better performance than existing approaches.

I.  INTRODUCTION Web Mining (WM) is a popular technique that can be used  to discover information hidden into Web-related data by exploiting Data Mining techniques [1]. It can be used for different goals such as web recommendation systems. The recommender systems? task is to predict items in which a user might like in future. Typically they consist of two major parts: offline mining and online recommendation. In the first part, some web mining techniques are applied to historical behaviors of users to mine the navigation patterns of users. In the online recommendation part, user?s requests from his/her current active session are matched with the patterns obtained from the offline part in order to generate recommendations [2]. The most recommender systems work in this way [3,4,5,6]. They consider only current request of user and don?t pay any attention to other interests of him/her. In general, Web users? navigations contain gradual evolution of their information needs. Therefore some previous observations of users might be still of their interest. It represents that considering previous observations and related interests of the user might result predicting his/her future needs more precise. Suppose that a user has been interested in movies that actor X plays in them  before and now he/she browses movies with genre Y. Our system can suggest movies with genre Y that actor X plays in them.

In this paper we propose a novel method that is able to dynamically identify potential interests of an active user and consider this information to improve the performance of recommendations. The main idea is introducing a recommendation approach that identifies potential interests of the user and integrates it with his/her current request in making recommendation.

On the other, user?s interest changes with time. The old interest is gradually forgotten, and the new one is created. This phenomenon is called as interest-drifting [7]. User may change the items which have been rated highly in the past. For example, a man previously liked thrillers. So he rated The 39 Steps, a thriller, the highest score 5 three years ago. But he changes his interests as time goes by. Currently he dislikes thrillers. He rated The Bourne Identity, another thriller, the score 2 a month ago [8]. It represents that all observation history of a user might not include in his/her potential interest.

So, our approach is based on interest-drifting.

In the recent years, many researchers have focused on addressing user?s interest drifting problem. They assign time weights to all observations of user. Since the last observations of users represent the current users? interest better than older ones, they assign time weights to items such that the items visited recently have more contribution to the recommendation.

It?s called forgetting mechanism [7]. Sugiyama, Hatano and yoshikawa explored a type of time-based collaborative filtering with detailed analysis of user's browsing history in one day [9].

In [8] an item-based collaborative filtering algorithm has been presented to compute the time weights for different items in a manner that will assign a decreasing weight to old data. In [10] a hybrid filtering algorithm has been introduced to address interest drift. Godoy and Amandi developed a mechanism named WebProfiler, which learns a hierarchical representation of all user interests using conceptual clustering [11]. Interests at the top and bottom levels of the hierarchy can be seen as long-term short-term interests respectively. Then a time-based forgetting is used to give weight to different web paged in the hierarchy. Li and Feng has developed a computation model to estimate the user interest of the accessed pages through analyzing users? browsing behaviors; they have used a time  2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications (IST'2010)     function to give more importance to the recent observations [12]. A personalized service which recommends resources for users at massive education resources net has been proposed in [13]. A model of resource?s description and the treatment of user?s interest drift using usage and content data has been shown.  Min and Han [14] developed a modified collaborative filtering based approach which can find the active user?s neighbors according to his/her changing pattern.

One of the main shortcomings of available approaches based on interest-drifting is that they assume different users have the similar interest changes over time. In real world, the trend of interest changes in user purchase interest is different.

For example, some users? interest changes with time quickly, while others may have a stable interest.  We decided to address this problem, too. Differently from previously approaches, our method tracks and detects the drifted interests of users individually.

We evaluate the efficiency of our proposal from two aspects: (1) the impact of considering user?s interest evolution, and (2) the impact of detecting users? interest drifting individually.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes our proposed approach. The experiments are given in section III. And the paper ends with a short conclusion and some suggestions for future work in section IV.



II. THE PROPOSED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM In this section we present an approach based on web mining  techniques and interest-drifting that takes into account all potential interests of the user in making recommendations. It solves the problem of identifying drifted interests of users individually. The steps in the algorithms could be briefly summarized as follows:  a) Create a Time-to-Category Rating matrix using web page clusters and web users? ratings to detect interest drifting of users individually.

b) Calculate the weights of interests based on their importance for users.

c) Mine weighted association rules.

d) Update active user profile.

e) Recommend unseen items to the active user.

Fig. 1 shows a general view of the proposed algorithm.

In the next subsections, we will describe each step in detail.

A. Detecting User Interest Drifting In an electronic shop different users differ about purchase  behavior and, consequently the trend of their interest changes is not same. We attempt to detect changes in user interest at different periods of times individually. For this, we use a modified approach in [14]. Our proposed method is as follows:  Step 1. Cluster web pages; after preprocessing and TF-IDF weighting [15], we categorized web pages based on content similarity.

Figure 1.  The architecture of our proposal    Step 2. Produce a Time-to-Category Rating Matrix for each user; in this matrix, rows are timeframes and columns are categories found in previous step. Numbers in each row denotes ratings of user u to each item in categories. We represent the interests of a user in different timeframes by Time-to-Category Rating Matrix. Table 1 shows a Time-to- Category Rating Matrix of a user.

Step 3. Calculate category ratings; the category rating is defined as the average ratings for the items in that category and defined as follow.

ia,  k category,i k ku, rRN  1  cr ? ?  = (1)  In the above equation, cru,k is the derived rating of category k of user u, RNk is the number of rated items that belong to that category. ru,i is the rating of item i of user u. we calculate category rating for each category and each user in different timeframes. In our work, category ratings might be a good indicator for estimating the amount of importance for a particular content for each user.

Step 4. Calculate the correlation between different interests of each user in different timeframes; the calculation is done by Auto-Similarity measure (AS) which discussed in [14]. Here, it?s applied to detect a behavior change for any user. It?s found by (2).

( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )( )  ( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )( )?  ?  ?  ?  ? ?  ?  ?  k  uku,  uku,  k  uku,  k uku, T2T1,  2TT2cr  2TT2cr  1TT1cr  1TT1cr uAS  r  r  r  r  (2)  In this equation, ( ) ku,T1cr is the category rating k of user u in timeframe T1 and ( )u1Tr is the average ratings of user u in timeframe T1.

TABLE I.  TIME-TO-CATEGORY RATING MATRIX     This measure is used for detecting the degree of changes.

Auto-Similarity AS(u)T1,T2 is defined as the similarity between the user?s category ratings at timeframe T1 and the same user?s category ratings at timeframe T2.

Step 5. Detect changes; if the value of (2) is less than a predefined threshold ?, we can understand that a change in user interest has been occurred  In real world, the timeframe size is decided by how frequently the user purchase interest changes. If the user preference changes frequently or dramatically, we should assign a small size; it helps us detecting more drifting.

Conversely, if the user preference is consistent, we should increase the size of timeframe. So, timeframe size influences the performance of the algorithm.

B. Calculating the Weights of Interests To capture the real interest of a user to items, we assign a  new weight to each rating based on combining user ratings and time whenever user?s interest changes. Several reasons validate the idea of computing this hybrid weight:  ? An item with more ratings is of greater interest to customers.

? Customer preferences are time-sensitive. The item rated more recently by a user might have a larger impact on the prediction of user?s preference than an item that was rated long time ago. In the other words, recent ratings should be able to reflect user?s current interests more accurately [8].

Users? ratings recorded in dataset. Most studies applied a time-sensitive function to assign a smaller weight to old ratings and larger weight to newer ratings [8,10,11,12,13]. But these studies don?t detect drift and multiply the time function in all ratings of a user. If a user has a stable interest, it results decreasing the importance of his/her long-term interest and finally poor predictions. In this paper, we firstly detected users? interest drifting individually. Then we apply time function whenever an interest change occurs. In this case time function can decrease the importance of items related to each interest of the user.

The following example illustrates our approach in finding individually the interest drift of each user and then giving weight to each interest:  Suppose that table 1 is a Time-to-Category Rating Matrix of a user u. Ti is a timeframe. Tm represents the last timeframe user has done rating and T1 is the oldest timeframe. We compute the new weight for items using (3). Wu,j and Ru,j denote new weight of item j for user u and, rating user u has assigned  to item j. F(ti) is a time function.

)iF(t  ju,R  ju,W ?=  (3)  The value of variable ti is determined as follows:  ? Since the ratings in row Tm indicate the current interest. So, we consider ti=0 for all items in this row.

? In other rows, ti?0. If in timeframe Ti a drift is detected, then ti will be the elapsed days from Ti  to Tm. For example if Tm is November 1995 and Ti is August 1995, then ti for all items in timeframe Ti is equal to 91.

? If in timeframe Ti interest doesn?t change, then ti will be equal with the value of ti in timeframe Ti+1.

Equation (4) shows the above explanation briefly.

,T -T ,t  t  mi  1ii ? ?  ? ?  ? = = +  change interstif change interest noif  if mi  (4)  Function F(t) called time function or forgetting function. In literature, many Forgetting Functions have been introduced, for example, logistic function, sigmoid function and linear functions. Here, we choose the time function used in [10] as following:  t- e  F(t) ?=  (5)  It can satisfy our needs well. Using F(t), the value of time weight lies in the range (0,1) and the more recent data will have the higher the value.

We firstly, defined a decay rate parameter ?. Our aim is to define the rate of decay of the weight assigned to interests [10].

C. Mining Weighted Association Rules In this section, we extract weighted association rules.

Discovery of association rules has been found successful in many recommender systems. Despite classic association rule mining, weighted association rule mining allows different weights to be assigned to different items to reflect their importance to the user. The weights may represent as the profitability or popularity of different items for the user.

Weighted association rule mining pays more attention to items with higher importance [16].

We have implemented the algorithm of weighted rule mining presented in [17]. The value of minimum support and confidence was considered 0.6 and 0.5 respectively. The result     of this algorithm conceptually described as follows: ( ) ( ) ( )  ( ) }C ,S ,  w,p ,..., w,p  w,p..., ,  w,p{  r  aanknk  11kkk11a  ++  ++?= k  where  ( ) ( )} w,p..., ,  w,p{ kk11  and ( ) ( )} w,p,..., w,p{ nknk1k1k ++++  represent the left-hand  side and the right-hand side of the ath weighted rule respectively, pi represents each item and wi is the weight of the ith item. Sa and Ca are weighted support and weighted confidence of rule ath respectively.

D. Updating Active User Profile and Recommendation As mentioned before, because of evolving nature of users?  needs, we have decided to take into account related interests of the active user in prediction. Current observations of an active user in website represent his/her recent preferences. When a user enters the website and starts to visit web pages, we first update active user profile by reassigning new weights to his/her interests based on current session using technique described in sections II and subsection B.

In our evaluations of recommendation approach, we use leave-one-out method. Suppose that vector  ( ) ( )nn11 r,t ..., ,r,t  T =  is a vector in test set for an active user u where ti and ir indicate each item and the rating of user u to ti respectively. Then we apply the leave-one-out method for each (ti ,ri) in T. In this way, we eliminate a (ti ,ri) at each step, then the current user session will represent as a vector  ( ) ( )1-i1-i11 r,t ..., ,r,t  S = . Therefore, S represents current interest of u. Now we update the profile of u based on current  session and obtain ( ) ( )ss 1-i1-i11 w,t ..., , ,w,t  S =?  as the profile  of u. Now we can suggest more useful item to u by matching the sequence S with the mined historical behavior patterns.

As we said earlier, each of the weighted association rules are represented as a set of item-weight pairs. So, we can retrieve rule has the most similar left-hand side with S?. If left- hand side of the each rule is represented as a  vector ( ) ( )} w,p...,,  w,p{R rkkrii= , then the similarities will be computed using (6) [17].

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS To evaluate the performance of our proposed recommender  system, we carried out our experiments on The EachMovie dataset that have been the most widely used common datasets in recommender system researches. The EachMovie dataset has rating information on 1,628 movies by 72,916 users during an 18-month-period. Users rated various numbers of movies by rating values to values between 0 and 1. Each vote is accompanied by a date and time stamp. We have collected the content of each movie from Internet Movie Database (IMDB)1 using a web crawler. These content includes movie title, director, genre, plot summary, cast, award and user comment.

We have selected a subset of 466,245 includes 1,628 movies and 2,880 users with more than 100 rated items. We divided the dataset into a 90% for the training set and 10% for the test set.

The quality of recommendation is evaluated by Mean Absolute Error (MAE). MAE is a widely applied metric. It can be defined as the average absolute difference of predictions from the real users? ratings. In our experiments, we computed the MAE on the test set for each user (in (7)) Then averaged over the test set (in (8)). A smaller value means a better performance [10].

n  r - ar MAE  i  n  1j ji,ji,  i  i  ? ==  (7)   m  m  1i i MAE  MAE ? ==  (8)  A. Parameter Settings There are three major parameters in the proposed  mechanism: (1) the timeframes size in section I and subsection A. (2) The threshold ? used to determine the correlation of user interests in different timeframes. (3) The decay rate ? in (5).

We conduct a series of preliminary experiments to find the optimal performance obtained for each parameter when the value of other is constant.

1) Experiment (1): impact of the Timeframe size In the first experiment, we change the timeframe size from  1, 2, and 3 to 4 months. The impact of using different values is demonstrated in Figure 2. This parameter value depends on the speed of the users interest change. It is found that timeframe size dramatically influences the performance of the algorithm.

It?s necessary to assign different values to this parameter to obtain the best performance. When the speed of changes is high, the size must be selected smaller.

2) Experiment (2): impact of ? We vary values of ? to evaluate its influence on the  performance of algorithm. Results are showed in figure 3. As   1  www.imdb.com     we can see from the results, MAE values increase with ?.

Recall that, in Section II, if the similarity of two interests is less than ?, it means a drift occurs. So, when ? increases, more interest drifts will determine. It is while that two interests may be similar but when the value of ? is larger, they may consider distinct. Therefore it seems reasonable that the higher value of ? causes the higher value of MAE is.

3) Experiment (3): impact of ? To experimentally determine the impact of the decay rate  on the quality of the prediction, we selectively vary the parameter ? to 0.05, 0.02, and 0.01. The higher the value of ? in (5), the faster old data decays and the lower the importance of the historical information compared to more recent data. Fig.

4 shows the MAEs of the proposed algorithm in different cases.

B. Overall Performance In order to demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm,  some experiments have been conducted. We evaluate the efficiency of our proposal from two aspects: (1) the impact of considering user?s interest evolution, and (2) the impact of detecting users? interest drifting individually. Therefore, we compare results with the approach of [10] and the classic approach that did not consider other interests of active user in prediction. Ma, Li, Ding and Orlowska [10] used collaborative filtering with interest-drifting in which users have assumed to have similar interest-drifting over time. We re-implement this method and compare it with our approach. For second approach, we consider a classic weighted association rule mining where recommendation is done based on active session alone. Also, weights are only user ratings and no forgetting function used. Here, we called it C-WARM. The results are evaluated based on MAE metric and showed in figure 5. We can see that our proposed approach performs 6.80% better than [10] and 1.42% better than C-WARM.

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we developed a novel approach based on web  mining techniques and interest-drifting which addresses the evolving nature of users? needs in making recommendations.

Our approach takes into account all related interests of the active user to making more accurate predictions. Also, it was able to detect user?s interest changes individually and assign weights to drifted preferences of users not to all of them to improve the existence methods. The proposed algorithm consists of five phases of (1) detecting interest changes individually, (2) calculating weights, (3) mining behavior pattern, (4) updating active user profile and (5) recommendation.

We conducted experiments to evaluate the prediction quality on the EachMovie dataset and compared them with the approach of [10] and the classic approach that ignore other potential interest of user. The results show the proposed methodology has the better precision in both individually detecting users? interest changes and address evolving nature of user interests. If a system is not aware of all interests of user its prediction will be poor.

As future work, we intend to evaluate our methodology using other data set. Since the timeframe size has significant impact on the performance of our algorithm, it can be useful to employ heuristics methods to adapt its value for each customer.

Also, we decide to use a time window like [18] to consider only recent profile of users instead of considering all their profile in making prediction, and apply adaption mechanism to adapt the size of window.
