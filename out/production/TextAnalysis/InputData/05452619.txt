Keywords-Association rule mining; frequent closed itemset

I. Introduction Association rule mining (ARM) is one of the most  important data mining techniques. ARM aims at extraction, hidden relation, and interesting associations between the existing items in a transactional database.

The main step in association rule mining is the mining frequent itemsets, and time cost in ARM is due to this step.

Frequent itemsets mining often generates a very large number of frequent itemsets and rules. As such, it not only reduces the efficiency, but also decreases the power of mining. To overcome the problem, in recent years condensed representation has been used for frequent itemsets. A popular condensed representation method is using to frequent closed itemsets in which instead of mining all frequent itemsets, only association mining is required to mine the closed  frequent itemsets and their association rules. Compared with frequent itemsets, the frequent closed itemsets is a much more limited set but with similar power. In addition, it decreases redundant rules and increases mining efficiency.

In recent years, a large number of algorithms have been proposed about frequent closed itemsets mining due to the importance of them. Here, some of them are introduced and compared.

This article is structured as follows; frequent closed itemsets and relevant topics are introduced in section 2 . Section 3 deals with the most important algorithms of frequent closed itemsets mining. Different classifications and algorithm comparison are sketched  in section 4. Section 5 evaluates the experimental and section 6 concludes on the results.



II. Problem Development Let D be a transactional database. Each  transactional database includes a set of transactions.

Each transaction t is represented by <TID, x> in which x is a set of items and TID is the unique identifier of transaction. Further, let us consider I = {i1, i2, ?, in} as the complete set of distinct items in D. Each non- empty subset y of I is termed an itemset, and if includes k items, it would be called k-itemset. The number of transactions existing in D including itemset y, is called the support of itemset y, denoted as sup(y) and it is usually represented in percentage. Given a minimum support, min-sup, an itemset y is frequent itemset, if sup(y) ? min-sup.

Definition1- Closed Itemset: An itemset y is a closed itemset if there is not any superset of y like y' that sup(y) = sup(y').

The precise definition of closed itemset, however, is based on Relations (1) and (2). Let us consider T, y and then respectively IyDT ?? ,  are subset of all items and transactions appeared in D. Then functions f and g are defined based on Relations (1) and (2).

},|{)( tiTtIiTf ????=  (1)  },|{)( tiyiDtyg ????=  (2)   Considering these two functions, an itemset y is a  closed itemset, if and only if Relation (3) is held.

h(y )= f(g(y)) = fog(y )= y  (3)   The combinational function h = fog is called closure  operator. If a closed itemset is frequent, it is called frequent closed itemset.

Definition 2- Generator: An itemset p is a generator of a closed itemset y if p is one of the itemsets (there may be more than one) that determines y using Galois closure operator: h(p) = y.

III. Main algorithms in frequent closed itemsets mining  The frequent closed itemsets mining algorithms can be put in two classes. The first class follows the breath- first-search method, while the second class employs the depth-first-search method.

A. First Class Algorithms  1)   A-Closed Algorithm: A-close algorithm is a basic algorithm in frequent closed itemsets mining which is based on Apriori algorithm[1] in frequent item mining. A-close operation is performed in the following two general steps: Producing frequent generators and achieving closure of frequent generators. For A-close algorithm, an itemset p is generator of closed itemset y, if p is one of smallest itemsets (it may be more than one), and it determines y with Galois closure operator h(p)=y  [5].

To produce generators, a level-wise approach, similar to that of Apriori algorithm is taken. Then three steps of pruning are conducted on candidate generators, and useless generators are pruned thereby[5]. The operation of generator production is repeated until no other generator is produced.

After producing generators G1 to Gn (n is maximum generator size), closure of all these frequent generators should be computed. The closure of all frequent generators results in all closed frequent itemsets. The method for computing closure is based on proposition 1  Proposition1.  The closure of generator p which is achieved by applying function h from Relation (3) on p, is intersection of all database transactions that include p  A-close algorithm uses breath-first-search strategy for mining operation, and itemset lattice is analyzed in a bottom-up way. Its weak point is the great number of candid items and passes from dataset, leading to much time and memory in large datasets.

B. Second Class Algorithms  These algorithms are totally different from those of first class. Due to depth traversal of itemset lattice, here there is no need to pass from dataset in each level, and the count of passes is usually one or two. Next, the dataset is changed to a tree-like structure, and mining is performed on it.

1) Charm Algorithm: Charm algorithm is different from other coexisting algorithms [9]. In this algorithm, a vertical format is used for data. The vertical format includes a list of items that for each item a list of transactions in which the item is occurred is stored. This list reminds the function g in relation (2). All algorithms presented until that time and most algorithms after Charm use horizontal format for working with data. The  horizontal dataset includes a list of transactions and each transaction has a list of transaction items.

Unlike all former association mining algorithms that mined only itemsets space, Charm performs mining in both spaces of items and transactions simultaneously.

Charm algorithm starts to build a lattices with the existing data available in dataset. It centers around the idea that each node in the lattice should be processed so that all its children are frequent. All infrequent ones and non-closed branches are pruned. The children of each node are created by combination of one node with its siblings that are located in the next branches. If one sibling is pruned due to being infrequent or non-closed, it can be ignored. While usually a lexicographic order is considered for branching, it is shown that branching based on support ascending order increases the performance of Charm algorithm.

The lattice formation in Charms involves considering one branch and node for all single itemsets like x, and labeling it as  x?g(x) (g indicates function in relation2). Then, for combining two pairs such as x1?g1   and its sibling  x2?g2  four conditions is considered[9]. Therefore, all frequent closed itemsets are mined.

2) closet Algorithm: The format and framework of Closet is based on FP-growth [3] algorithm in frequent itemsets mining [6]. The method used in this algorithm is depth-first-search, and it uses FP-tree[3] structure, and narrows the mining from dataset to FP-tree mining.

The Closet operation is conducted in three steps:  a) Finding frequent items: In first step, like all algorithms the goal is searching frequent single items.

Therefore, a set of frequent single items and the support number related to support descending order is put in a list called f-list.

b)  Partitioning the search space and forming conditional database: Like FP-growth algorithm whose search for frequent items is partitioned to n sub-problem (n represents frequent single items), here the space partitioning and formation of conditional database is performed based [6] . The process of partitioning can be recursive, and each sub-set or sub-problem for frequent closed itemsets can be partitioned further when necessary.

c) Identify the frequent closed itemsets from conditional databases: some lemmas and optimizations provides the theoretical foundation that closet can find frequent closed itemsets correctly[6].

The Close algorithm uses many optimizations for saving time and memory. But its main problem like FP- growth is that it requires a large memory in sparse databases, as in such databases FP-tree occupies large space due to limited  prefixes.

3) Closet+ Algorithm: Closet+ was developed thanks to the best presented techniques at the time and adding some new optimal methods as well [7].

Closet+ uses the divide-and-conquer method such as FP-growth for mining frequent closed itemsets. It follows the depth-first-search and it is attested that it is more efficient than breadth-first-search in mining closed itemsets. This algorithm uses FP-tree as compress technique. The calculation of frequent items with a specific prefix is done by a hybrid tree-projection which enhances the memory. In algorithms such as Closet the projection of conditional database in a bottom-up manner is used in mining the frequent closed itemsets. However, as noted earlier, Closet algorithm had drawback in sparse databases as it needed large memory. The hybrid tree-projection method creates the conditional databases by two ways: bottom-up physical tree-projection for dense databases, and top-down pseudo tree-projection for sparse databases.The Closet+ is the developed version of Closet algorithm aiming at solving its problem as far as large memory requirement concerned. This algorithm employs the horizontal format for recording transactions, and as such, it is analyzed along with Charm algorithm as one algorithm based on vertical format.

In addition to hybrid tree-projection technique, this algorithm uses techniques like item skipping for pruning search space and increase of mining speed, and techniques of subset-checking which are combination of two methods of  Two-level hash-indexed result tree for dense databases, and  Pseudo-projection based upward checking for sparse databases in order to decrease the closure calculation cost.

Closet+ is generally an appropriate algorithm compared with other closed item mining algorithms, and it runs with less time and memory due to employed optimal techniques. Compared with Closet, it also enjoys higher scalability both in database size and the count of single items. In sparse databases, however, it requires large memory.

4) FP-Close Algorithm: In order to conduct mining frequent closed itemsets, FP-Close algorithm mines frequent item from FP-trees. Then, to determine whether the frequent items are closed, it uses frequent closed itemsets tree, CFI-tree, which is a type of FP-tree [2].   A CF-tree is related to a FP-tree Tx , and it is shown as Cx. The tree Cx always stores all found frequent closed itemsets which include x itemset. A newly found frequent itemset y which includes x should be compared with just existing frequent itemsets in  Cx.

If there is no superset of y in  Cx with similar support, then y is closed.

The main idea in FP-close is using FP-array technique. In Closet, Closet+, and FP-Close algorithms, when the initial FP-tree is created from original database, the most important task is traversing FP-trees  and creating conditional FP-trees. A number of different experiments show that 80% of CPU time is devoted to traversal of FP-trees. In FP-close, using FP-array by which a corresponding array with FP-tree is created, traverse is removed from tree, and computation is conducted simply on the corresponding array. Hence, in most cases, FP-close has better performance than Closet+. When the time consumed for creating corresponding array from FP-tree is more than FP-tree traversal,  Closet+ performance is better than FP-Close.

Such case  occurs in databases with numerous items.

Like Close and Closet+, FP-Close requires large memory in sparse databases.

5) DCI-Closed Algorithm: DCI-Closed is another algorithm for mining frequent closed itemsets. This algorithm uses a depth-first-search method in search space, and uses a vertical format[4].

Since detecting the duplicate closed items, i.e. items that have been formerly generated, is a critical issue in increasing the performance in mining the frequent closed itemsets, this algorithm suggests a general technique for quick detection and removal of duplicate closed items. This is an optimal technique from memory point of view as unlike formerly discussed algorithms, it does not need to keep all closed itemsets that have been mined so far. It detects the duplicate closed itemsets in another way.

In this algorithm a term ,i.e. equivalence classes in introduced. Two itemsets belong to the same class equivalence if and only if they have the same closure.

Some algorithms such as A-close choose minimum elements or key patterns of each equivalence class as closure generators. The key patterns form a lattice, and this lattice can be easily traversed by a simple algorithm like Apriori [1]. But an equivalence class can have more than one minimum element, and still leads to similar closed itemsets. Other algorithms use another technique called closure climbing. Once a generator is determined, its closure is calculated. The new generators are formed as recently discovered closed itemsets supersets. As the closed itemsets are maximal elements of their own class, this strategy always guarantees to jump from an equivalence class to another. However, it does not guarantee that a new generator belongs to an equivalence class which has not been visited yet.

Hence, regardless of the strategy adopted, needed to use some duplicate checking  technique in order to avoid generating multiple times the same closed itemsets. It is not favored, like former algorithms, to keep all mined closed items in the memory and compare them with the new ones, as it requires much space and time. DCI-Closed uses a specific check on frequent itemsets in the algorithm that is used for detecting unique generators of each equivalence class to achieve all closed itemsets whose closure minimum is       required. This algorithm extracts a relation of total lexicographic order ?    among all search space itemsets and does not calculate closure of generators which are not matched with order preserving for preventing duplicate closed itemsets. DCI-Closed performs mining all frequent closed itemsets by 3 sets that name Closed-set, Pre-set, and post-set[4].



IV. . Classifying and comparing frequent closed itemsets  A. Classifying different frequent closed itemsets As noted in different classes of  frequent closed  itemsets mining algorithms, they can be categorized as following:    1) Type of Search Strategy: In the first classification, introduced in section 3, the closed itemsets mining algorithms are classified in two classes according to their search strategy. The first class use breadth-first-search strategy, and the second class employ depth-first-search strategy for mining operation.

The experiments imply that the latter are more successful.

2) Type of  Data Format: The algorithms use two vertical and horizontal formats for mining process.

Generally there is no straightforward position to decide which class is better.

3) Type of Generator Selection: Some algorithms choose minimum elements of each equivalence class as closure generators. In other algorithms that use closure climbing method. Therefore, closed itemsets mining algorithms can be divided in two classes; minimum elements method, and closure climbing method.

Algorithms that use of with closure climbing method have better performance, as in these algorithms generators are recursively formed from closed itemsets, and they are probably larger than other class generators including minimum elements. A larger generator requires less check to determine its closure, and therefore algorithms based on closure climbing method are more efficient.

4)  Type of Closure Calculation: Generators' closure calculation can be done both on-line and off-line. In the former case, the closure is calculated once a frequent generator is formed, whereas in the latter closure is calculated after all frequent generators are calculated.

Hence, frequent closed itemsets mining algorithms are put in two classes, i.e. "on-line" and "off-line". The latter consider minimum elements strategy as the type of generator selection, while the former usually use the closure climbing method. Therefore, algorithms with  on-line method are usually more successful than off- line ones.  Table1 shows the algorithms' classification.

B. Comparison of frequent Closed Itemsets Mining Algorithms  This section compares introduced algorithms for their performance. The first algorithm was A-close.

Table1. Classification of frequent Closed Itemsets mining Algorithms  A-close has much considerable time. The main reason lies in the fact that it uses breath-first-search method in which for each level the database is read. In other words, the main problem of A-close is the high number of passes of database. Therefore, it requires much more time especially when the databases is large or min-support is low. Charm is the first algorithm that uses vertical format for mining process. It has higher performance compared with other previous algorithms.

Closet is another algorithm for frequent closed itemsets mining that employs FP-tree structure to narrow the database mining to FP-tree mining. In this algorithm, some optimizations are proposed to enhance time and memory. Its main drawback, however, is that it requires large memory in sparse databases. Comparing Charm and Closet, it is noted that the former is mostly faster than the latter in dense databases, except when the minimum support is high. Closet+ is the developed version of Close that tries to remove Close drawback using two different structures for sparse and dense databases. This algorithm proves to have great performance with the help of existing strategies and some new optimization technique. Still it has some weak point in sparse databases as it needs large memory. Compared with Charm, Closet+ has smaller consumption memory and higher scalability. In execution time there are some variations. Sometimes Closet+ works better, and sometimes Charm. FP-close algorithm also uses FP-tree structure like Closet and Closet+. It decreases tree's traversal time using a new technique termed FP-array. Therefore, in most cases it needs less time compared with previous algorithms.

DCI-Closed algorithm which is introduced as the best and last closed itemsets mining algorithm uses various  Type of Closure  Calculation  Type of Generator Selection  Type of Data Format  Type of  Search Strategy  Algorithm  off-line minimumelements horizontal breadth-  first-search A-close  on-line closure climbing vertical depth-  first-search Charm  on-line closure climbing horizontal depth-  first-search Closet  on-line closure climbing horizontal depth-  first-search Closet+  on-line closure climbing horizontal depth-  first-search FP-Close  on-line closure climbing vertical depth-  first-search DCI-  Closed       innovative optimizations in itemsets closure calculations and their support. Furthermore, employing an optimal technique in time and memory, it quickly detects and removes duplicate closed itemsets. This algorithm excels in time and memory all other algorithms in almost all situations.



V. Experimental Evaluation Due to high number of discussed algorithms for  frequent closed itemsets mining, just performance results of the best algorithms ,i.e.  Closet+, FP-close, and DCI-Closed are shown. These results have been tested on databases Chess, Retail and  Pumsb*. Chess and  Pumsb* are dense databases and Retail is among sparse databases.

Figure 2,3, and 4 illustrate of the results of execution of  DCI-Closed, FP-Close, and  Closet+ on databases Chess, Retail ,and Pumsb* respectively.

In figures 2 and 4, the execution time of algorithm FP-Close is better than Closet+. But in figure 3, Closet+ works better than FP-Close. It is due to the fact that in Retail  database the number of frequent items is high, and therefore the time given for formation of corresponding array from related FP-tree is high, whereas FP-tree traversal with optimized strategies employed in Closet+ consumes substantially less time.



VI. Conclusion A significant method of condensed representation  involves using frequent closed itemsets as their number is fewer than frequent itemsets. The frequent closed itemsets are as powerful as all frequent itemsets, and they increase the effect of mining through removing redundant rules. In recent years, due to the importance of frequent closed itemsets mining many algorithms have been introduced which use various strategies. In this study, the most popular algorithms of frequent closed itemsets  mining have been analyzed. The experiments show that each algorithm has its own advantages and disadvantages regarding its use in different sparse and dense databases. Among them, however, DCI-Close algorithm has higher performance due to various innovative optimizations in closure calculations of itemsets, preventing generation of duplicate closed itemsets, and no extra closure operation.
