I. INTRODUCTION  Since the 90s of last century, along with the breakthroughs of networking, communications and information technology, Internet explosive growth in the global and rapidly spread, in this context, the financial network also came into being.

The so-called network of finance, also known as e-finance, refers to achieve financial activities on the Internet, including the network of financial institutions, Internet financial transactions, networks financial markets, financial regulation and so on. It differs from the traditional physical form of existence financial activities, the existence is electronic space, their existence is a form of virtualization and the operating mode is a network-based. Online financial services Web site created precisely in response to an e-commerce trend.

Online financial Web site as a whole system is divided into system platform and application systems at two levels, which system platform including network, computer and system software, application system is dealing with business logic.

Within this overall architecture, the application systems were divided into channel layer, the core business layer and the agency business gateway layer. Channel layer provides mobile phone short message, wap, web and telephone service centers and many other financial services channels; the core business layer provides financial information services and financial transaction services; agency business gateway layer provides  This research is supported by National Funds of Social Science under Grant 08CJY058.

Significance of the existence E-finance industry's value? added business should be achieved through electronic financial services. However, two problems can not avoid are staged from time to time behind the Chinese online financial Web site: First, such a large investment to achieve electronic information in banks, then why banks line up everywhere? Second, such a big investment in many security measures, strengthen the network of banks all the necessary facilities, and within two years from 2008 to the present, the number of e-banking accounts rose 100 times, while there are 80% of the personal e-bank account was frozen like or basic precipitation?

At present, China Bank's business processes based on internal management and internal accounting needs, lack of scientific customer segmentation and target customer location.

Place a long time philosophy around the "capital-centered" thinking not the "customer-centered", What we see is the face of the wave of the impact of information technology, financial services variety of new services marketing activities have been continuously developed and attract customers eye-intensive; we do not see is that a waste of resources and ineffective use of information behind the eye, and the heavy capital expenditure and ongoing maintenance costs remains high. Therefore, the real concerns to growth customers to the bank lead to continued profitable, tap the effective conduct of their information and give a very specific service is a realistic choice sustainable development for an online financial website.



II. INFORMATION MINING TECHNOLOGY AND ASSOCIATION RULE  Network information problem have a very important and far-reaching impact both for public utilities or private company's strategic planning. General, the network shortest path between any two points is defined as the length of the distance between two points. If a point on the network to the rest of the maximum distance from the point of the smallest, then the point is known as the center, if the point to the rest of points and the minimum distance, the point is known as the median (center). In this paper we focus on median problem. If the problem is to strive for in the n-point networks to find k points, making it a point to the rest of the k-point distance and    minimum, this problem is well-known as k-center (k-median) median problem; it has proven the problem is NP-hard.

Mettu and Plaxton established and studied the online median location issues in 2003. The output of their model is a sequence to be located and to ensure that each k-sequence of pre-order the costs all with the corresponding k-median problem close to the optimal solution cost. Specific performance metrics is to use competitive ratio algorithms to measure, the competitive ratio as small as possible. Since the model is proposed, it is subjected to the attention of a growing number of management scientists, operations research and computer scientists, but little further research. Article in the Mettu and Plaxton, they proved that a metric space is busy central location problem the lower bound of competitive ratio  2 __ 2 _ is n - 1 , where n is the number of points, which is now the best known lower bound results.

Information is the basis for mining customers, customer information management problems is how to get large amounts of data they need from the information, especially the information policy makers they need, data mining technology is currently more popular theories. For the data mining (DM, data mining), a more accepted definition of W.JFrawley, G.Piatetsky-Shapiro and others made: the data mining is the data from large databases to extract interest knowledge. This knowledge is implicit, potentially useful information to extract the performance of the concept of knowledge (concepts), rules (rules), rules (regularities), pattern (patterns) and other forms.

The more general argument is: Data mining means find patterns in the decision support process that in some of the facts or a collection of observation data. It is a mass data using a variety of tools found in the relationship between model and data process.

People's data applications laid from low-level the query to provide support for the decision-making in information mining technology. Many mining nature problem can be translated into equivalent classification. Classification, clustering, forecasting, correlation analysis is for the completion of different tasks at different levels and developed by means of technical applications. Classification can be described as follows: a large number of samples constitute the input data set, that is, the training set. Each sample has several attributes, including attributes and can be a continuous attribute, it can be discrete attributes. There is a property known as the class attribute is used to indicate the sample belong classification.

Correlation data exist in the database is an important knowledge that can be identified, the purpose of association analysis is to identify hidden off the database closed network , which can help enterprises understand the linkages between customers to buy goods, then select the appropriate marketing strategy.

The basic concepts of association rules as follows:  se/ = (ip ... in) is a collection of items. D is a collection of database transactions, where each transaction T is a collection of items, making T C I . A set is a collection of items, if   A ? T ,so that means T contains A . An association rule is one of the form A implies B Chong-style, where A ? I , B ? I and A (I B = 0 . Each association rule includes two important features, namely, support and confidence. The support describes the use of association rules; confidence describes the reliability of association rules.

Association rules can be found in a variety of association rules from a lot of customer data to help the online financial Web site customer segmentation, cross-service, etc. The rule in the information mining get growing, this is because the real characteristics of economic activity determined. Today, with the rising frequency of commercial activities also full of personal expression, unexpected choices and unpredictable factors also get growth at the same time. First, all of these groups there is no fixed pattern of thinking; stress is placed on a variety of factors to meet the immediate feelings of mixed level; individual choice, while full of contradictions on the available options, were unable to clarify the path of thinking.

Any associated factors that could cause such customers do not have the choice of high-quality follow-up of sexual behavior.



III. GROWTH CUSTOMER CHARACTERISTICS OF INFORMATION AND BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS  Today, the study of the customer profit contributions are two factions: the causes school and results school. The causes school major research contribution to customer profitability formation mechanism and influencing factors; and the results school is based on historical trading data to evaluate the customer profit contribution. The causes school study focused on a number of non-financial indicators of the impact of customer profit contribution, such as customer satisfaction on financial performance; the results school of the customer profit contribution laid in the research performance model for the customer profit contribution. Berger, and Nash had a series of customer profitability model to calculate the specific circumstances of the customer profit contribution, but the authors did not provide these customers profit contribution model of empirical analysis. Mulhem proposed a model for calculating a customer's current profit contribution, this model is designed for direct sales, in the calculation of customer profitability degrees, considered only the direct marketing costs. Wayland and Cole summed up the customer profit contribution calculation methods; take the former a degree of customer profitability as a customer basis for next profit contribution. In the relationship marketing and customer relationship management, a common practice that all current projections have not yet achieved the lifetime value of customers and in accordance with the value of the size of the sort for each plan period, according to resource-constrained businesses as large as possible to customers as an enterprise focus on the examination object as much as possible the value of choice, using this approach, enterprises can ensure the maximization of future profits. Rakesh and Gupta proposed the calculation of real-life customer profit contribution model.

While Yang Yong-heng proposed a concept of formula to predict the potential customer profit contribution.

The above scholars mainly aimed at real-life customer profit contribution made a number of calculation models and formulas, but little studied growing customer recognition and retention provide an important basis for decision making to be able to maintain a lasting strategy for enterprise customers.

Growth customer has been continued to tap the available capacity of profits, and the different levels of the group demonstrated an overall expansion trend in a long period of time, future development is expected. Measure customer growth behavior is a very complicated and difficult matter, not only because it needs time and space, quality and quantity to examine, the more difficult is that customer growth is a highly integrated and dynamic concept of development that can not be unified approach and a single indicator to measure. We can measure the client's growth benefit from business growth of GEP examine ways.

The basic principle of GEP is to determine the status of each index value and the standard score, based on the assessment of the first measurement period of one year before the online customer, the average value of each index and to determine the average score. Study clients the reality of the situation in the past (before the evaluation period 1 year), and then an index measuring customer class comparison score the real value of the indicator based on customer evaluation period; Study the target customers in the same class (or all) position, thus re-calculate the target customer (the whole) to compare scores with the former an average score ratio; study the index clients measurement throughout the period, the growth of the state, and finally the ratio sum of each index reached a comprehensive growth index, reflecting the overall growth of the financial status of customers.

In this paper, we choose customer transaction records and background information as raw data, in its pre-process operations based on the expert knowledge and experience in the field, through the statistical analysis of customer transactions generated can be used to describe the behavior patterns of the original features of groups, these primitive features customer trading patterns of behavior should be inherent in the essence of the important properties. The growth is no doubt that such acts customers showed steady growth in the statistical sense, the performance of its data path for the upward divergence.



IV. GROWING CUSTOMER DATA MINING AND CORRELA nON MODELS  Using GEP method, usually the customer growth is set to quantitative indicator system A (A system) and qualitative indicators of the system B (B system). A systematic evaluation model study the customer growth from a quantitative perspective whether the growth has economic sense, we must continuously examine its dynamic state of development. Thus, A systematic evaluation model judged by two-dimensional evaluation method, that is space and time, at the same time examine a continuous period of time in which the position and rate of growth and quality. The specific method is: first determine the overall situation of groups of customers are located, and then calculate a number of years before the   evaluation period (typically 3 years) growth conditions (including changes in customer class status and changes in customer's own state), the final evaluation period the actual level of the growth of the previous status of a number of years and then compare the final evaluation period as a whole to reflect the growth status of clients.

If we inspected a customer in the A system, then the client index value of the actual scores and the average score values  of P Ai and PAt in the evaluation period are:  PAi = Did + (ZiS -Zid) /(Zig -Zid) X (Dig -Did)  PAt = Dtd + (Ztm -Ztd) /(Ztg -Ztd) x (Dtg -Dtd) ;  PAi : Customers index value actual scores a number of  years before evaluation period; PAt: Customers average index  score value a number of years before evaluation period; Zis : customers actual value of indicators in the evaluation period;  Zid: customers actual value of indicators where the lower  Z.

range of values in the evaluation period; 19 : customers actual value of indicators where the maximum range value in the  evaluation period; Did: customers lower values correspond to  D.

the standard index score in the evaluation period; 19: customers maximum index value of the corresponding standard score in the evaluation period; Other values are the average evaluation indicators of the corresponding period.

Taking into account the client's perception changes, then the above equation can be deformed as follows with the introduction of Cognitive Theory on the proliferation-related cognitive theory:  pn = n?l X dN(t) . pn = n?l X ? dN(t) Ai P Ai d(t) , At PAt f:t d(t) .

Based on the analysis of the cognitive information behavior,  behavioral model of the proliferation of quantitative research is as follows:  dN(t) = p(m-N(t))+ q  N(t) (m-N(t)) d(t) m , Among them,  P is the coefficient adoption of direct behavior  (O<p<l)q .  h . . .. ffi? - - ; IS t e transmiSSIOn cogmtIve coe IClent ( 0 :0:::; q :0:::; 1) . m is the final adoption of the biggest acts of  the number of possibilities.

N(t)  is a cumulative number people to adopt cognitive behavior.

Therefore, we can calculate and evaluate the actual scores  and the average score values PAi values  PAt a number of years before the target period, to calculate the customer evaluation    period D Ai actual scores and average scores  D At according to the weight of individual indicators,  n dN(t) n-I dN(t) DAi = PAi X --- ;DAt = PAt X I---? dp t?l dp  dN(t) mte-(p+q)t[l + qe-(p+q)t / p] dp [1 + qe-(p+q)t / p]2  m[l-e- ( p + q )t][(qe-  (p + q)t / p2)+ qte-(p+q)t / p] + ??---??-??????---?  [1 + qe -(p+q)t / p]2  me-(p + q)t[t + (qt / p) + q(l-e-(p+q)t) / p]  = > 0 [1 + qe-(p+q)t / p]2  B system is the indicator described qualitative indicators, measurement whether the amount of customer growth from the qualitative point of view, we must examine the most important impact of customer growth in cognitive, interpersonal relationships and behavior patterns of internal and external environmental factors, while ensuring that participating in the evaluation targets can be established between the organic link, reflecting the perception of the main characteristics of customers.

In order to find meaningful association rules, we need to set two thresholds: minimum support and minimum confidence.

The former association rules under which the user degree of support must meet the minimum, it is that a group of objects set in the statistical sense of the need to meet the minimum level; the latter, the user-defined association rules must satisfy the minimum credibility, it reflects the minimum reliability of association rules. Taking into account the online financial Web site placing our clients into different customers with the size of the assets of, our clustering method used here to determine the actual index scores and adjacent changes in the relevance of different clients.

The basic steps of Clustering fusion algorithm of are as follows:  Step 1: for a given n mode Xi , the first of each model as a  kind Wi = (Xi) set the number of clusters C = n . , ,  Step 2: When C ?: 1 , repeat the following steps 3 through 5; Step 3: using a suitable similarity metric scales and rules to  determine the most similar to two clustering Wi and Wj ;  W w .  w.. = (w.,w .)  Step 4: Merge i and J, lj I J ,  in order to get a  number of categories for the C -1 of the clustering solution;  Step 5: C values decrease.

In the clustering process, we must select the appropriate measure of similarity scale and connectivity rules based on characteristics of the data distribution and mode, and rules   according to different scales of clustering will produce different clustering results. In this paper, Euclidean norm and Ward method are used as clustering of specific criteria.



V. THE PROCESS OF GROWING CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION  For the online financial Web site owned by the customer name, customer account and other indicator, we form a feature vector with the optimal behavior patterns described in customer transactions. These models will be presented to the established pattern recognition classifier that is associated with the use of established decision-making on the pattern classification to generate a different pattern class. Carried out a relatively fixed pattern of behavior of their ideas in accordance with the normal customer transactions generally, with similar identity of the customer should have a similar and consistent with its status, so behavior patterns of transactions have similarity transactions of similar behavior patterns of customers.

Obtained through the clustering algorithm pattern class representing the different types of customer transactions behavioral patterns of transactions with similar characteristics, if the same pattern class in a customer has with the class of the other clients similar to identity, then the view that the Client trading activity is a normal trading patterns; otherwise, then that the client transactions deviating from normal patterns are unusual trading patterns, consider the appropriate level of attention to the degree.

Through the use of pattern recognition technology to customer transactions to identify behavior patterns, analysis and monitoring, in order to effectively discover customer growth. Identification process is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Customer Growth Chart Pattern Recognition  Customer original transaction records  Customer behavior patterns A  Growth cllstomer  General cllstomer  Accordance with the "branch and bound" algorithm for selection of these original features to form a lower dimension of the optimal and most efficient characteristics of groups, each client are based on the optimal feature vector to describe their trading behavior. After searching, we can assume the average daily transaction value (D 1), the average monthly trading frequency (D2) and the average monthly frequency of cash transactions (D3) formed combination of growth characteristics of customer behavior patterns as the optimal characteristics of groups.



VI. CONCLUSIONS AND ANALYSIS  This Paper use information identification technology associated with the field of online financial Web site clients to identify online trading and analysis through customer behavior patterns, to identify null and void customers the frequency of deviation from the normal behavior of network transactions, and vice versa is our growth customers are looking for.

Theoretical analysis shows that the financial sector application of this method can effectively identify transaction patterns of behavior consistent with their status of growing client. For the feature selection problem, "branch and bound" algorithm can guarantee the optimal combination of features, but the computing cost a relatively large amount. In the recognition process associated with the use of information from the bottom-up fusion algorithm, we can avoid the recognition process of the user-defined parameters, sensitivity and dependence to improve the recognition of non-supervisory.

The associated recognition technology has some significance for monitoring growth of the unusual nature of customer transactions to identify unusual trading patterns of behavior with the non-growing client or invalid client.
