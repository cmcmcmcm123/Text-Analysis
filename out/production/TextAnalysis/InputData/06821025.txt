I.  INTRODUCTION Facing increasingly fierce global competition, it is crucial  for make-to-order labor-intensive manufacturing to improve information visibility and transparency as well as the decision- making performance in supply chain  operations [1].

Some companies implemented various information systems to increase information visibility and transparency in distributed manufacturing environments. It is well known that the radio frequency identification (RFID) technology can enhance information visibility and traceability in supply chain [2]. In recent years, as the application of RFID technology has become economically feasible in labor-intensive manufacturing industry, some RFID-based information systems have been developed to collect accurate production data and track production progress real-timely, and their effectiveness has been proved by various industrial applications and practices.

However, the existing data capture and tracking systems are designed for a separate plant. Nowadays, China?s labor- intensive companies in global manufacturing usually produce production orders in multiple subordinate and collaborative plants located in different regions. To track production in all plants effectively, some companies develop additional systems to integrate production data from different plants and save these data into a central database located at the headquarters.

However, it is technologically complicated to synchronize the database located in different regions real-timely, and it also needs extra costs for secondary development and maintenance.

It is thus necessary to develop an effective system to track and monitor the production progress in a distributed production manufacturing involving multiple production plants located in different regions. In recent years, cloud-based systems and applications have emerged as an important trend in information  technology, which have been applied successfully in various organizations from government [3], manufacturing [4], healthcare [5] and education [6] sectors. However, cloud-based application in production tracking, and production decision- making has not been reported in labor-intensive manufacturing industries so far.

Existing data capture systems installed in each plant can collect a huge number of real-time production data from production frontlines in labor-intensive manufacturing.

However, these abundant data collected are mainly utilized for payroll recording and simple production reporting. There exists difficulty for production management to use these collected data to make effective production scheduling decisions.

Today?s labor-intensive manufacturing is characterized by short lead-time, short life-cycle, volatile customer demands, and distributed multi-plant production environment. These characteristics increase the complexity of the production scheduling problem existing in the global labor-intensive manufacturing environment [7]. For these complex problems, traditional approaches, such as simulation, mathematical programming and heuristic methods, cannot provide effective scheduling solutions. In recent years, intelligent optimization algorithms have been more and more widely used in handling scheduling problems because they have the potential of seeking the global optimum [8]. However, no research has examined the production scheduling problems in a distributed manufacturing company from a holistic perspective.

This paper will address the production tracking and scheduling problem faced by a distributed labor-intensive manufacturing company. A cloud-based intelligent tracking and scheduling system (CITSS) will be developed, in which cloud and RFID technologies are integrated for remote and real-time production data capture and tracking while intelligent techniques are used to generate effective production scheduling solutions.



II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION The production tasks of this type of companies in global  manufacturing are completed in m  production plants, including self-owned or collaborative plants, located in different regions. These plants involve N  production departments numbered as 1 to N . These production departments can be classified into two categories: ordinary category and special category. Each category involves multiple   DOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.54    DOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.54       production departments. The departments of ordinary category are fully contained in all plants but it is possible that those of special category are only partly included (or not included) in some plants. Each department consists of multiple shop floors while each shop floor consists of multiple workstations or multiple assembly lines consisting of workstations. Each workstation is usually a physical location that accommodates an operator, a machine and a buffer. Fig. 1 shows the structure of the manufacturing company and the flowchart of production task allocation after receiving customer orders. In this figure, PDmn denotes the nth production department of plant m, SFmnp denotes the pth shop floor of PDmn.

Fig. 1. Flowchart of production task allocation after receiving orders    The manufacturing company receives various production orders from different customers. Each group of production orders with the same due date from a same customer are called as an order group. After customer orders of an order group are confirmed, the manufacturer needs to purchase raw materials from material suppliers according to the materials requirement of customer orders. Labor-intensive manufacturing industries such as apparel and footwear are usually characterized by quick response manufacturing. It is very important to obtain raw materials in a timely manner. It is thus crucial to track the materials? production so as to effectively monitor and control their production progress in suppliers? plants. Moreover, to enhance production visibility, all production processes of customer orders need to be tracked and monitored effectively.

Especially, manual operations have large effects on production performance in labor-intensive manufacturing, which are prone to being production bottleneck. Thus, production in workstations with key manual operations need to be tracked.

Production management at different management levels have different tracking requirements according to their responsibilities. For example, production management at the head company need to track and oversee all orders while shop managers only need to track the orders in their shop floors.

In a distributed labor-intensive environment with multiple plants, the purpose of production scheduling is to assign various production orders to appropriate shop floors or  assembly lines of m  production plants for production.  Each order consists of a maximum of N  production processes, which need to be performed in production departments 1 to N , respectively. That is, production process i  can only be produced in production department i  ( Ni ,...,1= ). Each production process of an order is assigned to only one plant for processing, which indicates that it is possible that different production processes of an order need to be performed in different plants. In real-world production practice, scheduling tasks are performed by production management at different management levels, respectively, so as to assign production tasks to appropriate production units. Some important real- world problem features in production scheduling of labor- intensive manufacturing need to be considered, including multiple scheduling objectives and various uncertainties.

The problem addressed aims at tracking and monitoring each order?s production progress accurately from material production to packing process in a real-time manner and determining where and when each production process of each order needs to be produced based on real-time data.



III. CLOUD-BASED INTELLIGENT TRACKING AND SCHEDULING SYSTEM  A. System architecture Fig. 2 shows the architecture of the CITSS. RFID  technology is used to collected production data from distributed manufacturing environments on a real-time basis while intelligent optimization techniques are used to make scheduling decisions. This architecture involves an RFID- based production data capture (RPDC) model, a data capture middleware, a real-time production database, a data analysis and processing (DAP) model, a production decision-making database, a cloud-based real-time production tracking (CRPT) model and a remote intelligent production scheduling (RIPS) model. Except for the RPDC model running in distributed plants, other models are all run remotely in the servers located at the company?s headquarters. This architecture is thus a cloud-based system architecture. Further speaking, this architecture fits in the concept of community cloud.

The RPDC model is in charge of collecting real-time production records, from each workstation in all plants based on RFID technology. These production records collected are transferred to the remote data capture middleware, which is in charge of receiving the data from the RPDC model, entering the production data into the real-time production database and providing access to the data. The real-time production database stores production data by using MySQL, MS SQL Server, or Oracle according to specific data processing requirements.

Based on the data collected, the DAP model analyzes and preprocesses these data, extracts necessary summary data and then save them into the production decision-making database.

Based on the data collected, the CRPT model is developed to track and monitor the production progress of each production order in plants. The RISD model is developed to generate effective scheduling decisions based on intelligent optimization techniques. These models provide user-friendly interfaces to remotely interact with users from different production units       based on web technologies. The following subsections describe four key models of the CITSS.

Fig. 2. CITSS architecture for production tracking and scheduling  B. RFID-based production data capture (RPDC) model The RPDC model is composed of submodels installed in  each plant. Fig. 3 shows the structure of an RPDC submodel installed in a shop floor or an assembly line. Each shop floor or assembly line uses the same way to collect production records.

In each workstation, an RFID terminal is installed, which reads the RFID tag attached to each workpiece to capture the starting time and the end time of each workpiece being processed on this workstation. The RFID terminals in each submodel are integrated into an intranet by the switch. The switch is a device that channels incoming data from any of the multiple input ports to the specified output port that takes the data toward its intended destination, which is connected with a data capture middleware. The data communication between the switch and the middleware uses the TCP/IP protocol.

The RFID tags used in this model are passive RFID tags with the low frequency of 125 KHZ, which are low cost and technically mature for industrial use. Only the tag ID is stored in the memory of the tag. Other information related to the RFID tags is stored in the remote real-time production database. Each tag ID is mapped with the additional information of the tag through the real-time production database.

Except for the data collected by the RFID terminals, some information, including the given data of production orders, shop floors, assembly lines, workstations and operators, are also input directly by computer operators from each shop floor through a web-based program imbedded into the RPDC model.

The program provides the computer operator an user-friendly interface to input related production information.

Fig. 3. Structure of RPDC submodel installed in a shop floor or assembly line    C. Data analysis and processing model  The amount of real-time production data collected from production frontline is huge. Although a huge number of real- time production records are collected, only these raw data are insufficient to implement production tracking and making production decisions. The DAP model is thus developed to extract necessary parameters from the real-time production database and placed them into the production decision-making database according to specific tracking and scheduling requirements. The necessary parameters are used in CRPT and RISD models, which include: (1) the operator and machine configuration of each production unit; (2) the information of each order, including operations involved in this order and each operation?s standard allowed minute (SAM); (3) daily working records of each operator.

D. Cloud-based real-time production tracking (CRPT) model Production management at different management levels,  including company, plant and shop levels, need to track and monitor the production progress of customer orders timely and accurately according to their job responsibilities. The CRPT model is thus designed and developed by integrating production tracking functions at 3 different levels, namely company level, plant level and shop floor level.

Fig. 4 shows the structure of the CRPT model. This model is actually a web-based production monitoring program, which connects with the remote production decision-making database and provides a user friendly web portal to help production management  to track and monitor each order?s production progress. The web portal gives production management at different levels easy access to the information consistent with their job requirements. The users at each management level can browse information related to his/her job responsibility by web browsers in microcomputers and mobile phones with Internet connections according to their access rights.

Fig. 4. Structure of the CRPT model    E. Remote intelligent production scheduling model An intelligent technique-based scheduling mechanism is  presented to handle production scheduling tasks at different management levels from a holistic perspective. Production management at different levels need to determine how to assign orders to appropriate production units and the processing sequences of these orders in these production units.

Fig. 5 shows the flowchart of the RIPS model for a distributed labor-intensive manufacturing environment involving multiple plants. The scheduling mechanism in this model implements production scheduling task in the distributed environment by decomposing the scheduling task into 3 order scheduling problems at the following 3 management levels:     Fig. 5. Flowchart of the RIPS model  (1) Company level: After new production orders from a customer is confirmed,  the order scheduling submodel at company level determines how to assign each production order from customers to an appropriate plant.

(2) Plant level: After production order assigned by the head company are confirmed, the order scheduling submodel at the plant level decides how to assign each order from the head company to one or more appropriate shop floors in this plant.

(3) Shop level: The scheduling submodel at this level decides how to schedule the production of orders in a shop floor. In some production environments such as sewing, each shop floor consists of multiple assembly lines. In this case, it is necessary to decide how to assign orders to each assembly line.

Production orders are assigned for production according to the scheduling solutions generated. After a group of orders from a customer is produced, the finished products are finally delivered to the destinations specified by the customer. In addition, users at different management levels can access these scheduling submodels through Internet connections.

Scheduling solutions at each management level are saved into the production decision-making database on a real-time basis, and used as input parameters of scheduling and decision- making processes at lower management level so that more transparent and timely information sharing can be achieved.

In real-world production practice, the three scheduling problems at different levels need to consider various labor- intensive production features, such as multiple plants, multiple shop floors, multiple orders, multiple production objectives and production uncertainties. These features make these problems become complex uncertain multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems, for which traditional optimization techniques cannot provide optimal or near-optimal solutions.

The first author has proposed a hybrid intelligent decision- making model to solve an order allocation problem with the consideration of multiple objectives production uncertainties [9]. In this model, various production uncertainties, such as uncertain order arrival time and uncertain processing time, are described by random variables, multi-objective intelligent optimization and Monte Carlo simulation techniques are integrated to generate Pareto optimal solutions.  The optimum- seeking process of the hybrid intelligent model can be utilized to handle production scheduling problems at different levels.

The main procedures involved in this optimum-seeking process can be described briefly as follows:  (1) A multi-objective intelligent optimization submodel is adopted firstly to generate the initial Pareto optimal solutions to the deterministic production scheduling problem. The deterministic problem does not consider production uncertainty by assuming that all uncertain orders need to be produced and the processing time of an order in a production department equals the mean of its processing time in this department.

(2) To tackle the stochastic production scheduling problem, the Monte Carlo simulation submodel is then employed to evaluate performance (fitness) of each initial Pareto optimal solution under various uncertainties in production scheduling.

(3) Based on the fitness of initial solutions for the stochastic problem, the heuristic pruning submodel is finally used to generate the final optimal solutions for  production practice.



IV. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION  A. System Development and Implementation To evaluate the effectiveness of the CITSS architecture  proposed in section III, a pilot system was developed and a distributed apparel manufacturing company with multiple plants was selected as the pilot company to evaluate this system. The  pilot manufacturing company has 4 production plants located in 4 different cities, which receives production orders from its global customers and produces these order in its 4 plants according to customers? requirements.  These plants include 5 types of production departments, including cutting, silk-screen, sewing, finishing and packaging. Each production department includes one or more shop floors. Each sewing shop floor consists of multiple assembly lines while other shop floor consists of multiple workstations. In each plant, different production departments are included.

The pilot system contains the functions of remote production tracking and production scheduling at company level. In the pilot manufacturing company,  one shop floor in each production department of each plant was selected out to implement and test the pilot system.

In apparel manufacturing, sewing production has the largest effects on production performance of each plant. An RFID terminal is thus installed in each sewing workstation in sewing assembly lines to capture the production records of each sewing operations. In cutting department, RFID terminals are installed in each cutting workstation to capture the output of cutting pieces from each cutting bed. In silk-screen department, each bundle of garments is collected while the production record of each piece of garment is collected in finishing department. In packing department, RFID terminals collect the records of each carton of garments. In addition, three RFID terminals are installed in a fabric supplier?s shop floors to track the production progress of main fabric materials.

The pilot system was developed on the basis of Java/J2EE, SQL Server 2005 and web technologies. The production management at different levels can track the production progress of each order by some summarized reports, and also assign each order to an appropriate plant. Some examples of interfaces of the pilot system are shown in Fig.s 6-8.

Fig. 6 shows an interface illustrating the comparison of production efficiency and progress for different operations? in a production unit. By this interface, one can compare the average efficiency and progress of different operations of a production order being processed in a plant, a production department, a shop floor or an assembly line. It can be clearly found if the production flow of an order is smooth in a production unit. One can also compare the actual operating time of each operation with its SAM value by this interface. For example, the average operating time of operation ?001? and its SAM value is 20 and 22 seconds respectively. This interface can be used by production management at different levels to track each order?s production detail.

Fig. 6. Interface 1 ? Production detail of operations in an order    Fig. 7. Interface 2 ? Production detail of orders in an order group    Fig. 7 shows an interface illustrating the comparison of production progress of all orders in an order group, which is designed for production management at plant and company levels to track each order and each order group?s production progress. As shown in this figure, the order group ?NKE- SP01B1? consists of 21 orders. On the whole, 55% total workload of this order group has been completed. 89% workload of order 2 has been completed while only 18% workload of order 9 was completed. By this interface, one can compare the production progress and average operating time for each product of different orders in an order group.

Fig. 8 shows the interface of showing the solution of assigning production orders to different plants, which is the result of production scheduling at company level. As shown in this figure, the orders of order group ?NIT-WI12-2B? are assigned to plant 2 while the orders of order group ?OKY- SP13-1S? are assigned to plant 1 for processing. Each production order can only be assigned to one plant for       production due to its small-batch feature. In addition, the sequence of orders shown in the table represents their sequence to be produced in the corresponding plant.

Fig. 8. Interface 3 ? remote intelligent scheduling decision-making at company level  B. Evaluation The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is evaluated  by examining the benefits brought by the pilot system. Before the pilot system was developed and implemented in the pilot manufacturing company, production data were collected by manual recordings and the production management could not track the production progress of each order in a real-time and accurate manner. The production schedulers at the headquarters made production scheduling decisions by assigning each order to an appropriate plant based on their experience and subjective judgments, which generated lowly efficient solutions.

After the pilot system was run in the pilot company for more than 6 months, the system performance was analyzed and evaluated by comparing the production performance of latest 3 months and the performance of the same 3 months of last year before the system was implemented. On the basis of the comparison in the two selected periods, the pilot company reported that the following tangible benefits have been achieved:  (1) 8% reduction in labor and system costs: No computer operator is required to input job tickets records now. The pilot system needs less computer servers, less installation and maintenance costs, less IT-related and IE-related manpower.

(2) 25% increase in production efficiency: The real-time and accurate production data collected and effective production scheduling decisions generated by the pilot system can definitely improve production efficiencies.

(3) 12% reduction in production waste: Effective order tracking and monitoring leads to more transparent production process, which has direct effects on reducing overproduction, defects, and in-process inventories. Effective order scheduling decreases the possibility of rush production, which is also helpful to reduce defects.



V. CONCLUSIONS A production tracking and scheduling system was  developed to make effective production tracking and scheduling in a distributed labor-intensive manufacturing environment based on a cloud-based system architecture and 3 different management levels. Due to its cloud-based and easily accessible feature, except for the subordinate plants, real-time production data can also be collected conveniently from supplying and outsourcing plants. These data collected are transferred to remote real-time production database via TCP/IP protocol, and are then analyzed and extracted to be used in production scheduling decision-makings. The intelligent technique-based scheduling mechanism is able to handle production scheduling tasks in distributed labor-intensive manufacturing environments from a holistic perspective.

The effectiveness of the CITSS was validated by the application of a pilot system in a distributed apparel manufacturing company with multiple plants. By implementing this system, better supply chain coordination and better production scheduling decisions can be achieved so as to provide its customers with better services.
