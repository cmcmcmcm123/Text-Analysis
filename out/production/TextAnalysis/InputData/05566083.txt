An Algorithm of Commodities Association Rules  Mining in E-commerce Based on Rough Set

Abstract?E-commerce commodities contain a large number of associated information, an algorithm on how to mine association rules based on rough set is proposed in this paper.

The different feature vectors extracted from different types of commodities can be looked as a prerequisite for getting association rules. By using the knowledge reduction theory the associated commodities can be drown as a minimum set of commodities and we can get the association rules from the set.

We have designed a more efficient algorithm for mining association rules and the algorithm is also described in detail by example.

I. INTRODUCTION The use of association rules to carry out excavation on web  commodities information in electronic commerce can find the user's buying patterns, access mode and visit frequency[1].

Association rules is a trade statistics database in which we can obtain the purchase relation of the commodity A and B and more. The use of mining association rules is to discover this pattern, which can tell merchant how to recommend users some higher correlation commodities, and it can increase sales[2].

Rough set is a new mathematical tool to deal with incomplete and uncertain knowledge, which main feature is that would not require certain characteristics or properties in advance. From the given classification knowledge we can obtain the knowledge reduction and deduce association rules by its indiscernibility relation and classification[3].



II.  ALGORITHM ANALYSIS It is used the positive domain, negative domain and the  domain boundaries to describe the definition extent in rough set. The given problem domain will be divided and determined their support level to certain concept. It includes three support levels: certain support, not support and possible support. In commodities association rules mining, the commodity is defined as property and commodities characteristic is defined as domain elements.

A set of commodities M = (U, T), U is the feature set of non-empty and finite. T is non-empty set of commodities.

Suppose Va is the value of a and a ?T, U?Va is a single map, so any one element of U in the properties of Va is an unique value. If the T include condition attribute set C and decision attribute set D, and C ? D = T, C ? D = ?, that the system S is associated with commodities. While inspecting the association rules, you can choose key objectives of commodities as decision attributes, analyze other commodities dependence to the target commodities, on this basis, the rational proportion of commodities can be distributed[4].

In a set of commodities M = (U, C ? D), the correlation and interest-degree of certain commodities in C are not high, on the conditions of maintaining the same association rules of key commodities, you can delete these redundant commodities. Through the commodities reduction can get minimal and correct association rules. If ind  (B) = ind (B-{a}), B  C, a ?  C, then B is redundant. A set of commodities may exist many reductions, the intersection of these reductions is defined as the core of high relativity and concerns[5].



III.  ALGORITHM REALIZATION Algorithm realization is shown as follows:  (1) The collection of commodities must be divided into commodity set to be associated and target commodity set.

(2) By the use of discernibility matrix and discernibility function can obtain reduction set of commodities.

Discernibility matrix:M (T) = (m (i, j) | n ? n, 1 ? i, j ? n), m (i, j) = (a ? T | a (i) ? a (j) and d (i) ? d (j)), n = | U |[6].

Discernibility function as follows:     ? on behalf of "?", ? on behalf of "?".

(3) Association rules can be derived by the reduction set of commodities. We can get the attribute reduction set and core from the minimal disjunctive of the discernibility function, and the resulting association rules can be deduced.

(4) To retain the rules which certainty factor is 1.

Eleventh Five-Year Planning Project of Jiangxi Province(No.08tw05)  ?= ?? ?  UUj)(i, j)m(i,?  ?     For rule r ij: des (X i) ? des (Y j), Y j ? X i ? ?,  Certainty factor is:  ? (X i, Y j) = | Y j ? X i | / | X i |, 0 <? (X i, Y j) ? 1.

?5?Correlation analysis.

In the rule C1 ? C2 ? C3 ? ... ? Cn => D1 ? D2 ? D3 ? ... ? Dm, the correlation formula is shown as follows:  corr (C1 ? C2 ? ... ? Cn), (D1 ? D2 ? ... ? Dm) =     If corr <1, then the antecedent and consequent are negatively correlated.

If corr> 1, then the antecedent and consequent are positively correlated.

If corr = 1, then the antecedent and consequent are independent of each other.

The association rules can be deleted or retained according to the corr values. For the negative correlation rules, the antecedent and consequent are mutually inverse, and should be deleted. For corr = 1 rules, antecedent and consequent are independent of each other, such rules are also uninteresting. As for the positive correlation rules, the antecedent contains emergence of the consequent, such rules are the higher interest rules.



IV.  EXAMPLE ANALYSIS We use a two-dimensional table shown in table 1 to  describe the commodities set. Domain U is characteristic value of commodities and described as rows. Column property is described as commodities set and target commodity is M 5.

The discernibility matrix is shown in Table 2.

The discernibility matrix can be derived as table 2 according to table 1 .

The discernibility function shown as follows can be derived from table 2.

The commodities association rules shown in table 3 can be derived from the core and target commodities.

V.  CONCLUSION The commodities information is not complete and certain  in web data. The association rules mining techniques based on rough set can deal with such information efficiently. Through data classification and reduction, and restricted by correlation value ? and corr, we can get a higher accuracy commodity association rules set. Under the conditions of strict equivalence relation and professional commodities, rough set algorithm on mining commodities association rules may result in omissions and bias. The algorithm can be combined with other mining algorithms and professional commodities knowledge to eliminate noise data interference, further enhance the accuracy and robustness of the algorithm on commodities association rule mining.
