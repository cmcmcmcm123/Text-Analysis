Visualizing e-Government Portal and Its Performance in WEBVS

Abstract  An e-Government portal is responsible to provide  news, information and services to citizens, merchants  and tourists in a reliable way. Previously, we  proposed a Web Monitoring System (WMS) that  monitors the performance of a web portal in real-  time [1]. Web portal structure is complex to analyze  though it is important to discover useful patterns,  evaluate performance, locate anomalies and identify  problems. Visualization is helpful in performance  evaluation and interpretation of web usage mining  results. In this paper we proposed a tool comprised  of visualization and fuzzy association rule mining,  called Web Visualization System (WEBVS), as an  extension to the WMS for monitoring and analyzing  performances of e-Government websites.

1. Introduction  In the past decades, the rapid growth of ICT has  driven governments to digitalize documents, provide  information and implement online services in many  countries. On the other hand, such use of ICT has  increased pressure on governments to improve  performance and achieve ?a better government?.

According to [2], as governments are developing  more and more electronic services, they are also  coming to the realization that they often do not know  what kind of e-government citizens want. ICT tools  have provided governments with new ways to  provide information and to consult with citizens, but  determining the preferences of citizens and  businesses with regard to the structure and content of  electronic services rests a true challenge. Many  people would hard-pressed to be able to articulate  their expectations of government, even with a full  understanding of the technological possibilities.

The target users of an e-Government portal are  usually in three groups: citizens, merchants and  tourists. Their needs and preferences can be very  different. Taking care of them effectively and  reliably is the main objective of an e-Government  portal. It is necessary to ensure the information and  online services are delivered accurately, effectively  and efficiently to these three groups of users, hence  meeting their expectations and preferences. In [1],  we proposed a WMS to constantly monitor the e-  Government portal in real-time. The results of WMS  however come only in the forms of statistics and  performance reports. In this paper, we propose to use  WEBVS to visualize the results of WMS by showing  the discovered patterns and performance statistics  and superimpose them over the website structure in a  social network. Presentation of such information with  colors and thickness of nodes and edges is easier to  understand, interpret and locate anomalies or  interesting phenomenon than lists of statistics and  numbers report. We believe such a visualization tool  will assist the site administrators and analysts in  decision making, maintenance and analysis. In  addition to the visual graphs, WEBVS also outputs  association rules of the web access data obtained  from web logs. The association rules reveal the  relations between pages (services) visited and the  visitor?s browsing behavior. In Section 2, we discuss  related web visualization works. Section 3 tells that  how our WEBVS relates to the WMS. Our WEBVS  web visualization is discussed in Section 4 showing  the result graphs and describing the features and  functions. Section 5 comes the generation and  technique of the Fuzzy Apriori Association Rules we  use in WEBVS. Finally we draw a conclusion in  Section 6.

2. Related Work  In the past decade, researchers have been  exploring visualization methods for understanding  the activities that happen over websites. [6]. Recent  researches focus on the interactive visualization of  the web usage data. However, we have not found any  interactive tool or application developed specially for  visualizing and analyzing web access and usage in an  e-Government portal.

The authors in [3] introduced different 2D and 3D  visualization diagrams of particular interest,  classifying web pages into two classes of hot (with  many hits) and cold (with few hits) ones and  illustrating behavior of users. The framework enables  flexible selection of mappings between data  attributes and visualization dimensions for different  diagrams. In the case of large scale portal like an e-  Government, however, 3D diagrams will be too  dense to interpret.

In [4], the Web Knowledge Visualization and  Discovery System (WEBKVDS) is mainly composed  of two parts: a) FootPath: for visualizing the web  structure with the different data and pattern layers; b)  Web Graph Algebra: for manipulating and operating  on the web graph objects for visual data mining. The  authors presented the idea of layering data and  patterns in distinct layers on top of a disktree  representation of the web structure, allowing the  display of information in context which is more  suited for the interpretation of discovered patterns.

And with the help of the web graph algebra, the  system provides a means for interactive visual web  mining.

WebViz system, a tool to visualize both the  structure and usage of web sites, is proposed in [5].

The structure of a web segment is rendered as a  radial tree, and usage data is extracted and layered as  polygonal graphs. By interactively creating and  adjusting these layers, a user can develop real time  insight into the data. The system shows the idea of  interactive visual operators and the idea of a polygon  graph as a visual cue. The polygonal graphs,  however, are not straight forward enough and it  needs time to interpret to discover useful  information.

3. Proposed Solution  The analytic results from the four modules in  WMS together with the web structure are imported to  the WEBVS for visualization. The web structure is  rendered as a radial tree and the analytic results will  be overlaid on it by some visual cues. Web  administrations and analysts can select different data  attributes and thresholds to visualize. The web  graphs rendered by the WEBVS give the idea of how  an e-Gov portal is doing. Such presentation of the  portal status is easier to understand and locate  anomalies or interesting phenomenon than just lists  of numbers in a report. Together with the  performance reports generated by the WMS, the site  administrations and analysts should be able to know  the operating status and performance of the portal at  a glance. An overview of WEBVS in relation to  WMS is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Web-based Visualization System  In figure 2, performance data and web pages  information are input to the Integration Engine [3]  for data preparation i.e. extracting, cleaning,  transforming, integrating data and finally loading into  database and later generating XGML for interactive  2D visualization. There are two graph views with  analytic results mapping on a web structure radial  tree in WEBVS: static graph view visualizes the web  page information which only have changes after  updates, e.g. the HTML file size, content type,  number of words and links in a page, etc.; dynamic  graph view visualizes the web performance statistics  which is generated by the WMS and changes from  time to time, e.g. page views, active time, bounce  rate, number of clicks and visitors, etc. WEBVS  enables the web administrations and analysts to view  both graphs together and select their preferred visual  cues for finding interesting patterns. The Fuzzy Sets  Generator normalizes the active times on a page for  each page view and creates the fuzzy sets for finding  association rules.

4. Visualizing e-Government Portal  Definitions of e-government vary in its:  ? ?The use of information technology to free  movement of information to overcome the physical  bounds of traditional paper and physical based  systems? [7]  ? ?The use of technology to enhance the access to  and delivery of government services to benefit  citizens, business partners and employees.? [8]  The common theme behind these definitions is  that e-government involves the automation or  computerization of existing paper-based procedures  that will prompt new styles of leadership, new ways  of debating and deciding strategies, new ways of  transacting business, new ways of listening to  citizens and communities, and new ways of  organizing and delivering information [9].

Figure 2. A possible implementation architecture of WEBVS  4.1. Input Data and Assumptions  In addition to the analytic results from the WMS,  web structure should be prepared and imported into  WEBVS for visualization. Figure 3 shows the input  data for the static graph visualization in XGML.

Moreover, to discover the preferences and needs of  the citizens, merchants and visitors, we have to  identify what are their hot pages and what these hot  pages are about. Hot pages in [3] are those pages  with many hits. The number of hits received by a  website is frequently cited to assert its popularity, but  this number is extremely misleading. Therefore, our  WEBVS measures the hot and cold pages by active  time, which is the average amount of time that  visitors spend on each page of the site. The web  pages are classified into several content groups  according to their keywords, for examples: news,  information, media, e-services, etc. Then we measure  their popularities as hot or cold pages.

Figure 3. Input data for static view in XGML format  Visualizing such access data, our WEBVS can help  the web administrations easily identify what content a  merchant needs and what content should be  translated into a language.

4.2. Web Graphs  In figure 4, WEBVS visualizes the web  information in Static view and performance data in  Dynamic view. For both static and dynamic views,  there is an expandable control panel providing  options to configure the mapping between data  attributes and visual cues. The static graph view  provides the page information in complement to the  dynamic web access graph for web administrations  and analysts to figure out the anomalies occurring in  the web portal in a more efficient way.

The web structure is visualized as radial tree [10].

In the radial tree layout a single node is placed at the  center of the display and all the other nodes are laid  around it. The entire graph is like a tree rooted at the  central node. The central node is referred to as the  focus node and all the other nodes are arranged on  concentric rings around it. Each node lies on the ring  corresponding to its shortest network distance from  the focus. Any pair of nodes joined by an edge in the  graph is referred to as neighbors. Immediate  neighbors of the focus lie on the smallest inner ring,  their neighbors lie on the second smallest ring, and so  on. Radial tree layout is suitable for dynamically  changing graphs since the addition or deletion of a  node perturbs its siblings only by a small amount,  especially as the graph becomes dense. In WEBVS,  the focus node can be switched around by simply  clicking at one of the other nodes.

In figure 5, nodes are colored by content type, i.e.

green nodes represent pages with media content and  red nodes are downloads, while larger nodes indicate     that the pages have larger file size meaning the page  contains more content. This graph, when compared  with the dynamic graph with node size representing  active time in dynamic view, can clearly show if  visitors spend more time on a web page with more  content. If not, the page is having low performance  and the web administrator must find out the reason  and take action to improve, maybe by adding a link  in a related hot page.

Figure 6 is a visualization of web structure as a  radial tree showing what the hot pages are in the  dynamic graph view. The green nodes are those  pages with active time above the threshold set by the  site administrator. They are the hot pages on which  users spend most time in browsing and interacting  actively with the content. The thickness of the edge  shows the usage traffic. Site administrator or analyst  can select usage data of users from one country or  one user group to visualize. The analytic results from  the web log analysis module on WMS contribute to  this function. Actually, with the results from WMS,  WEBVS can visualize various web graphs of  particular interest. A site administrator can  interactively find out where broken links exist if any,  where page load time is higher than an acceptable  range, and other phenomena of interest.

There are various indicators of a website that can  be shown in the static and dynamic views in our  WEBVS with different visual cues. It will have a  more readable, meaningful and interesting web graph  when quantitative indicator relating to size represents  with node size and categorical or unevenly  distributed indicator represents with node color.

Table 1 shows a typical mapping we found in  WEBVS.

Fuzzy Apriori Association Rules  Association rule discovery techniques are  generally applied to databases of transactions where  each transaction consists of a set of items. The goal is  to discover all associations and correlations among  data items where the presence of one set of items in a  transaction implies (with a certain degree of  confidence) the presence of other items. In the  context of Web usage mining, it is used to discover  the correlations among references to various pages  available on the server by a given client. Each  transaction is comprised of a set of URLs accessed  by a visitor [12]. Conventional Association Rule  Mining (ARM) algorithms usually deal with  datasets with categorical values and expect any  numerical values to be converted to categorical ones  using ranges. In real life, data is neither only  categorical nor only numerical but a combination of  both. And the general method adopted is to convert  numerical attributes into categorical attributes using  ranges. The problem with the above approach to  dividing ranged values into sub-ranges is that the  boundaries between the sub-ranges are crisp  boundaries. Fuzzy Association Rule Mining (FARM)  is intended to address the crisp boundary problem  encountered in traditional ARM. The principal idea  is that ranged values can belong to more than one  sub-ranges is that the boundaries between the sub-  ranges are crisp boundaries. Fuzzy Association Rule  Mining (FARM) is intended to address the crisp  boundary problem encountered in traditional ARM.

The principal idea is that ranged values can belong to  more than one sub-ranges , we say that the value has  a membership degree, ?, that associates it with each  available sub-ranges. For example, we define three  age categories: Young, Middle-aged and Old, and  then ascertain the fuzzy membership (range [0, 1]) of  each crisp numerical value in these categories. Thus,  Age = 35 may have ? = 0.6 for the fuzzy partition  Middle-aged, ? = 0.3 for Young and ? = 0.1 for  Old.[11] Thus, by using fuzzy partitions, we preserve  the information encapsulated in the numerical  attribute, and are also able to convert it to a  categorical attribute, albeit a fuzzy one. Therefore,  many fuzzy sets can be defined on the domain of  each quantitative attribute, and the original dataset is  transformed into an extended one with attribute  values having fuzzy memberships in the interval [0,  1].

To measure the success or popularity of a page, as  we discuss earlier, we use the active time instead of  number of hits. When a visitor browses through the  internet, he/she will stay longer in pages that have  updated, useful and attractive content. In web log  files, we can find out the web usage data of a visitor  telling us where he/she locates, what pages viewed  and the active time spent on a page. We have no  problem in defining the locations of the visitors into  categories of countries or regions. However, to  discover what content they are interested in from a  set of pages, we can only measure the length of the  active time. In this case, we define the categories as  content groups of the pages which are the same as we  have defined earlier for the static view web graph, i.e.

News, Information, Download, Media and e-Service.

Then normalize the active time on a page into the  interval [0, 1] by decimal scaling normalization to  generate the membership degree of the categorical  attribute.

As in classical association rules, I={i1 , i2 , ... , im }  represents all the attributes appearing in the  transaction database T={ i1 , i2 , ... , in } . I contains  all the possible items of a database, different  combinations of those items are called itemsets. Each  attribute ik will associate with several fuzzy sets. In  order to represent the fuzzy sets associated with ik ,  we use the notion:  , where is the j th  fuzzy set.

Therefore, we have the attribute Page as follows:  FPage = { News, Information, Download, Media, e-  Service } and obtain a fuzzy database as in Table 2.

Table 2. Sample fuzzy database  After setting the support and confident, perform  Fuzzy Apriori algorithm and get interesting rules as  shown in Figure 7. We can see that visitors who  spent longer time on pages with the content of media  and download are from Macau.

Conclusion  The information and online services of an e-  Government portal should be delivered accurately,  effectively and efficiently to different groups of users  to meet their expectations and preferences. Knowing  the needs and preferences of users is very important.

For this purpose, WEBVS is proposed to visualize  the analytic and performance results of WMS  together with web page information in web graphs  and generate interesting and meaningful association  rules. Such web graphs and association rules help the  web administrator to discover and locate where  anomalies or interesting phenomenon are and, hence,  take actions to improve the portal when necessary,  for providing a successful e-Government portal.
