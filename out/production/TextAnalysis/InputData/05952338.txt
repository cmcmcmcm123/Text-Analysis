Success Factors of OSS Projects from Sourceforge  using Datamining Association Rule

Abstract? We present a research to find the success factors of 134,549 Open Source Software (OSS) Projects at sourceforge.net portal using Datamining 2-Itemset Association Rule.  Data from each OSS Project i.e. project?s audience, database environment, description, developer, development status, download, filename, file size, operating system, programming language, review, thumb (up and down), topic, translation, and user interface are collected and then stored into database to be analyzed using Weka Datamining Tool.  The Datamining Association Rule is used to find the success factors of these projects by assuming that the success is reflected by the number of downloads.  The success factors of these OSS Projects are found by performing 2-Itemset Association Rules.  The result is then formulated into six success factors that should be utilized by future initiators and other developers of OSS Project to increase the possibilty of success of their OSS Projects.

Keywords? Open Source Software Project, Datamining, 2- Itemset Association Rule, Success Factor, sourceforge.net

I. INTRODUCTION  Nowadays, Open Source Software (OSS) has become one of the popular term in Information Technology / Computer Science.  OSS Project is a software development methodology that allows developers from all across the globe to collaboratively download, modify, and improve the source code using Internet as the main communication channel.

Pioneered by Eric Raymond and Richard Stallman in 1990s, this ?movement? was initially seen as the way to develop software by researchers, academicians and programmers to share programming knowledge during their spare times.

Slowly but surely, this method receives greater acceptance as one alternative stream in Software Engineering.  There are already several success stories about OSS Project i.e. Linux Operating System, Apache Web Server, Mozilla Web Browser, etc.

Despite several success stories about OSS Project, many of these project were failed or stagnant.  Some approaches or strategies need to be discovered in order to assist an OSS Project initiator and other developers in increasing the chance of success for the project.  These approaches / strategies could be found by studying the existing small to medium sized OSS  Projects to find their success factors from one of the popular OSS development portal i.e. sourceforge.net.

This paper is arranged in six sections started with Introduction in Section I.  Section II of the paper shows the current studies relating to the success factors of OSS Projects.

Section III describes the theoretical background of OSS Projects as well as Datamining 2-Itemset Association Rule.

Section IV contains the Datamining Process starting from data colletion processing and data classification of the parameters collected.  The result of the Datamining 2-Itemset Association Rule is shown in Section V followed by Conclusion in Section VI.



II. CURRENT STUDIES ON OSS PROJECT SUCCESS FACTORS  Many studies have been conducted to identify the key success factors of OSS Projects.  One approach of the study is by studying several successful projects, i.e. the study on Debian GNU/Linux [13], FreeBSD [4], Apache Web Server [10], and OpenBSD [7].   Other approach is trying to find the similarity in the processes in many successful OSS Projects i.e. the study of Apache and Mozilla [9], fifteen Open Source Projects [8], and Arla and Mozila Projects [2].  Both approaches have the same weakness since they involve only relatively small number of OSS Projects, leading to the consequence that they may not give good representation of other OSS Project that already in hundreds of thousands.

The study of small and medium sized OSS Projects which are considered successful are more relevant compared to the study on large and mature OSS Projects since all projects are usually start from small size.    These OSS Projects could be found in many OSS Development Portal available in the Internet, one of the most popular web portal is the Sourceforge which at the time of this research (January, 2010) had 160,141 registered projects.  In this research, 134,549 OSS Projects are selected and their data are extracted and analyzed using Datamining 2-Itemset Association Rule to find their success factors.  This research could be considered an improvement of our previous research [6] which overviewed only 5000 most downloaded OSS Projects with 11 parameters.



III. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND  A. OSS Project OSS Project is a software development methodology based  on several distinct characteristics: ? The source code is freely available for everybody to  download, improve and modify [11].

? People who contribute to the development of the  project is forming a group called Open Source Software Community which is voluntary [3].

? The primary concern of the developers are building features and fixing bugs [5].

In order to develop software application in OSS Project, an initiator may use the service from OSS Development portal i.e. sourceforge.net, launchpad.net, google code, etc.  Table 1 shows some description about the number of OSS Projects in the world by recording the number of projects in some popular OSS development portals as observed on April 2010:  TABLE 1. NUMBER OF OSS PROJECTS IN OSS DEVELOPMENT PORTALS  Portal No. of OSS Projects  sourceforge.net 226,308  code.google.com 73,904  launchpad.net 17,975  freshmeat.net 4,004  TOTAL 322,191  Table 1 shows that the study of OSS Projects in sourceforge.net portal conducted in this research may provide a good representation since it covers quite large proportion of OSS projects.

B. Datamining 2-Itemset Association Rule  Datamining is a technique to find hidden structure and relationship in a large number of population [1].  The knowledge about these structure and relationship is discoverd by using two methods which are predictive and descriptive.

The descriptive method is selected in this research since it is intended to find the human readable patterns from all the data being collected from Sourceforge.net.  In this method, there are several techniques / rules that could be chosen which are Classification, Segmentation / Clustering, Association, etc.

The Association Rule is selected since it will find dependency rule which predict the appearance of an itemset based on the appearance of other itemset. One example of this rule with 2-Itemset is:  {A} => {B}    or      {A,B}             ..........   (1) Where A and B are items in which their relationship is to be discovered.  Item A is the cause (Antecedent)  resulting in item B (Consequent) with some certainty values called Support and Confidence.  The value of Support ({A,B})  shows the number of transaction containing item A and item B against total population, whereas the value of Confidence (A=>B) shows the probability of the occurrence of item B if a transaction containing item A and B.  In this research, the  selected minimum Support is 10% and the minimum Confidence is 50%.



IV. DATAMINING PROCESS  Table 2 shows the data description of the OSS project recorded from sourceforge.net portal.

Data Collection Process The data collection process of OSS Projects from  sourceforge.net was conducted by creating custom-made PHP script crawler. There are three phases fo the collection process: ? Recording summary of projects  (http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap) to record the name of the project, its description, date registered, latest version date, number of download, link of the project, topic, user interface, translation, programming language, operating system, license, intended audience, development status, and database environment.

? Recording project?s detail information by crawling each individual project link page to record the developer, project description, filename, file size, number of thumbs (up dan down), and reviews.

? Filling the missing information, finding and deleting duplicates and then generating count data from multiple- value parameters.

The collection process took about 9 weeks to complete starting from early January 2010 through the end of February 2010.  Out of 160,141 OSS Projects registered from the portal, the crawler was able to collect data from 134,549 unique projects stored in 27 tables with total 3,115,085 records.  The Datamining process was conducted by using Weka Datamining Tool (http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka).

Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the crawling system.

Fig. 1 Crawling and Datamining System  B. Data Classification Process  The next process is the classification of the data collected.

The following is the classification of each of the parameters.

1)  Audience: There are 121,095 OSS Projects (90%) of the recorded projects that list the audiences of its software project.

There are more than 23 distinct values of project's audience  which are then classified into three classes as shown in Table 3.

TABLE 3. CLASSIFICATION OF PROJECT'S AUDIENCE  Audience Class Population Percentage  Specific Audience  83,897 42.54%  Developers 57,391 29.10%  Common Users 55,940 28.36%  Where: ? Specific Audience: Advanced End Users, System  Administrators,  Information Technology, Education, Telecommunications Industry, etc.

? Common Users: End Users / Desktop, Other Audience, etc.

The classification of Audience Count for each OSS Project is shown in Table 4.

The project initiator has the freedom to describe his / her project.  If these descriptions are word-counted for each of the project, it shows an interesting result as shown in Figure 2.

Fig. 2  Distribution of Description Word Count  Figure 2 shows that the project description is mostly short with the peak at about 36 words.  If the project description is classified into three categories which are short (< 26 words), middle (26 - 36 words) and long (> 36 words), the classification of project description's word count is shown in Table 7.

TABLE 7. CLASSIFICATION OF PROJECT DESCRIPTION'S WORD COUNT  Description Word Count Class  Population Percentage  short 58,838 43.78%  middle 43,779 32.58%  long 31,767 23.64%  4)  Project Developer: There are 133,892 OSS Projects (99.51%) of the recorded projects list at least one developer.

Table 8 shows the classification of the count of developer for each of the OSS Project.

The number of download is 0 means that there is no download or the project does not have any downloadable file .

TABLE 11. STATISTICS ABOUT NUMBER OF DOWNLOAD  Download Population Percentage  0 / NA 55,986 41.61%  1 - 99 10,080 7.49%  100 - 999 33,539 24.93%  1000 - 9999  24,438 18.16%  10,000 - 99,999 8302 6.17%  100,000 - 999,999 1831 1.36%  1,000,000 - 9,999,999 322 0.24%  ? 10,000,000 51 0.04% Note: NA - not available (downloadable file is not yet available).

Table 12 shows the classification of the download of OSS projects.

TABLE 12. CLASSIFICATION OF DOWNLOAD  Download Class  Population Percentage  none 55,986 41.61%  hundreds or less 43,619 32.42%  thousands or more 34,944 25.97%  In this research, the number of download is assumed to be an indication of success in OSS Project.  If an OSS Project is successful, it will be accepted by many users that is indicated by the large number of downloads.  By referring to Table 12, the project that has Download - Thousands or more is assumed to be more successful than other classification (Download - none or Download - Hundreds or less).  In this research, the parameter Download with all possible classification was always placed as the Consequent.

7)  Filename and File Size: This experiment only records the filename and its size listed on the projects' site on the first page (http://sourceforge.net/project/project_name).  This filename is not neccessarily the only available filename, and there is also no guarantee that the filename is always the source code of the project.  The filename is then classified based on its extension as shown in Table 13.

TABLE 13. STATISTICS OF FILENAME EXTENSION  Filename Extension Population Percentage  zip 33,352 47.27%  tar.gz 20,970 29.72%  jar 5234 7.42%  tar.bz2 4108 5.82%  tgz 3540 5.02%  rar 1734 2.46%  other format 1612 2.28%  The size of the downloadable files was also recorded and then categorized based on its order of magnitude (BYTES, KB, MB, or GB). Table 14 shows the magnitude of the downloadable file size.

V. RESULT AND DISCUSSION  The process of Datamining 2-Itemset Association Rule is using Weka Datamining tool.  The class parameters were the combination of two parameters with the Consequent was always set to parameter Download.  There are 24 possible combinations of other parameters as the Antecedent and Download as the Consequent.  The result that have Download - Thousands or more as Consequent with Confident ? 50% and Support ? 10% are interesting values.

Table 28 shows all the result of Datamining 2-Itemset Association Rule the has Consequent Download - Thousands of more.

Project should target for common users as audience.

2. Project source code should already in 5 ? Production /  Stable development status.

3. Project should work on either Linux-like or Windows  operating system.

4. Project should be reviewed and thumb-reviewed by at  least one users.

5. Project has filename in zip format with size in MB in  magnitude.

6. Project should have either English or European language  translation.

Most of the above results are reasonable except for the file  size.  Stating Common users as audience will reach wider segment of users.  Users are also more interested in projects that are in reasonable level of maturity so they will select OSS Project which is already in 5 ? Production / Stable development status.  The selected Operating System in Windows or Linux-like are also reasonable since both are the most popular desktop-based Operating System.  The need for reviews and thumbs by other users seems to have good influence for another users to download and try the OSS.

The file size in MB magnitude appears with possible explanation that users are more interested in larger scale OSS Project than medium or small one.  Lastly, the English or European language translation is important since many of OSS Projects are originated from this region (English- speaking countries or other European language-speaking countries). It is also interesting to note that some freedom is still available for project initiator to decide i.e. topic, programming language and description of his/her project without affecting the number of download.

Some caution should be considered relating to these rules.

The subject being researched is small to medium OSS Projects      from sourceforge.net that may not reflect the whole population of OSS Projects that are small, medium and large scale.  These result should also verified using OSS Project data from other portal i.e. launchpad.net, google code, etc. to verify their validity.



VI. CONCLUSION  We present the Datamining 2-Itemset Association Rule of 134,549 OSS Projects crawled from sourceforge.net portal.

This covers about 84% of the total of 160,141 OSS Projects registered at the portal in the month of January 2010.  There are more than 27 parameter being recorded into MySQL database i.e. audience, audience count, database environment, database environment count, developer count, development status, development status count, number of download, filename and file size, license, license count, operating system, operating system count, programming language, programming language count, review count, topic, topic count, translation, translation count, user interface, and user interface count.

The result of this datamining process are 6 success factors that may be applied by project initiators and developers in order to increase the probability of success of their projects.

The details of the guidelines is shown in Section V. Future work of this research include expanding the experiment to cover other portal i.e. launchpad.net, google code and freshmeat.net.
