Abstract?Association rules mining is a popular and well researched method in data mining research field , its purpose is to mine interesting relations between attributes in transaction database. Classic Apriori algorithm is one of the most influential association rules in mining boolean frequent itemsets algorithms, However, it has some disadvantages such as inefficient in generating candidate itemsets and frequently scanning database, it is not suitable for mining multiple dimensional data model which rise in recent years. A "second cut" method is proposed, which is on the basis of the Apriori algorithm. The algorithm applies to multidimensional mining association rules, and to some extent improved the efficiency of the algorithm. Referring to the manufacturing resource planning system (MRP) features of the retail points, the article sets up the sales association analysis data model based on the above algorithm. It proves that it can increase the sales dramatically by applying this methodology to the real business environment.

I.  INTRODUCTION Due to the improvement of data collection capacity, lower  cost of data storage, and development of database and data warehouse technology, the past decades have witnessed a rapid growth of Internet and e-commerce applications, along with a massive accumulation of data. "Data explosion" began to be a serious concern in business, government and scientific domains. In the mean time, enterprises are increasingly facing tougher competition and more challenges in a more complex and sensitive marketplace. Therefore, timely access to relevant information and effective discovery of useful knowledge in business decision-making has become a critical issue in enhancing core competence and sustainability. In this paper, manufacturing resource planning system is incepted as a process to discover hidden, novel and potentially useful and understandable knowledge for supporting business operations and management decisions. The core technology of manufacturing resource planning system is data mining.

Nowadays, manufacturing resource planning system research and applications have been focal points of many fields such as business, information technology, engineering etc., for both  academia and industries.

In this paper, described is the implementation of a multidimensional association algorithm, Further, we use this implementation to generate interesting multidimensional association rules using data that represents papers. This paper is aimed at exploring approaches to discovering a type of important knowledge, namely, association rules, with major contributions in enriching knowledge representation and semantics, improving mining efficiency, and extending application domains, which are deemed novel and meaningful..



II. ASSOCIATION RULES Association rule mining is one of the best studied models  for data mining. In recent years, the discovery of association rules from databases is an important and highly active research topic in the data mining field. Association rule mining searches for interesting association or correlation relationships among items in a given dataset.

Association rules provide a means for representing dependencies between attribute values of data records stored in a database. Typically, Let I = { I1, I2,..., Im } be a set of items, and T a set of transactions, each a subset of I. An association rule is an implication of the form A=>B, where A and B are non-intersecting The support of A=>B is the percentage of the transactions that contain both A and B. The confidence of A=>B is the percentage of transactions containing A that also contain B (interpret as P(B|A)). The occurrence frequency of an item set is the number of transactions that contain the item set.

Association rules of such type are often employed in the context of market basket analysis, where an object is a purchase and features are associated with products or items.

A. Basic concepts R. Agrawal et al [1] proposed the first association rule  mining algorithm in 1993 to discover patterns in transactional databases from the retail industry and business. The idea to discover association rules is also named ?market basket analysis? because it looks for associations among items that a customer purchases in a retail shop. For example, when a customer buys item A, there is 90% probability he or she will also buy item B.

Sponsored by the Science and Technology Development Foundation of Tianjin Higher Education Institution (SB20080057)     With a transaction database D = {T1, T2, ...,Tn }where each Ti (1 ? i ? n) represents a transaction and a set of items I = { I1, I2,..., Im} where each Ij (1 ? j ? m) represents one kind of item, each transaction Ti records the items purchased by the corresponding customer, i.e., Ti ?I An association rule on this database is formatted as X ?Y , where X and Y are called itemsets, which are non-empty subsets of I, X and Y are disjoint. Two metrics are usually used to measure the reliability and accuracy of the mined association rule:  ? the support s of  the rule is the prior probability of X and Y,   tuplesofnumber  total  Y and Xboth  containing  tuplesofnumber   )sup( === n  YX YXs  ? ?  (1)  ? the confidence c of the rule is the conditional probability of Y given X,  X containing  tuplesofnumber Y and Xboth  containing  tuplesofnumber  )sup( )sup( =  ? =?=  X YX  X YXc   (2)  Intuitively, s can be viewed as the occurrence frequency of X in the whole transaction database D, while c indicates that when X is true, Y is also true with probability of c.

Two thresholds, minimum confidence and minimum support, are used by the mining algorithm to find all association rules whose support and confidence are above the corresponding thresholds.

B. The Apriori Algorithm Usually, an association rule mining algorithm consists of  two steps[2,6]:  1)Finding the frequent itemsets which have support above the predetermined minimum support min_sup.

2) Use the frequent itemsets to generate (strong) association rules that satisfy the minimum support min_sup and minimum confidence min_conf.

The Apriori algorithm pseudo-code:  L1 = {large1-itemsets};  For (k=2; Lk-1?n; k++) do  {  Ck = apriori_gen(Lk-1);  For all transactions t?D  do  {  Ct = subset(Ck,t);  For all candidates c?Ct do  c.count++;  }  Lk = { c?Ck| c.count?min_sup }  }  Answer = ?kLk;    Function apriori_gen( Lk-1,min_sup )  Ck = NULL;  For each itemset li?Lk-1  For each itemset lj?Lk-1  If (li[1]=lj[1])?(li[2]=lj[2]) ???(li[k-2]=lj[k-2])?(li[k- 1]=lj[k-1])?min_sup  then  {  c = li  join  lj;  if has_infrequent_subset ( c,Lk-1)  delete  c;  else add c to Ck;  }  Return Ck;    Function has_infrequent_subset( c,Lk-1)  For each (k-1)-subset s of c  If  s?Lk-1 then Return TURE;  Return FALSE;  An example of the dataset preprocessing is given in the table 1.

TABLE I.  EXAMPLE DATA BASE  TID Items 1 a,c,d 2 b,c,e 3 a,b,c,e 4 b,e    If min_sup =2,then candidate generation : C3={b,c,e}

III. MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASSOCIATION RULES The scope of most of our studies has been confined to  mining single dimensional association rules, where each rule involves a  single distinct predicate with multiple occurrences.

A typical such example is to find association rules like (3) among a large set of  a large set of transactions.

)"",()"",(, mousexbuyskeyboardxbuysntransactiox ???     (3)  Where x is a variable representing a transaction, buys(x,y) is a predicate which represents the purchase of item y in transaction x.

In manufacturing resource planning system, we would also like to mine association rules containing multiple predicates For example, one may like to find rules containing multiple predicates, such as (4):  )"80",( )"",(   )35"-"30age(X,Person  x  uanthoursandypriceofcarXbuys teacherXoccupation  < ????     (4)  or even rules containing multiple predicates with multiple occurrences.

Following the terminology popularly used in multidimensional databases, we refer to each distinct predicate in a rule as a dimension. An association rule is called a single dimensional association rule if it involves only one distinct predicate  and a rule is called a multidimensional association rule if it involves more than one distinct predicate. Moreover, a rule containing a predicate with multiple occurrences is called a rule with repetitive predicate. For example, rule (3) is a single dimensional association rule with repetitive predicate  rule (4) is a multidimensional association rule.

A.  Data Cube The database to be examined in our study is a relational  database rather than a transaction database. We believe that the latter forms a typical model for mining single dimensional association rules;[7,16]  whereas the former provides a typical model for mining multidimensional association rules. This is based on the following observation. A transaction database usually consists of a large set of transactions in the form of ?transaction_id: {set_of_items_purchased}?,and the rules to be mined are naturally related to one distinct predicate, such as buy(x, y)(as in (3)), where x is a transaction or customer identifier and y is an item purchased, which are single dimensional association rules, On the other hand, a relational database represents the relationships among multiple attributes and/or relations ,and the rules to be mined are naturally associated with multiple dimensions  . Similarly, data warehouses, object-relational databases, object-oriented databases, etc. they are constructed based on relationships among multiple dimensions, attributes, and/or relations , and mining multidimensional associations is expected to have wide applications  in manufacturing resource planning system.

In a large relational database, a data mining task is often relevant to only a subset of the data stored. Thus, a data mining task often contains a relational query portion which is first evaluated to collect the set of data relevant to the task. This set of collected data is called the initial relation of the mining task.

Mining association rules can be performed on a relation D in a similar fashion as that in transaction databases. However, we argue that it is advantageous to adopt a data cube structure for efficient mining of multidimensional association rules.

An n-dimensional data cube is an n-dimensional database, in which each dimension represents an attribute, and each cube data cell registers the number of tuples which match the corresponding n-dimensional attribute values .In our cube structure,  a special sum cell is added in each dimension. That is, if there are ai distinct attribute values in the i-th dimension,  the(ai+1)-st row represents sum, i.e., each cell in this row stores the sum of the cell values of all the previous rows in the corresponding column.

B. Multidimension Association Rules Algorithm ? Firstly, handle numerical attributes: static discretization.

For example : there are four dimension(A,B,C,D) in the database. The static discrete result is given in the table 2.

TABLE II.  STATIC DISCRETE RESULT  A B C D a1 b1 c1 d1 a2 b2 c2 d2  From the results as performed by Apriori algorithm, the sets of frequent 2-itemsets and 3-itemsets are given in Table 3 and 4, respectively, suppose that all the frequent itemsets with minimum support min-sup and min-conf.

TABLE III.  2-ITEMSETS  {a1,b1} {a1,b2} {a2,b1} {a2,b2} {a1,c1} {a1,c2} {a2,c1} {a2,c2} {b1,c1} {b1,c2} {b2,c1} {b2,c2} {a1,d1} {a1,d2} {a2,d1} {a2,d2} {b1,d1} {b1,d2} {b2,d1} {b2,d2} {c1,d1} {c1,d2} {c2,d1} {c2,d2}  TABLE IV.  3-ITEMSETS  {a1, b1,c1 } {a2,b2,d1} {a1,b1,c2} {a2,b2,d2} {a1,b2,c1} {a1,c1,d1} {a1,b2,c2} {a1,c1,d2} {a2,b1,c1} {a1,c2,d2} {a2,b2,c2} {b1,c1,d1} {a2,b1,c2} {b1,c1,d2} {a2,b2,c1} {b2,c2,d1} {a1,b1,d1} {b2,c2,d2} {a1,b1,d2} {a1,b2,d2} {a1,b2,d1} {a2,b1,d2}    When generates 4-itemsets, it can appear this items of {a1,b1,c1,c2},in this itemsets, two items of c1 and c2 appear with the same dimension, obviously this is wrong. We can apply the first cut in order to delete the itemsets which include two items of the same dimension, so it will not appear this kind items of {a1,b1,c1,c2}.

? Generation of frequent itemsets  Performed on the data cube data mining association rules is different from the previous section procedure based on classic Apriori algorithm. It consists of three steps: generate data cube, generate frequent itemsets and generate association rules. The procedure of look for the frequent itemsets consists of two step: join and cut, the cut procedure is the second one.

? The improved algorithm pseudo-code     Input : n-dimension data cube [d1,d2,?dn], min-sup  Output: n-dimension frequent itemsets L K=1;L=Null;  idC ,1 ={every differential value in di dimension }//generate candidate 1-itemset  id n  i CC ,1   = = ?   //join  idC ,1 to generate 1-itemset :C1  L1=gen_frequent(1,C1)  // Generate frequent 1-itemsets:  For(k=2;( ??+1kL  and nK ? );k++)  {  kC = gen_candidate(k, 1?kC );  //generate candidate k- itemsets  kL =gen_frequent(k, kC );  //generate frequent k-itemsets  ;kLLL ?=  }    Function gen_frequent(k, kC )  {  ?=kL ;  For each candidate I= kk Ciii ?},...,{ 21  do  {  frequency= count value in the k-dimension?s cell },...,{ 21 kiii  support=frequency/totalcount;  if (support>min_sup) then  {  I is frequent itemset;  };{ILL kk ?=  }  }  return kL ;  }    Function gen_candidate(k, 1?kC )  {  ?=kC ;  For each item 11 ?? kLI  {  For each item 12 ?? kLI  {  if(there are k-2 the same item in front of  items of I1 and I2 ,and the  thk )1( ?   item from different dimension)  then  {  21 IIc ?= ;  //join operation  if (in the c,exist a item that is the same dimension)  then delete c;  else  if?exist no-frequent k-1itemset in the c?  then delete c;  else  cCC kk ?= ;  }  }  }  return kC ;  }
