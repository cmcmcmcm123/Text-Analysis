Abstract?With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology, biomedical research has entered into the era of big data. It causes problems about storage and analysis of massive biological data which need to be solved by high- performance computing. Therefore, we build the localized high- performance one-stop data analysis platform to provide convenient and efficient computational analysis services for biomedical researchers. We deploy Galaxy and integrate software tools and datasets into Galaxy in computing cluster, build stable web service, FTP service and management database in order to optimize and improve the performance of Galaxy, and use distributed resource management application interface to collaborate Galaxy with Sun Grid Engine for automatically scheduling and assigning computing resources. Currently the platform has been put into trial operation. The peak performance is 10 Teraflops and the capacity of storage is 40TB. The platform provides many functions such as sequence alignment, short sequence mapping, gene annotation, transcriptome analysis, metagenomic analysis and phylogenetic analysis, and approximately 700GB reference databases including human genome, viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc..

Keywords-Localized; Bioinformatics; Galaxy; Online analysis; High-performance Computing  Along with the development of high-throughput sequencing and other genomics technologies, the need of biomedical research of data processing and analysis becomes more and more urgently. The rise of new areas of research and methods, such as metagenomics [1], genome-wide association analysis (GWAS), RNA-Seq and so on, gives birth to a large number of new bioinformatics software and analysis flow. Efficiently organizing decentralized software, building a unified database, providing a convenient and easy-to-use user interface, and using high performance computing to handle large-scale data and providing a one-stop local computing services, will greatly accelerate the data analysis process to promote the development of the biomedical research.

Web technology is an important means of integration for bioinformatics software. There are many successful systems  such as EMBOSS, Galaxy [2], NCBI and UCSC, etc.. Public service platform on the internet is generally provided by large research institutions. Their computing and storage resources for external users are too limited to meet the demand of large data analysis. For data security, users are usually reluctant to submit sensitive data to public platform. At the same time, the core data of many public platforms is not open to external users.

Therefore, to establish localized, high-performance data analysis platform, not only can greatly enhance the core technical capabilities for related research, but also effectively prevent the leakage of sensitive data. This paper describes how to build a bioinformatics platform which can simultaneously run multiple data analysis jobs, and provide commonly used bioinformatics analysis flow and database services by combining Galaxy with high-performance cluster.



I. RESULTS We have achieved the core functions of the local high-  performance bioinformatics analysis platform using the computing resources in Network Information Center of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences. We have integrated commonly used software and database resources in the platform. And with the help of powerful high-performance cluster, the platform provides functions such as sequence alignment, short string mapping, gene annotation, transcriptome analysis, metagenomic analysis and phylogenetic analysis for users.

Web Server The platform uses web technologies to provide services for  users. Registered users can use all functions of the platform, including data upload, datasets query and browsing, online data  analysis. In addition, for the data analysis processes may be repeated, the platform provides a workflow mechanism. Users can flexibly organize tools and datasets, create and save a workflow which can be invoked directly for the same data analysis. Fig. 1 is a CHIP-Seq analysis process.

Figure 1.  The Example of CHIP-Seq Workflow  D. High-performance Computing Resources The high-performance computing cluster of the Platform is  the Lenovo Deepcomp 7000, including one management node, 26 compute nodes (including two high-performance GPU nodes), and the capacity of storage arrays is 40TB. The computing network is 40G high-speed infiniband network, the peak performance is 10 Teraflops and the capacity of storage is 40TB. The data analysis requests submitted by users will be converted into the background computing tasks. The platform uses powerful computing resources for large-scale data processing to deal with the tasks.



II. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION  A. Module Design The platform consists of six modules. The relationship of  the various modules is shown in Fig. 2.

? Web service module. This module implements user registration and certification, FTP data upload, and unified web view. In addition, the module also implements another functions with MySQL database, such as user authority management and role definition.

? Cluster management module. This module monitors the status of the cluster, manages tasks and queues, and schedules resources.

? Tools management module. This module is used to integrate, manage and configure bioinformatics software tools.

? Dataset storage module. This module downloads databases from NCBI, UCSC and many others websites. In addition, the module saves, updates, and uses these databases to supply data navigation and inquiry service.

? Dataset format convert module. This module converts data format according to different application requirements.

? Data analysis module. This module enables users to analyze data online, or organize various tools and databases flexibly to create workflow. And then the module transforms requests of users for data analysis into computing tasks and submits to the cluster.

Figure 2.   Module Interaction    B. Technology And Implementation ? Build cluster computing environment. We Installed  and configured Rocks, Ganglia and other management software in the cluster to achieve rapid cluster configuration, status monitoring and other functions.

The cluster uses Sun Grid Engine to establish the distributed computing infrastructure, schedule resources, manage tasks and queues.

? Deploy localized galaxy. Galaxy is an open, web-based and world famous platform for data intensive biomedical research. It has a wide range of applications throughout North America and around the world, powerful and supports costumed development [12][13]. We deploy the Galaxy in the local high- performance cluster for large-scale data processing, and use Distributed Resource Management Application API(DRMAA) to cooperate with Galaxy. The data analysis tasks submitted to Galaxy through DRMAA will invoke Sun Grid Engine to generate the PBS scripts running in the background. Sun Grid Engine scheduler can automatically allocate hardware resources according to the load of the compute nodes.

? Build web and FTP services. We use Apache to build secure and reliable web services, such as user authentication, caching, data compression and small- scale data upload. Using the web server to upload large-scale data will degrade the performance of the web server. So we use ProFTPD to upload large data.

The data uploaded by users will be kept for a short  period, and will be used to analyze by the platform directly.

? Build data analysis service. Data analysis service is based on the Galaxy framework for customization and integration. The Galaxy framework provides unified web interface for tools and datasets. Users can submit and perform data analysis requests through Galaxy.

? Integrate tools and datasets. This service is able to download, compile, install and configure commonly used bioinformatics tools, format and index the datasets, and then integrate tools and formatted datasets into Galaxy in accordance with the organizational form provided by Galaxy. Users will be able to select the desired software tools and datasets to configure parameters and submit the data analysis requests through a browser. In addition, users can create inquiry, download and invoke reusable data analysis workflows by the installed software tools and datasets.

? Build data management and download service. We use a script program to download and update reference genome databases from NCBI, UCSC and other international web sites.

? Configure management database. We replaced the lightweight single-user database in Galaxy with professional relational database MySQL to enhance multi-user concurrent processing capability and scalability. The database is used to manage all user information, dataset information and workflow information.

III. DISCUSSION The platform has been put into trial operation, and  registered users can upload data to be analyzed, submit data analysis tasks, apply computing resources, create and use workflow. The software and data resources within the platform have begun to take shape.

We will continue to improve the function of the platform such as adding bioinformatics tools and datasets constantly, automatically downloading and updating data from NCBI and other sites. In order to achieve the rapid identification of important pathogenic microorganisms based on metagenomic sequencing analysis, we will parallel and optimize some well- known workflow such as Pathseq [14], Rins and so on. At the same time, we will study how to combine Galaxy with large data processing framework such as Hadoop [15], enable users not only submit the traditional PBS parallel computing tasks, but also run Hadoop-based biomedical analysis tasks.
