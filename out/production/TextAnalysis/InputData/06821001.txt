I. INTRODUCTION Cloud Computing model, which involves multiple com-  puters connected by networks, is being increasingly de- ployed as a fast and economic solution to various requests that require instantiating computing resources to serve cus- tomers? need. Despite the distinctions among the three commonly accepted service models (i.e., IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS), any large scale cloud computing environment requires the instantiation of multiple VMs (Virtual Machines) in a coordinated manner. For instance, a company providing a cloud computing service (e.g., real time stock market data) which is globally accessed by thousands or even millions of clients, may need to scale to multiple VMs if a single VM is incapable of handling all requests. These VMs may further need to be placed in geographically distributed data centers to allow clients to access close-by VMs based on their respective locations. Accessing geographically closer VM has the benefits of smaller response time, higher network bandwidth, hence better performance. In practical deploy- ments, once a VM is placed and assigned, users can be  easily directed to the assigned VM via server redirection approaches such as DNS.

When multiple VMs need to be placed in different data centers, there is an immediate question of which VMs are allocated in which data centers, a problem we referred to as VM Placement problem. As the users (i.e., clients that access VMs for cloud services) have different geographical locations, placing VMs appropriately in data centers leads to better performance experienced by the users. Take the following example. Assuming there are multiple data centers residing in major cities including Beijing and San Francisco, and totally three VMs are needed to serve all users. If two thirds of the users are located in San Francisco, while the other one third of the users are located in Beijing, then the best strategy of VM placement is to place 2 VMs in San Francisco, and 1 in Beijing. There is a further question of VM Assignment, that is, for a particular user, which VM should be assigned to the user 1. This question seems trivial, as the straightforward way of VM Assignment is to simply assign the VM that is nearest (i.e., with shortest geographical distance) to the user. However, as we will demonstrate in Section II, such a straightforward solution often leads to sub-optimal VM Assignment and worse performance.

In this work, we consider the above two problems of VM Placement and Assignment. Specifically, we consider a scenario where a fixed set of users are served by multiple VMs. We propose an efficient and effective way of placing VMs in multiple available data centers and assigning VMs to the users. To this end, we first consider two simple solutions that can be easily proposed. Though an optimal solution is deemed being NP-hard, we propose a solution that has close-to optimal performance, while runs much faster. Referred to as OCPA (Opportunity Cost based VM Placement and Assignment), the solution can achieve much better user performance (i.e., effective), and the running time complexity is kept linear.

1In this work, the two expressions of ?Users assigned to VMs? and ?VMs assigned to users? are used interchangeably.

DOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.81    DOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.81     An alternative solution to the VM placement and as- signment problem is to enable VM migration, that is, mi- grating running VMs across data centers to achieve better performance when current VM placement and assignment is suboptimal. Such solutions have attracted intensive re- search and discussions recently. However, VM migration is associated with certain challenges including implemen- tation complexities, network cost, service disruption, and computing resource wastage. Note that these VM migration solutions essentially work in an orthogonal dimension, and it is straightforward to develop an integrated solution that com- bines both VM migration and VM placement/assignement.

Thus in this work, we do not delve deeper into the discus- sions of comparing and integrating VM migration.

For the remainder of the paper, we first provide moti- vations for the problem in Section II. We then present the detailed algorithm in Section III. We perform performance evaluation and show the results in Section IV. We also present related works in Section V. And finally in Section VI we conclude the work and list our future activities.



II. MOTIVATION  We first define the problem we study, and then provide a cloud deployment scenario to motivate our design.

A. Problem Definition  The problem context that we will study is as follows. The assumption is that VM placement and assignment works in a particular cloud computing deployment. Such a deployment scenario includes the following components, as shown in Figure 1: (i) One or more data centers whose geographical locations are known; (ii) One or more cloud users that comprise the fixed user set, and their geographical locations are known. (iii) One or more VMs that are placed in the data centers, and each of the VM has an upper bound of the number of users it can serve. The following assumptions are also made to simplify the problem statement and solutions: (i) All VMs are identical in the sense any VM can be placed in any data centers; (ii) Data centers have enough capacity to place VMs; (iii) Other than geographical locations, data centers have identical relevant properties (e.g., price, net- work bandwidth, etc.); (iv) User experiences (e.g., response time, available network bandwidth) are dominated by the geographical distances; (v) The distances between an user and a data center can be obtained (e.g., through Geo-IP [1]).

With the above assumption and statement, we now for- mally define the problem as follows. The available data cent set is denoted by {DC}, user set by {User} and VM set by {V M}. Each V Mi is associated with a capacity value Capi. We also use Dist{V Mi,User j} to denote the distance between V Mi and User j. Note that though for easy description we use geographical distance as the performance metric, it can be adapted to use network distance or any other meaningful metric. The objective is to place the  required {V M} in {DC}, such that the total (or average) Dist{V Mi,User j} is minimized.

Please note that the proposed solution can easily be adapted to accommodate scenarios where some of the as- sumptions do not hold. For instance, if some data centers have limited capacity in terms of number of VMs placed, then these data centers can be removed from current consid- erations when capacities reach the limit. We do not explicitly discuss these adaptations here due to page limit. Also note that though we only consider the problem of VM placement and assignment, other relevant problems/solutions such as VM migration can be easily integrated into a complete solution.

B. Motivating Scenario  Consider a cloud deployment scenario where a global company would like to utilize a public IaaS provider?s platform to deploy 2 VMs serving 4 users. For ease of illustration, we assume each VM can only serve up to 2 users. The IaaS provider has 3 data centers located in different continents. The locations of data centers and users are shown in Figure 1(a). The company is free to choose any data centers to place their VMs, but apparently the nearer the user to the assigned VM, the better performance.

Firstly, let?s consider two simple strategies to the VM placement and assignment. In today?s practice, these two strategies are widely employed by many cloud providers. In Figure 1(b), we show the simplest strategy which randomly places VMs in data centers and also randomly assign VMs to users, which is referred to as RPRA (Random Placement, Random Assignment). At a glance, we see that user experi- ence is quite suboptimal due the fact that many VMs are not assigned to closer-by users. Particularly, if the users assigned to V M1 and V M2 were switched, users would have better average performance. So an improved strategy is to assign VM to nearest users, subjecting to VMs? capacity limit.

We refer to such a strategy as RPCA (Random Placement, Closest Assignment). The result with this strategy is shown in Figure 1(c). We see that V M2 are assigned to the two closest users of U3 and U4. As V M2 reaches its capacity, U1 and U2 are assigned to V M1. As we show in Table I, this strategy reduces the VM-User distance by about 20%.

Aiming to obtain even shorter VM-user distances, we proposed a few design components that can help improve  Strategy, VM- User Distance  U1 U2 U3 U4 Aggregate  RPRA 101.4 51.1 84.1 72.1 308.7 RPCA 58.0 106.5 37.6 45.0 247.1 Pop.-aware 101.4 36.4 34.4 45.0 217.2 OCPA 48.8 36.4 37.6 45.0 167.8  Table I RESULTS OF DIFFERENT STRATEGIES     ???  ???  ??  ?? ??  ??  ???

Motivating scenario and two naive solutions  on the aforementioned two strategies. These components can be combined into a single solution. First, the properties of users? geographical distributions need to be considered when placing VMs. We define a term of user population for data centers. Specifically, each user is ?associated? to the nearest data center, and a data center treats the assigned users as its population. This design component places as many as VMs in data centers subject to the associated population. We refer to this component as population aware. The resulting assignment of this component is shown in Figure 2(a). Note that for this assignment, if there are more users than a VM can handle, the users with shortest distances to the particular data center are assigned to the VM. We observe that this strategy results in another 12% reduction on VM- User distance than RPCA, as shown in Table I.

Second, we observe that the assignment shown in Figure 2(a) can be further improved by an assignment shown in Figure 2(b). The key observation leading to the new assignment is that assigning closest users to a VM may result in suboptimal performance. In other words, simply assigning closest users to a VM may unnecessarily leave other users being ?punished? harshly. To understand this, let?s look at the assignments shown in Figure 2(b). Comparing to the assignment of Figure 2(a), we see that the assignments of U1 and U3 are switched. Though U3 is assigned to V M1 in Figure 2(a) ( as U2 and U3 are nearest users to V M1), in Figure 2(b), U3 is assigned to V M2 instead. The benefit of such assignment change is that U1 now can have a much shorter distance to its VM (i.e., V M1 in stead of V M2).

From the perspective of U1, the distance to V M2 is the second largest distance to all VMs, which is thus defined as the ?opportunity cost? [2] of 2(a). The opportunity cost is a price Figure 2(a) actually has paid, because V M1 has exceeded its capacity after assigning U2 and U3, thus unable to take U1. Thus, rather than assigning VMs to nearest users, assigning VMs to users that have largest opportunity costs actually can help reduce the average VM-user distance.

Third, we also notice that in order for the above two design components to work effectively, the VM placement and VM assignment need to work in tandem, as opposed to working independently in RPRA and RPCA. The reason for this is that population-aware components works best when data centers? populations are dynamically updated, reflecting previous VM assignments. For instance, if the data center with largest population has placed and assigned a VM, it may not be the data center with largest population anymore, thus the next VM placement may need to start from another data center.

Motivated by the above observations, we propose OCPA (Opportunity Cost based Placement and Assignment). OCPA consists of 3 major design components of Population-aware, Coupled placement and assignment, and Opportunity cost aware, which are presented in Section III. For the particular sample scenario, applying all three components can achieve another substantial 25% reduction on VM-User distances over a single component of population-aware, as noted in Table I.

C. Investigations and solutions In the aforementioned VM placement and assignment  problem in cloud computing deployment environment, to this end, we propose an effective and efficient algorithm.

Referred to as OCPA, the algorithm places VMs in data centers based on user population, and assign VMs to users based on a novel metric of opportunity cost. Rather than always assigning VMs to the closest users, OCPA assigns VMs to users that have larger opportunity cost. For compar- ison, in Section IV we not only evaluate the performance of OCPA, but also consider other types of solutions.



III. DESIGN DETAILS A. Overview  With the problem defined in Section II, we now describe the design of OCPA. Compared to the straightforward strate- gies (e.g., RPRA and RPCA) that randomly place VMs in     ???  ???  ??  ?? ??  ??   ?  ???   ?  (a)Population-aware Placement  ???  ???  ??  ?? ??  ??   ?  ???   ?  (b)OCPA Figure 2. Advanced solutions  data centers, OCPA has the following three major design principles: (i) Population-aware. The VM placement is based on the ?perceived population? of users with regard to data centers. The perceived population of a data center is defined as the set of users that have the particular data center being the nearest one. A population-aware VM placement strategy determines the number of VMs placed in a data cen- ter based on the latter?s perceived population. In other words, the more closer-by users, the more VMs will be placed on the data center. (ii) Coupled placement and assignment. The VM placement is coupled with VM assignment. Though separating VM placement and VM assignment simplifies the strategy design, as shown in Sections II and IV, considering them in tandem brings certain benefits. (iii) Opportunity cost aware. The VM assignment strategy is uniquely based on the introduction of ?opportunity cost?, which denotes the distance to a user?s second nearest data center. In other words, when assigning users to a VM, by considering both the currently being assigned users and those left-over users, OCPA can achieve even further benefits.

B. Detailed Design  OCPA runs in the following steps, as shown in Figure 3.

In lines 1-6 of Variables block, we define a few notations we use in describing the algorithm. Particularly, the major inputs are the sets of {DC} and {User}; while the outputs are the set of {V M} with assigned users. For ease of description, every VM can handle a fixed number of Cap users. Also, each data center of DCi maintains a state of Unassignedi user set.

Now we move on to the Algorithm block in Figure 3 to go through the detailed steps. During the initial state, all distance pairs of Useri and DCj are computed, based on which the Unassigned j set is filled, as described in Lines 1 and 2. In addition, the ?opportunity cost? of each users, defined as the distance between the user and the second nearest data center, is computed, as shown in Line 3.

After that the algorithm consists of two parts. The first part runs when there are some data centers have more than Cap unassigned users, which indicates at least one VM can be placed, and the VM can be assigned to users from the data center?s perceived population. The second part runs when the unassigned users from a single data center can not fill a VM. Thus, two or more data centers need to combine their unassigned users to form a VM, which is then placed in the data center with majority of the assigned users. Now moving on to the first part, where a ?while? loop (Lines 4-10) will make sure all data centers that are able to place a ?full? VM have the VMs placed, starting from the biggest data center (i.e., with largest number of unassigned users). In particular, during the above process, these placed VMs are also assigned to users based on their opportunity cost. Specifically, the assigned users are those with largest opportunity cost, rather than those with smallest distances to the data center. The idea behind this is simple - if an user is not assigned to the nearest data center, then the user will be assigned to a further-away data center, the distance to which is at least the user?s opportunity cost.

In the second part of the algorithm, starting with the biggest data center (i.e., the one with biggest Unassignedi), VMs are placed and assigned one by one. Each time a VM is placed, it is always placed in the biggest data center. The VM is assigned to all the unassigned users of the data center, and also takes over some more unassigned users from other data centers to form a full VM. The taking-over process is simply based on the Dist{Useri,DCj} distances. This process loops until all users are assigned.



IV. EVALUATION  A. Evaluation Setup  We conduct the evaluation with a flat 2D area, where the inputs of data centers and users are placed. For repeatability and reality, we fix the locations of data centers, while     ???  ???  ???  ???  ???  ???????? ??????? ?????  ?  ???   ? ?? ? ?

Average user-VM distance of different strategies  randomizing the locations of the users. Though such a setup is a rather simplified one, we feel it is sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of OCPA. Specifically, we first consider a 1000 by 1000 map, then evenly place a fixed number of data centers. For instance, if 4 data centers are placed, then their coordinates are (250, 250), (750, 250), (250, 750) and (750.750). The set of users are uniformly placed in the 2D area.

We consider all the 3 strategies described in Section II: RPRA, RPCA, and OCPA. For simplicity, we assume each data center can hold as many as VMs, and the VM?s capacity is fixed. We vary the following variables: number of data centers, number of users, number of VMs. The performance metric we choose is the average distance between a user and its assigned VM. Since for all 4 strategies the data center set and user set are identical, the number of VMs placed is also identical. Thus, the average user-VM distance is an appropriate indicator of performance to compare. In the following, we use performance and user-VM distance interchangeably with regard to an user?s experience.

B. Evaluation Results  We firstly consider two scenarios with 2 and 4 data centers. The number of users is fixed at 20, while Cap is 2. Thus, totally 10 VMs need to be placed. The results are shown in Figure 4(a) and (b), respectively. We observe that RPRA causes the largest average User-VM distance, and RPCA works much better than RPRA, thanks to the assignment of VMs to closest users. OCPA results in the smallest average User-VM distance. For the two scenarios, OCPA beats RPRA on the User-VM distance by 68% and 66%, respectively.

Interested in more closely examining the specific perfor- mance of each user, we plot the user-VM distance for all the 20 users in Figure 5. For all users, RPCA?s performance is not worse than RPRA. This is because RPCA improves on the basis of RPRA by assigning a possibly closer VM to a user. As far as VM-user distance concerned, we observe RPRA >= RPCA >= OCPA, with RPRA being the worst and OCPA the best.

We further study the impact of data center set size on performance. Intuitively, with more data centers evenly distributed in the area, the performance should be better, as VMs can potentially be placed in a data center that is closer to each user. We fix the number of users to be 1000, and number of VMs 20. We then increase the number of data centers from 2 to 12. We measure the average performance for each of the four considered strategies. The results are shown in Figure 6. We observe that with more data centers, RPRA?s performance actually becomes worse. This is due to the fact that a random assignment of VMs causes inflated user-VM distance. For other 2 strategies, the performance becomes better with more data centers. For all scenarios, OCPA outperforms other strategies. In particular, with 12 data centers, OCPA?s distance is 50% shorter than RPCA, or a 2X improvement. Comparing to RPRA, the de-facto practice by most cloud providers today, OCPA?s distance is 82% shorter, or a 5X improvement.



V. RELATED WORK  VM Migration VM migration, which re-allocates VMs across data centers or physical machines, has served as an alternative solution to accommodate sub-optimal placements of VMs. Major OS and platforms including VMware and Solaris typically provide such options (e.g., VMotion and LDom [3]). In [4] several design options for migrating OSes running services with liveness constraints are considered, and a solution of migrating VMs on top of the Xen VNM is proposed and evaluated. Similarly, works [5], [6] study var- ious aspects of VM designs. Many works [7], [8] measures performance of certain VM migration strategies.

VM Placement The problem of VM placement on phys- ical machines has been studied in works [9]?[13]. Most studies consider the different characteristics of physical machines rather than data centers. The goal of optimizing VM placement thus is to save energy or computing powers.

Our work focuses on the VM placement across multiple data centers, while the goal is to improve the VM users? performance.

VI. CONCLUSION  In this work, we propose a VM placement and assign- ment algorithm of OCPA in large scale cloud deployment.

OCPA runs quickly and can significantly reduce the network distance between VMs and clients, hence improving the perceived user performance.
