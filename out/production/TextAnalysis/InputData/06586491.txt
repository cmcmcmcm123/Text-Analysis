Abstract: Company real estate (CRE) means the real estate such as land and buildings which owned by non-real estate companies in order to support the operation and development of the enterprise. In this paper, we will see the difference of CRE in different industries through comparative analysis of all the data.

We take the empirical analysis methods and build the regression model based on the data from the listed non-real estate companies in Shenzhen Stock Exchange to analyze the relationship between a property-intensive non-real estate company?s number of CRE holding and it?s market performance. In this way we can understand why there are a plenty of non-real estate companies hold the real estate asset as investment, even for some non-real estate companies, real estate asset have been their largest asset projects. In some countries the real estate assets owned by some largest non-real estate company are compared in it in some big real estate.

There are a plenty of non-real estate companies hold the real estate asset as investment. Even for some non-real estate companies, real estate asset have been their largest asset projects. In some countries the real estate assets owned by some largest non-real estate company are compared in it in some big real estate (Liow, 1995). In Singapore, the average real estate investment accounted for more than 40% of the company's tangible assets (Liow, 1995).

With the continuous development and improvement of China's real estate market, more and more non-real estate companies start to focus on real estate investment, and held a large number of real estate assets. The Chinese enterprises began to be more and more attention to the diversified investment. From proportion of the real estate to the total assets (PAI%), we can find out the CRE is very essential to the non-real estate company.

Why these companies are willing to hold so much CER? Many scholars put forward their views on this  problem, According to Machlica and Borunch (1989), the reasons are: ? CRE is considered to be necessary in the operation of the business; ? CRE can be viewed as a figure on the balance sheets that reflect the company growth;? CRE can be treat as a source of the capital increase, investment income, and a sources of profit growth. ? CRE can be the source of cash when the economic downturn; ? CRE can bring the company a batter markets performance. But Bruggeman et al (1990) pointed out that because of a series of corporate restructuring in the US since 1980s, the traditional understanding that the non-real estate company who hold CRE can be able to obtain a comparative advantage in the market has been increasingly questioned by company managers.

This paper will take the property-intensive non-real estate companies listed on the Shenzhen stock market as a sample to analyze the relationship between company estate investment and the real estate investment market performance and risk.

In this paper, we will see the difference of CRE in different industries through comparative analysis of all the data. We take the empirical analysis methods and build the regression model based on the data from the listed non-real estate companies in Shenzhen Stock Exchange to analyze the relationship between a property-intensive non-real estate company?s number of CRE holding and it?s market performance.

This paper includes five parts. Section1 introduce the basic situation of company real estate, the main writing motivation, Section 2 presents the sample of our research and do some statistical analysis to find out the data characteristic. We do Empirical Analysis and discuss the results in section 3, section 4. Section 7 summarize the paper and give conclusion.

2 Methodology   In this paper the data we used came from Shenzhen Stock Exchange?s mainboard non-real estate segment from 2007 to 2012. Because of the different asset structure companies from the finance and real estate segment should be excluded. Then we can get the panel data of 446 companies from 2007-2012.

July 17-19, 2013                                 Harbin, P.R.China    - 1678 -   2.1 Sample selection Consider that every company has different  proportion of CRE, so the different size of CRE holdings may give different impact on the market performance. So if we focus on the property-intensive non-real estate company it is much easier to reflect the influence of the CRE holdings? change. According to Liow (1999), we can use real estate asset intensity (PAI%) to judge if a company belongs to real estate intensive. But we think the investment property can better represent the CRE, so we use the investment real estate to calculate the PAI% of each listed non-real estate company. Calculate the average of the each listed companies? PAI% from 2007 to 2012. Take 20% as a cut-off point, if the PAI% is higher than 20%, it means the company is a property-intensive company. In this paper we use this proportion to filter the data, we can get the final sample, including 30 listed companies which come from four segments.

2.2 Data characteristics  Table1 listed the 30 sample companies? distribution of gross real estate holdings (PTYABS) and the PAI% in 2012. From this table we can see that the average real estate assets holdings of the sample companies reached 0.28 billion, Total real estate assets achieved 4.9 billion.

There are 15 companies' total CRE holdings more than 1 billion and property made up about 50% of the sample.

Figure1 showed real estate assets distribution. We can see majority companies? PTYABS was on the area between ten million to fifty million, Second large number of companies had PTYABS between fifty million to two hundred million. All these companies whose PTYABS between ten billion to two hundred make up about two-thirds of the sample. There are only three companies? PTYABS below one million.

We can find out the proportion of CRE varied from the lowest Industry companies? 20.38 percent to the highest Commerce companies? 49.57%, and the second     Fig.1 Real estate assets distribution   proportion is Composite companies? 36.29 percent. From this table we can draw a conclusion that industry companies need less real estate. They just need like Office buildings, production plants, warehouses, etc. But the commerce need much more CRE for example they need a large number of commercial real estate, so that is why their proportion of CRE is the highest.

The companies? balance sheet   Table3 describes the sample companies? real estate holdings in five years. The average value of company real estate increased from 0.152 billion in 2007 to 0.377 billion, the increase rate is 148%.The average proportion of CRE in total asset decreased from  29.79% in 2007 to 28.26 in 2012, In 2008 the proportion has reached to 32.07% than went down. The growth rate in composite group is the fastest, its PAI% ranged from 22.93% to 36.29%. The commerce group is the most property-intensive group with average PAI% is 47.56% over five years and its PAI% ranged from 38.61% to 49.57%. The social service is the last property-intensive group its PAI% ranged from 23.76% to 7.86%.

The book value is calculated by subtracting deferred tax debits from and adding deferred tax credits to the shareholders? equity on balance sheet.  is the corporate real estate ratio, which comes from dividing the real estate value by the book value of the company. Real estate is the sum of all the company's buildings and lands.

In particular, owing to the fact that some companies? annual reports may be released during April or May, for the data of company's book value and the value of real estate, we use those from previous year for period before June and those from current year after June. Besides, in order to control the impact of current market factors, the model also takes  into consideration, which is the weighted market return of the re-investment of the cash bonus.

Based on the results in Table4 Real Estate ratio  Tab.4 Various industries? regression results Industry Commerce Composite Social  service a 0.21519  (0.07698) 0.09717 (0.05217)  0.23902 (0.06714)  0.83775 (0.49991)  s -1.53716E-8 (1.056157E-8)  -8.31764E-9 (1.952274E-8)  -1.47376E-8 (7.110704E-9)  -2.85365E-8 (4.971682E-8)  h -0.00011224 (0.00012367)  0.00001646 (0.00006399)  -0.00003631 (0.00007633)  -0.00136 (0.00137)  l -0.09704 (0.13246)  -0.03284 (0.05606)  -0.17904 (0.12274)  -1.68398 (1.62367)  b 1.31236 (0.31277)  1.93602 (0.18227)  2.37494 (0.21610)  -2.67246 (1.80809)   has different impact on different industries, l is the sensitivity for the ratio. Real estate has a positive effect on yields of stock if I is positive, and negative in the same way. To all Intensive companies in all industries, l is -0.19912 and insignificant, which means the corporate real estate has no significant impact on stock yields. For each specific industry, the regression results show that only the compos it industry has an l with t value greater than 2, which is significant at a confidence level of 95%.

It indicates a positive effect of real estate on stock yields.

The more real estate, the lower stock returns.

Upon examination, p-values of I for the industry sector, the commerce industry and social service were 0.4647, 0.5592, and 0.3036, respectively. These reflect a relatively obvious effect of real estate on stock performance, although not that obvious. And all of them, impact is negative. For industry, commerce and social services, the regression results show that the corporate real estate ratio did not affect its stock yields significantly.

In summary, impact of real estate on stock returns is not significant for most companies. But it?s very significant for some specific industry (such as the composite). It also has considerable influence on some other industries (such as industry, social service).

3.2 CRE and risks  In order to further study the impact of corporate real estate on company stock fluctuations of returns, we establish the following four-factor regression model according to Fama and French?s (1992) idea.

(2) In this model,  represents the residual  from the regression of the mean of yield of each stock on the mean of yield of the overall market from Dec.2007 to Mar.2012,  is the mean of book value of each stock from Dec.2007 to Mar.2012,  is the mean of market value of each stock from Dec.2007 to Mar.2012,  is mean of property asset value from Dec.2007 to Mar.2012.

Based on the results in Table5, the parameter of Real Estate ratio regressed on the stock returns fluctuations is -2.3711E-10, and t value is 1.72 and p value is 0.06831 respectively, which is significant at a    - 1680 -   confidence level of 95%.

Because the changing in stock returns fluctuations represents the risk of the company's stock, we can get the conclusion: CRE has a significant effect on the changes in stock returns fluctuations under the consideration of all industries.

Based on the results in Table 6,the parameter of Real Estate ratio regressed on the stock returns fluctuations in industry sector and commerce sector is -5.572E-14and -1.8824E-10 respectively, and t value is 0 and 4.1 respectively, which is significant at a confidence level of 95%.

In other words, real estate has a significant effect on the changes in stock returns fluctuations. Because the changing in stock returns fluctuations represents the risk of the company's stock, we can get the conclusion: CRE has a significant effect on the changes in stock returns fluctuations under the consideration of all industries, that the CRE will bring reduction in the risk of stock significantly and reduces the volatility of stock returns.

It is mainly due to the return of real estate investment has is relatively stable, while the companies in industry and commerce sectors mainly focus on business which is dependent on the company's real estate, so the expansion of the scale of corporate real estate (CRE) will increase the efficiency of operations and reduce its operating risk, so as to reduce the volatility of stock returns.

3.3 Analysis of consolidated financial indicators: Altman Model  In order to further study the impact of corporate real  estate on company stock returns, we establish the following five-factor regression model according to Altman?s idea.

(3)  Where X1 =operation fund /gross total asset value; X2 = retained earnings /gross total asset value; X3 = earnings before interest and taxes /gross total  asset value; X4 = Market value of equity/ The book value of  total liabilities; X5 = sales proceed/gross total asset value; If Z>2.99, then the enterprise's financial condition is  good, the likelihood of bankruptcy is little.

If Z<1.81, the enterprise is likely to be bankruptcy.

Otherwise, it needs much consideration to  distinguish the condition of the enterprise.

We can see, the trend of z index is upward with the  PAI% rising and it reach its top when PAI% is 60%.

When PAI% exceeded 60%, the z index dropped. In summary, when PAI% is small, it has a positive effect on z index; when PAI% exceeds 60%, it has a negative effect on z index.

Fig.2 Relationship between PAI% and z index  4 Conclusions   According to modern portfolio theory, people usually think that if the company holds a diversified portfolio including CRE, It will improve the company?s returns on investment. However, the empirical results show that the income of the property intensive non-real estate companies who hold a large number of real estate assets is not better than companies who have no real estate investment. Through the analysis of the data of the listed companies in the Chinese market we found that the companies who hold CRE have a lower income and a higher risk. For the whole market this negative correlation is not very clear but it is very clear for individual sectors such as commerce, which is reflected a significant negative correlation with the number of CRE.

In this paper, the data we use come from China Shenzhen Stock Exchange listed non-real estate companies on the Main Board. By using regression    - 1681 -   method we do further analysis of the impact to the company's stock market performance by holding corporate real estate (CRE). Empirical research in the two dimensions of the industries and regions showed that there is a significant difference between CRE holding and companies? market performance in different industries and regions. The commercial industry is more significant than others, the higher the ratio of real estate lead to the lower stock returns. For all industries, there are also negative effects, but the impact is not very obvious. In the study of companies? risk affected by the real estate company, we found that the CRE holdings have a significant impact on the volatility of stock returns, and there are significant differences in various industries. Among them, the impact on the commerce is the most significant.

In the subsequent work, we will further do research on the real reason for why non-real estate companies held CRE, if the non-real estate companies did not get the return on risky investment by holding CRE that likely because these companies have other reasons to hold these assets in addition to the pursuit of gains, which may be due to other factors that affect the development of enterprises, and in the future we will do further study on this.
