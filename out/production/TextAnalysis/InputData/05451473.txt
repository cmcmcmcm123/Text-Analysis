I.  INTRODUCTION Thermal power unit is a very complex process system,  for its characteristic of multivariate, strong coupling, nonlinear, large delay and uncertainty, optimal control of thermal power unit has always been a very difficult problem.

Boiler combustion process is the most complicated process in thermal power unit which changes continuously due to coal quality, boiler load, changes in slag/soot deposits, ambient conditions, and the condition of plant equipment. The quality of combustion has a direct impact on boiler efficiency and emission of polluting gas, like nitrogen oxides (NOx).

NOx emission has been an important restrictive regulation in many countries in recently years. For instance, in the People?s Republic of China, the current NOx emission limit for dry bottom boilers with a capacity of 300MW and larger is 650 mg/m3, and it will decrease in the future [1]. As a consequence, the control of NOx emission is widely concern as the utilization of fossil fuels continues to increase, especially in coal-fired power plants.

Recently, combustion optimization has been proved to be an effective way to realize low NOx combustion and high boiler efficiency in coal-fired power unit [2-3]. In view of on-line plant data from distributed control system (DCS) and continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS), the  relation between NOx emissions, boiler efficiency and various operation parameters of the boiler is modeled using artificial intelligence such as neural-network, expert system, fuzzy logic, generalized regression and support vector regression. And then, by combining the optimization approach such as genetic algorithm, information analysis and ant colony optimization, the model is applied to search the optimal operation parameters to achieve the two targets.

However, data used in the above methods should be got by many experiments in power plant which usually are hardly to realize for safe concern. And in some papers, some special data points are selected to construct models between NOx emissions, boiler efficiency and operation parameters.

Obviously, the results achieved may not be scientific.

With the development of supervised information system (SIS) in China, more and more real-time data are sent to database and large amounts of data are accumulated.

Data Mining, sometimes referred to as knowledge discovery from databases, is a non-trivial process of identifying implicit, valid, novel, potentially useful and ultimately understandable patterns in data. Researchers and engineers attempt to apply it in industrial monitoring and control process and achieve great success. McGreavy and Wang X Z use the KDD techniques to identify the status of the chemical industrial process in Britain [4]. Tony Ogilvie and B W Hogg put forward method to establish the operating models in power plant by data mining techniques [5].

In this paper, a complete resolution strategy for combustion optimization is proposed based on data mining technology. Steady operating data are selected and cluster technology is used to classify operating condition. Then, fuzzy sets theory is introduced into the association mining for continuous data and optimal target values of some important operation parameters for combustion optimization is obtained to achieve the target of high boiler efficiency and low NOx emission.



II. STRUCTURE OF COMBUSTION OPTIMIZATION Among all the impacting factors of combustion process,  fuel and air parameters are the most important controllable parameters. Ratio of air flow and fuel flow is a key parameter affecting combustion condition in boiler. Proper ratio can guarantee complete combustion of fuel in boiler. If  Volumn 2  978-1-4244-5586-7/10/$26.00      2010 IEEEC     the ratio is too large, heat loss of the flue gas will increase which can bring decrease of boiler efficiency; meanwhile, temperature of flame is not high and generation of NOx can be restrained. Otherwise, if the ratio is too small, fuel can?t burn completely and heat loss of boiler will increase. So for the target of high boiler efficiency and low NOx emission, proper ratio of air flow and fuel flow must be concerned.

For the reason of fluctuation of boiler load and quality of fuel, ratio of air and fuel should follow the changes of ambient conditions, but not a constant. Then, under different operation conditions, how to judge the ratio of air and fuel flow? O2 content in flue gas is used to solve this problem. O2 content in flue gas directly reflects the condition of combustion in boiler. Air flow ratio-cascade control system in power plant is show inside the dotted line in fig 1.

Figure 1. Control system of ratio of air and fuel flow and O2 content Now the setpoints of O2 content and ratio of air and fuel  flow f(x) are set by designed values of boiler. However, with changes of boiler equipment and ambient conditions, these values will not be optimal either for high boiler efficiency or low NOx emission. So data mining technology is employed in this study to approach the optimal setpoints of ratio f(x) and O2 content. And the theory structure is shown in fig 1.



III. DATA MINING ALGORITHM  A. Steady Operating Conditon Operating condition of power unit is changing a lot and  only data in steady state can be used for data mining. Steady state of a unit is defined as:  (1) Coordinated control system is on automatic control and important auxiliary equipments are running normally.

(2) Actual load and main steam pressure should be in steady state. The stability index of two parameters is defined as follows.

First, normalize the two parameter values:  nk A  AA k  e B ,...2,1,  minmax =< ?  = ??  (1)  Where maxA  and minA  are maximum and minimum of parameters in a period, eA  is rated value at rated load, and k?  is stability threshold.

The method used to judge parameter?s stability is described as below. In a period of time (such as 20 minutes), equation (1) should be satisfied with a certain stability threshold, e.g. 0.05k? = . Otherwise, set start point and end point of the judging period to 10 minutes later, a new set of data containing 20 minutes operation conditions can be obtained. Then, judgment on stability can be made again.

A better method is the statistical analysis based on the ratio in (1). Assuming enough ratio data sequence B?  are obtained: 1B? , 2B? , ?, BN? , N 20. Then the average value is:  NBNBBB /)...( 21 ???? +++=  (2) Standard deviation ?  is calculated and then the  stability index cx  is obtained:  ? ??= )1/()( 2 NBBi ??? ?? 3?= Bcx  (3)  When Bi?  has been smaller than cx  continuously for more than 20 minutes, the unit is judged as in steady state.

B. Fuzzy Association Rule Mining Algorithm In this paper fuzzy sets theory was introduced into the  association mining for quantitative data in power plant. The proposed fuzzy mining algorithm first transforms each quantitative value into a fuzzy set using membership functions. The algorithm then calculates the scalar cardinality of each linguistic term on all the transaction data using the temporary set fC . The linguistic term with the maximum cardinality is used in later mining processes only, thus keeping the number of items the same as that of the original attributes. The mining process based on fuzzy counts is then performed to find fuzzy association rules. The detailed mining algorithm is described as follows.

Input: A body of n  transaction data, each with m attribute values, a set of membership functions, a predefined minimum support value and a predefined confidence value.

The p -th attribute in the j -th ( nj ,,2,1 ?= ) transaction can be described by k  membership functions  )( ps j p R? ks ,,2,1 ?= ,  p sR ks ,,2,1 ?=  is  fuzzy set.

Output: A set of fuzzy association rules.

Step 1: Transform the quantitative value jpt  ( mp ,,2,1 ?= ) of each transaction jT  ( nj ,,2,1 ?= )  in D into a fuzzy set jpf . So j pt  is described by fuzzy sets  as:  Volumn 2     p k  p k  j p  p  pj p  p  pj pj  p R R  R R  R R  f )()()(     1 ??? +++= ?  (4)  where spR  ( ks ,,2,1 ?= )is p -th fuzzy region of attribute jT ( nj ,,2,1 ?= ), and jT  is j -th transaction in D.

Step 2: Build a temporary set 1C  including all the pairs ( spR , )(  p s  j p R? ) of each data, where p =1,2, m,? ,  s =1,2, k,? . For each region spR  stored in 1C  calculate it scalar cardinality for all transactions:  )(  , p  s  n  j  j p  j sp Rweight ?  =  = ?  (5)  Step 3: Find )(max ,1 max j  sp  k  sp weightweight  = = , for  p =1 to m, where k is the number of fuzzy regions for transaction jT ( nj ,,2,1 ?= ).

max pweight will be used to  represent this attribute in later mining process.

Step 4: Check whether the maxpweight of each  max pR ( p =1,2, m,? ) is larger than or equal to the  predefined minimum support. If maxpR ( p =1,2, m,? ) is equal to or larger than the minimum support, put it into the set of large 1-itemsets( 1L ). That is,  ?= maxmax1 |{ pp weightRL minsupport, }1 mp ?? (6)  Step 5: Set 1=r , where r is used to represent the number of items kept in the current large itemsets.

Step 6: Generate the candidate set 1+rC  from rL .

Restated, the algorithm joins rL  and rL  under the condition that 1?r  items in the two itemsets are the same and the other one is different. The itemsets which have all their sub-r-itemsets in rL  are put into 1+rC .

Step 7: Do the following substeps for each newly formed (r+1)-itemset ),,,( 121 += rtttt ?  in 1+rC :  (a) For each transaction jT , calculate its fuzzy value on ?t ( 1,,2,1 += r?? ) as:  )()()( maxmaxmax 112211 ++  ???= rr p  j pp  j pp  j p  j t RRR ???? ? ?  (7) Where j =1 to n. If the minimum operator is used for  the intersection, then  )(min max  ??? ??  ? p j p  r j  t R +  =  (8)  (b) Calculate ? =  = n  j  j ttweight  ??  ?  using 1+rC .

(c) If ?t  weight  is larger than or equal to the predefined minimum support, put ),,,( 121 += rtttt ?  into  1+rL .

Step 8: If 1+rL  is null, then do the next step; otherwise,  set 1+= rr  and repeat Step 6 to 8.

Step 9: Construct the association rules for all large q -  itemset t  with items ),,,( 21 qttt ? , 2?q  using the following substeps:  (a) Form all possible association rules as follows:  kqkk ttttt ?????? +? ?? 111 , qk ,,2,1 ?= (9)  (b) Calculate the confidence values of all association rules using:  )(   j t  j t  j t  n  j  j t  n  j  j t qkk  ????? ?  ????? +???  ==  ??   (10)  Step 10: Output the rules with confidence value larger than or equal to the predefined minimum confidence.

After step 10, the rules constructed are output and can act as the meta-knowledge for the given transaction. It is expressed based on reasoning and is easy to be understood.



IV. APPLICATION Based on the history data of a 600MW power plant unit,  typical parameters which are related to combustion optimization are analyzed. The selected parameters include boiler load, coefficient of coal quality, ratio of air and fuel flow f(x), O2 content, boiler efficiency, NOx emission.

Among of these parameters, coefficient of coal quality is a parameter constructed approximately reflecting quality of fuel, which can be calculated by unit load/total fuel flow.

Based on the steady condition, a total of 986 transactions consisted of parameters in different load condition in recent four months are obtained, which is shown in table 1.

TABLE 1.  HISTORY  DATA IN STEADY OPERATION CONDITION  TI D  Load (MW)  coefficient of coal quality  Rati o f(x)  O2 conten t(%)  boiler efficiency (%)  NOx emissio n (mg/m3)  1 597.4 2.17 3.71 2.28 93.92 669.83 2 530.6 2.14 4.1 3.7 93.50 878.62 3 310.1 2.21 5.85 6.69 93.6 833.95 4 400.4 2.22 5.72 6.59 92.98 907.59 5 520.2 2.26 4.16 3.33 93.62 726.43 ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ? 986 600.3 2.26 3.97 2.28 94.08 652.63   Volumn 2     Unit load follows the demand of AGC (Automatic Generation Control) in China and it varies in a large range.

Cluster method is employed to classify the load data and (300MW-600MW) load range is divided into ten clusters: [299.8 312.59] [320.23 340.3] [347.24 375.6] [377.24 410.04] [420.07 440.74] [449.18 475.32] [477.7 511.83] [517.73 551.69] [555.29 584.19] [584.68 601.61]. Then, in every load cluster, fuzzy association rule algorithm is applied to analyzing history data and rules like Load(Li): Parameter 1(Pi),?,Parameter n(Ti) ?Target 1(Mi), Target 2(Ni) can be obtained.

Taking load cluster [584.68 601.61] for example, optimal rules for combustion optimization are extracted.

The minimum support value is set at 0.15 and the minimum confidence value is set at 50%. The membership function of the O2 content is shown in fig 2. Other parameters? membership functions are similar with this one.

?  Figure 2. The membership function of the O2 content The output of association rule algorithm is as follows:  when boiler efficiency is [93.7, 94.2] and NOx emission is [540.4, 709.95], ratio f(x) is [4.36, 4.97] and O2 content is [2.37, 2.64], with a support value of 0.186 and a confidence value of 57%. It satisfies the requirement of minimum support and minimum confidence. This rule means that: when the load is in [584.68 601.61]MW, boiler efficiency is very high and NOx emission is lower, optimal range of ratio f(x) and O2 content are respectively 4.36~4.97 and 2.37~2.64. By using the average method, optimal setpoints of these two parameters can be set at 4.67 and 2.51%.

The obtained setpoints of ratio of air and fuel flow and O2 content in different load cluster was applied to the control system in fig 1. And the performance of boiler was improved obviously.



V. CONCLUSION Combustion optimization is the mainly method to  improve boiler performance and decision of air and fuel parameters? optimal values is the key point in combustion optimization. In this paper, fuzzy sets theory is introduced into the association mining process in order to soften the partition boundary of the domain and generalize the data.

And then, fuzzy association rule algorithm is employed to find optimization setpoint values of important parameters of combustion process. Based on history data in power plant, the obtained optimization values are reachable in operation and easy to guide operation.
