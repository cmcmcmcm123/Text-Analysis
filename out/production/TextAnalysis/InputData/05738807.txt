Abstract? Data mining is the process of extracting hidden information from the database. Data mining is emerging as one of the key features of many business organizations. The current trend in business collaboration shares the data and mined results to gain mutual benefit. The problem of privacy-preserving data mining has become more important in recent years because of the increasing ability to store personal data about users, and the increasing sophistication of data mining algorithms to leverage this information. Apart from classification and regression, one of the most important tasks of data mining is to find patterns in data. In particular, new advances in data mining and knowledge discovery that allow for the extraction of hidden knowledge in enormous amount of data impose new threats on the seamless integration of information. In this paper, we consider the problem of building privacy preserving algorithms for one category of data mining techniques, the association rule mining.

I. INTRODUCTION Data mining is a recently emerging field, connecting the  three worlds of Databases, Artificial Intelligence and Statistics. The information age has enabled many organizations to gather large volumes of data. However, the usefulness of this data is negligible if ?meaningful information? or ?knowledge? cannot be extracted from it.

Data mining, otherwise known as knowledge discovery, attempts to answer this need. In contrast to standard statistical methods, data mining techniques search for interesting information without demanding a priori hypotheses. Privacy- preserving data mining considers the problem of running data mining algorithms on confidential data that is not supposed to be revealed even to the party running the algorithm. There are two classic settings for privacy-preserving data mining (although these are by no means the only ones).

In the first, the data is divided among two or more different parties; the aim being to run a data mining algorithm on the union of the parties' databases without allowing any party to view another individual's private data. A classical example of a privacy-preserving data mining Problem of the first type  occurs in the field of medical research. Consider the case of a number of different hospitals that wish to jointly mine their patient data for the purpose of medical research. Furthermore, let us assume that privacy policy and law prevents these hospitals from ever pooling their data or revealing it to each other, due to the confidentiality of patient records. This is another example where privacy-preserving data mining could be used to balance real privacy concerns with the needs of governments to carry out important research.

Association rule algorithms produce thousands of rules, many of which are redundant (Li & Zhang, 2003; McGarry, 2005). In order to filter the rules, the user generally supplies a minimum threshold for support and confidence. [1] Support and confidence are basic measures of association rule interestingness. Additionally, these are the most common measures of interest. However, generating rules that meet minimum thresholds for support and confidence may not be interesting. This is because rules are often produced that are already known by a user who is familiar with the application domain. The challenge in association rule mining (ARM) essentially becomes one of determining which rules are the most interesting. With so many interestingness rules to choose from, it is difficult to determine which one to use for a given domain. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that different interestingness measures produce different results for the same data set, thus making it difficult for the user to interpret the measures (McGarry, 2005).

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present an overview of Association rule mining. Section 3 discusses about association rule techniques. Section 4 gives a review on Association rule hiding in privacy preserving data mining .Section 5 discusses about interesting measures in Association rule mining.  Analyses of papers are given in Section 6.Conclusion are given in section 7.



II. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING Association rule hiding refers to the process of  modifying the original database in such a way that certain sensitive association rules disappear without seriously affecting the data and the non-sensitive rules. Association rule    Privacy Preserving Data Mining Based on Association Rule- A Survey      mining is defined as: Let be a set of n binary attributes called items. Let  be a set of transactions called the database. Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I. A rule is defined as an implication of the form X?Y where  and . The sets of items (for short item sets) X and Y are called antecedent (left-hand-side or LHS) and consequent (right-hand-side or RHS) of the rule respectively ? The support supp(X) of an item set X is defined as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contain the item set. In the example database, the item set {milk, bread} has a support of 2 / 5 = 0.4 since it occurs in 40% of all transactions (2 out of 5 transactions).

? The confidence of a rule is defined   For example, the rule  has a confidence of 0.2 / 0.4 = 0.5 in the database, which means that for 50% of the transactions containing milk and bread the rule is correct.

Yehuda Lindell, Benny Pinkas introduce The issue of privacy preserving data mining. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which two parties owning confidential databases wish to run a data mining algorithm on the union of their databases, without revealing any unnecessary information.

This work is motivated by the need to both protect privileged information and enable its use for research or other purposes[12].

The above problem is a specific example of secure multi- party computation and as such, can be solved using known generic protocols. However, data mining algorithms are typically complex and, furthermore, the input usually consists of massive data sets. The generic protocols in such a case are of no practical use and therefore more efficient protocols are required. We focus on the problem of decision tree learning with the popular ID3 algorithm. Our protocol is considerably more efficient than generic solutions and demands both very few rounds of communication and reasonable bandwidth.

Lee and Siau captures Data mining algorithms should be flexible enough to deal with data from different sources.

Finally, a major concern within data mining today is the threat to privacy and data security. This is because data mining makes it easy to establish profiles of individuals based on data from multiple sources.

One research team (Lee & Siau, 2001) outlined the requirements and challenges associated with data mining.

? Data mining must be able to handle different types of data.

? Data mining algorithms must be scalable and efficient.

? Data mining must be able to handle noisy and missing data.

? Data mining techniques should present results in a way that is easy to understand.

? Data mining techniques should support requests at different levels of granularity. That is, data   mining can be done at different levels of abstraction.

Murat Kantarcioglu, Chris Clifton proposed Data mining can extract important knowledge from large data collections.

These collections are split among various parties. Privacy concerns may prevent the parties from directly sharing the data and some types of information?s about the data. This addresses secure mining of association rule over horizontally partitioned data.[7] The methods incorporate cryptographic techniques to minimize the information shared, while adding little overhead to the mining task.

Matthew Eric Otey, Chao Wang, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, Adriano Veloso, Wagner Meria introduce Traditional methods for frequent itemset mining typically assume that details centralized and static. Such method supposes excessive communication overhead when data is distributed, and they waste computational resources when data is dynamic. First unified approach that overcomes these assumptions. These approaches makes use of parallel and incremental technique to generate frequent itemsets in the presence of data updates without examining the entire database and imposes minimal communication overhead when mining distributed databases.

These approaches are able to generate both local and global frequent itemsets. [5] This ability permits our approach to identify high contrast frequent item sets, which allows one to examine how the data is skewed over different sites.

Juliano Brito Da Justa, Marina Teresa Pires Vieria, Marina Teresa, Pires Vieira introduce Parallel and distributed association rule mining are very important research subjects, with various work addressing them. Data skewness, which describes the degree of non-uniformity of the itemset distribution among database partitions, causes various problems to parallel and distributed association rule mining algorithms, such as the generation of many false candidate itemsets. Some algorithms employ techniques in order to not only overcome these problems but also to take advantage of data skewness with the purpose of improving their performance. For instance, some algorithms employ skewness based pruning techniques. In the literature, an entropy-based metric has been used for measuring data skewness. A method for identifying skewed itemsets which uses tests of statistical hypotheses. [4] This method has some advantages over the entropy-based method and can also be used in environments with privacy-preserving constraints.

Gediminas Adomavicius, Alexander Tuzhilin proposed an overview of the field of recommender systems and describes the current generation of recommendation methods that are usually classified into the following three main categories (2005) content-based, collaborative, and hybrid recommendation approaches. The various limitations of current recommendation methods and discusses possible extensions that can improve recommendation capabilities and make recommender systems applicable to an even broader       range of applications. These extensions include, among others, an improvement of understanding of users and items, incorporation of the contextual information into the recommendation process, support for multcriteria ratings, and a provision of more flexible and less intrusive types of recommendations.

Kotsiantis and Kanellopoulos proposed Association rule mining is a category of data mining tasks that correlate a set of items with other sets of items in a database. Association rules "aim to extract interesting correlations, frequent patterns, associations or causal structures among sets of items in the transaction databases or other repositories?.

Sheng Zhong introduces Standard algorithms for association rule mining is based on identification of frequent itemsets. How to maintain privacy in distributed mining of frequent itemsets. Two (or more) parties can find frequent itemsets in a distributed database without revealing each party's portion of the data to the other.[11] The existing solution for vertically partitioned data leaks a significant amount of information, while the existing solution for horizontally partitioned data only works for three parties or more. The design algorithms for both vertically and horizontally partitioned.

Dan Bogdanov , Richard Sassoon proposed The statistical analysis of data warehouses, i.e., repositories for an organization?s data, is used for finding patterns or trends that are useful in decision making. This process is often called data mining. One way to use such data is through collaborative ltering, in which suggestions are given to a user based on previous transactions of other users. The question of privacy in this context is important, since one doesn?t want to disclose his private transaction in order to perform this analysis. This is so even, if disclosing this information gives the user to some service. An alternative solution to cryptographic and statistical randomization algorithms for privacy preserving association- rule mining for collaborative, ltering applications. [3] This is achieved by using a multi-purpose framework.

Mohammad Naderi Dehkordi, Kambiz Badie, Ahmad Khadem Zadeh proposed Extracting of knowledge form large amount of data is an important issue in data mining systems.

One of most important activities in data mining is association rule mining and the new head for data mining research area is privacy of mining.[8] Today association rule mining has been a hot research topic in Data Mining and security area. A lot of research has done in this area but most of them focused on perturbation of original database heuristically. Therefore the final accuracy of released database falls down intensely. In addition to accuracy of database the main aspect of security in this area is privacy of database that is not warranted in most heuristic approaches, perfectly. In this paper introduce new multi-objective method for hiding sensitive association rules based on the concept of genetic algorithms. [6] The main purpose of this method is fully supporting security of database and keeping the utility and certainty of mined rules at highest level.

?Aris Gkoulalas- Divanis, Member, IEEE, and Vassilios S.Verykios, Member , IEE? proposed a novel, exact border-  based approach that provides an optimal solution for the hiding of sensitive frequent item sets by 1) minimally extending the original database by a synthetically generated database part?the database extension, 2) formulating the creation of the database extension as a constraint satisfaction problem, 3) mapping the constraint satisfaction problem to an equivalent binary integer programming problem, 4)exploiting underutilized synthetic transactions to proportionally increase the support of nonsensitive item sets, 5) minimally relaxing the constraint satisfaction problem to provide an approximate solution close to the optimal one when an ideal solution does not exist, and 6) using a partitioning in the universe of the items to increase the efficiency of the proposed hiding algorithm. Extending the original database for sensitive item set hiding is proved to provide optimal solutions to an extended set of hiding problems compared to previous approaches and to provide solutions of higher quality.[2] Moreover, the application of binary integer programming enables the simultaneous hiding of the sensitive itemsets and thus allows for the identification of globally optimal solutions.



III. ASSOCIATION RULE TECHNIQUES There are different types of algorithms in association rules namely:  ? A Priori algorithm ? Partition algorithm ? Pincher-search algorithm ? Dynamic item set counting algorithm ? FP-TREE growth algorithm.

A. Apriori Algorithm Apriori algorithm is the most popular algorithm to find all  the frequent sets. It makes use of the downward closure property. Apriori algorithm is a bottom-up search, moving upward level-wise in the lattice. Before   reading the database at every level it graciously prunes many of the sets which are unlikely to be frequent sets.

The apriori frequent item set discovery algorithm uses the two functions namely (candidate generation and pruning) at every iteration. It moves upward in the lattice starting from level I till level k, where no candidate set remains after pruning.[10]    B. Partition Algorithm The partition algorithm is based on the premise that the size  of the global candidate set is considerably smaller than the set of all possible itemsets. As a result if we partition the set of transactions to smaller segments such that each segment can be accommodated in the main memory, then we can compute the set of frequent sets of each of these partitions. It is assumed that these sets contain reasonably a small number of itemsets.

Privacy Preserving Data Mining Based on Association Rule- A Survey      C.  Pincer-Search Algorithm  The pincher-search computation algorithm starts from the smallest set of frequent itemsets and moves upward till it reaches the largest frequent itemset. The pincher ?search Algorithm is based on the principle of finding frequent item sets in a bottom-up manner but, at the same time, it maintains a list of maximal frequent item sets.

D.   Dynamic Itemset Counting Algorithm  The rationale of dynamic set counting algorithm is that it works like a train pruning over the data, with stops at intervals M between transactions. When the train reaches the end of transaction file, it has made one pass over the data, and it starts all over again from the beginning for the next pass.

E.   FP-Tree Growth Algorithm  The main idea of the algorithm is to maintain a Frequent Pattern Tree of the database. It is an extended prefix-tree structure, storing crucial and quantitative information about frequent sets. In this the tree nodes are the frequent items and are arranged in such a way that more frequently occurring nodes will have better chances of sharing nodes than the less frequently occurring ones. The method starts from frequent1- itemsets as an initial suffix pattern and examines only its conditional pattern base, which consists of the set of frequent items co-occurring with the suffix pattern.



IV. INTERESTINGNESS MEASURES Interestingness measure produces different results, and  experts have different opinions of what constitutes a good rule (Lenca, Meyer, Vaillant, & Lallich, 2008). The interestingness of discovered association rules is an important and active area within data mining research (Geng & Hamilton, 2006). The primary problem is the selection of interestingness measures for a given application domain. However, there is no formal agreement on a definition for what makes rules interesting.

Association rule algorithms produce thousands of rules, many of which are redundant (Li & Zhang, 2003; McGarry, 2005).

Two important measures within association rule mining are support and confidence. Support for an association rule X =>Y is the percentage of transactions in the database that contains X U Y. Confidence for an association rule (sometimes denoted as strength, or ?) X => Y is the ratio of the number of transactions that [1] contain to the number of transactions that contain X. (Dunham, 2003). In other words, support describes how often the rule would appear in the database, while confidence measures the strength of the rule.

A user establishes minimum support (minsup) and minimum confidence (minconf). Rules are then generated based on those criteria. Users can select minsup and minconf parameters before or after rule generation. An example follows. Given a database of supermarket transaction data, a rule might be generated that infers milk eggs, with support = 40% and confidence = 75%. This means that milk eggs occurred in 40% of the transactions in the database. It also  means that 75% of the time that milk occurs, so do eggs. The antecedent for this rule is milk, while the consequent is eggs.

Larger values of confidence and smaller values of support are normally selected when determining which association rules to keep. A third measure of interestingness is lift. Lift is a measure of the probability of finding the consequent in any random basket. In other words, lift ?measures how well the associative rule performs by comparing its performance to the ?null? rule? (Marakas, 2003, p. 342).

An example of an association rule is as follows. 60% of customers that purchase potato chips also purchase soda in the same transaction. Agrawal et al.'s work established a formal model for association rules and establishes algorithms that find large itemsets, confidence, and support of each rule discovered in the itemset. Association rules have been applied to a wide variety of application areas, which will be covered later in this paper. Association rule algorithms can generate thousands of rules, many of which can be redundant. These redundant rules are essentially useless, so researchers have solved this problem by defining new interestingness measures, incorporating constraints, or by designing templates to mine for restricted rules (Xu & Li, 2007). Also, a primary goal of knowledge discovery in databases is to produce interesting rules that can be interpreted by a user (Lenca et al., 2008).



V.  ASSOCIATION RULE HIDING   Recent years have seen tremendous advances in the ability to perform association rule mining effectively. Such rules often encode important target marketing information about a business. Some of the earliest work on the challenges of association rule mining for database security. Two broad approaches are used for association rule hiding: Distortion: In distortion [9], the entry for a given transaction is modified to a different value. Since, we are typically dealing with binary transactional data sets, the entry value is flipped.

Blocking: In blocking [8], the entry is not modified, but is left incomplete. Thus, unknown entry values are used to prevent discovery of association rules.

We note that both the distortion and blocking processes have a number of side effects on the non-sensitive rules in the data. Some of the non-sensitive rules may be lost along with sensitive rules, and new ghost rules may be created because of the distortion or blocking process. Such side effects are undesirable since they reduce the utility of the data for mining purposes. A formal proof of the NP-hardness of the distortion method for hiding association rule mining. The techniques are proposed for changing some of the 1-values to 0-values so that the support of the corresponding sensitive rules is appropriately lowered. The utility of the approach was defined by the number of non-sensitive rules whose support was also lowered by using such an approach. This approach was extended in which both support and confidence of the appropriate rules could be lowered. In this case, 0-values in       the transactional database could also change to 1-values. In many cases, this resulted in spurious association rules (or a ghost rule) which was an undesirable side effect of the process. A complete description of the various methods for data distortion for association rule hiding. Another interesting piece of work which balances privacy and disclosure concerns of sanitized rules may be found in [8].

The attractiveness of the blocking approach is that it maintains the truthfulness of the underlying data, since it replaces a value with an unknown (often represented by ???) rather than a false value. Some interesting algorithms for using blocking for association rule hiding. The work has been further extended in [11] with a discussion of the effectiveness of reconstructing the hidden rules. Another interesting set of techniques for association rule hiding with limited side effects. The objective of this method is to reduce the loss of non-sensitive rules, or the creation of ghost rules during the rule hiding process .It has been discussed how blocking techniques for hiding association rules can be used to prevent discovery of sensitive entries in the data set by an adversary.

In this case, certain entries in the data are classified as sensitive, and only rules which disclose such entries are hidden. An efficient depth-first association mining algorithm is proposed for this task [8]. It has been shown that the methods can effectively reduce the disclosure of sensitive entries with the use of such a hiding process.



VI. ANALYSIS OF PAPER  Data mining can extract important knowledge from large data collection. Association rule mining is a category of data mining tasks that correlate a set of items with other sets of items in a database. The main purpose of this method is fully supporting security of database and keeping the utility and certainty of mined rules at highest level. In recent years, advances in hardware technology have lead to an increase in the capability to store and record personal data about consumers and individuals. This has lead to concerns that the personal data may be misused for a variety of purposes. In this paper various communities such as the database community, the statistical disclosure control community and the cryptography community techniques are discussed. Now a day?s Privacy preserving data mining has becoming an important factor in association rule mining which has been used in various fields for its efficiency and security.



VII. CONCLUSIONS  Privacy becomes an important factor in data mining so that the sensitive information is not revealed after mining. But the data quality is important such that no false information is provided and the privacy is not jeopardized. Association rule is one category of data mining technique. Other data mining techniques should also be considered for securing both data and knowledge. In future we will give privacy preserving data mining based on association rule using Tabu search optimization technique.
