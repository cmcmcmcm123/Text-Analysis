P2P Architectures for Distributed Online Social Networks

Abstract?Online Social Networks (OSNs) tipically exploit logically centralized infrastructure. The centralized nature of OSNs has several drawbacks including scalability, privacy, and dependence on a provider. Specifically, OSN privacy has become a major concern, particularly privacy and protection from massive data-mining and big-brotherly treatment of the users by the social networking service providers. In contrast to centralized OSNs, a distributed online social network helps to lower the cost of the provider drastically, and allows better control of user privacy.

This has several consequences: in terms of privacy, no central data collection, nor any central entity that decides or changes the terms of service. In this paper we focus on the definition of P2P Distributed Online Social Network (DOSN) paradigm and propose a new approach to P2P DOSN based on Dunbar?s number, which bounds the number of people one knows and keeps social contacts with.

I. INTRODUCTION  Online Social Networks (OSNs) have become a common ground where people are generating and consuming huge amount of information. There has been a large growth in the number of providers of such OSNs and user?s data are scat- tered over them. The currently popular OSNs are centralized which means they are based on centralized servers storing all the information. In this way, users have less control over their own data and their data is scattered over the internet in different OSN providers which usually do not support data interoperability. Centralized social networking services present several problems that include both technical and social issues that emerge as a consequence of a centralized management of the services. On the technical side, the centralized management of a social network with rapid growth in user popularity has led to various performance scalability issues. Along with the increasing popularity of the services comes the increasing cost  of managing and maintaining the infrastructures to ensure a smooth continuation and reasonable performance of the provided services. On the social side, the fast growth of the networking sites, without proper privacy preserving schemes, leads to a collapse in social context, for instance, the user?s information are shared by too many unwanted contacts. The rupture of trust between the users and the site providers were also among the key problems leading to the collapse of such early social networking services.

A current trend for developing online social network services is towards the decentralization of the OSN infrastructure. In the last years, the P2P environment has been proposed as support for Online Social Network. The inherent nature of how people connect with each other in a social network makes P2P architectures suitable for building distributed OSNs. A distributed online social network (DOSN) [1] is an online social network implemented on a distributed information management platform, such as a network of trusted servers, P2P systems or an opportunistic network. By decentralizing OSNs, the concept of a service provider is changed, as there is no single provider but a set of peers that take on and share the tasks needed to run the system. This has several consequences: in terms of privacy and operation, no central entity that decides or changes the terms of service exists.

Moving from a centralized web service to a decentralized system also means that different modes of operations be- come possible: using one?s own storage or cloud storage, delay-tolerant social networks, and local treatment of local content, to name some of them. Decentralizing the existing functionalities of online social networks requires finding ways for providing robustness against churn, distributing storage of data, propagating updates, defining an overlay topology and a protocol enabling searching and addressing, etc. The problem of dynamism is related to two types of dynamism:     social and infrastructure dynamism. The social dynamism is present in social relationships due to the variation of relations between users and of the number of users of the DOSN. The infrastructure dynamism is related to the underlying overlay network. Nodes may join/leave the underlying network, so that the corresponding user has a state that indicates its availability (online/offline). Moreover, a social graph used to model OSNs can be very large. Mapping a social graph onto a distributed network can be very expensive due to the number of social links for each node, so the cost of mirroring the social network links into distributed network links can be prohibitively high.

And it can be very inefficient, because as discussed previously, most of the social links are inactive (two friends who rarely interact online). Another important requirement is related to the data availability and the information diffusion. Data should be stored at some nodes to be always available. The main question is about where data should be stored, for instance exclusively at nodes run by friends, or at random nodes, or at particular nodes that provide a Social Cache mechanism [2]. Nodes should be connected according to their social connections in order to cluster friends in the overlay network.

This should facilitate operations as information diffusion or data storage and each update or profile from one user must be diffused to all its social connections. Another requirement is related to how a user can find its friends in the P2P overlay, and how can they discover new friends by virtue of common interests. Over multiple sessions, peers may change their physical address. However friends and trust links of a social network are essential, and so it is crucial both to be able to find back friends even if they have changed their physical address, and also to authenticate the identity. From the security perspective, keeping control over own data implies the need for security support, so that the classical requirements for security should be refined to consider the context of DOSN.

We propose a new approach for Distributed Online Social Networks based on the Dunbar?s number in which we study and evaluate all the problems inherent to the decentralization.

We consider an underlying system including also mobile P2P connections to take advantage of geographic proximity and its correlation with the interests of the users.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents related works on Distributed Online Social Networks.

While section III describes in detail our approach.



II. RELATED WORK  Several projects such as Diaspora [3], LifeSocial.KOM [4], PeerSon [5], Safebook [6], and Supernova [7] have addressed privacy in OSNs either through cryptography, architectural modifications and decentralization. Most of the proposed projects exploit a DHT based architecture. Diaspora is a really used social network in which users? profiles are hosted on servers that are administrated by individual users, without support for encryption. LifeSocial.KOM [4] is a P2P plat- form for secure online social networks which provides the functionality of common online social networks in a totally  distributed and secure manner. LifeSocial is designed to create a modular plugin-architecture to assure extensibility and the plugins are hosted on a general platform for P2P application.

PeerSoN [5] is a distributed infrastructure for social networks that provides encryption and direct data exchange. PeerSoN has a two-tier architecture, where one tier serves as a look- up service and the second tier consists of peers and contains user data, such as user profiles. This approach pays attention to security and privacy concerns. Safebook is a decentralized and privacy preserving online social network which is composed of three major different components, the TIS (Trusted Identi- fication Service), Matryoshkas which are specialized overlays encompassing each user, and a P2P location substrate based on Kademlia. In [7], a recent approach based on a Super-Peer architecture is shown. The system uses Super-Peers, which are nodes with a higher degree of bandwidth, storage space and higher availability, to manage DOSNs.



III. OUR PROPOSAL  A. A new approach for DOSNs  The evaluation of the interactions between friends in cen- tralized social networks shows that they may have different characteristics. This confirms an observation made by Dunbar [8] on offline social networks. The Dunbar?s number [9] is a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships. These are relationships in which an individual knows who each person is, and how each person relates to every other person. Authors assert that numbers larger than this generally require more restrictive rules, laws, and enforced norms to maintain a stable, cohesive group. The Dunbar?s number defines the number of people one knows and keeps social contact with, and it does not include the number of people known personally with a conclused social relationship, nor people just generally known with a lack of persistent social relationship, a number which might be much higher and which depends on long- term memory size. Dunbar introduces also the concept of ego network [8] as a social network built on a user (ego) and composed by the user and its social relationships with other users (alters). Ego networks are an important subject of in- vestigation in anthropology, as several fundamental properties of social relationships can be characterized by studying them.

In particular, it has been shown that in (offline) ego networks there are a series of circles of alters arranged in a hierarchical inclusive sequence based on an increasing level of intimacy [10].

Dunbar et al. identify four layers [10]: ?support clique?, ?sympathy group?, ?affinity group? and ?active network? with the average size of 5, 12, 35, 150 respectively (figure 1). The support clique includes alters with a very strong relationship with the ego. Each subset includes all the relationships of the previous circles along with an additional set of social links with a weaker level of intimacy. The last set contains simple acquaintances, with a relatively weak relationship with the ego.

Figure 1. The Dunbar Circles.

The scaling factor of the size of the ego network is almost constant, and very close to three. Ego networks alone cannot provide a complete representation of human social networks.

Indeed they do not capture the mutual relationships between the alters or, in other words, the correlation between different ego networks. This gap can be filled by connecting ego net- works together in order to form a complete social network. A complete representation of social network taking into account Dunbar relationship is shown in [11]. Recently, [12] has empirically verified the presence of Dunbar?s number in OSN like Facebook. The authors analyse a data set containing more than 23 million social interactions in Facebook. They extract the frequency of contacts from the ego networks in the data set. Then, they apply different clustering techniques on the distributions of the frequency of contacts of the different ego networks. The typical number of circles in the structure of a virtual ego networks is, on average, equal to 4 and the average scaling factor between the concentric circles of the social structure is close to 3, as found in offline social networks.

To model the strength of contacts self-defined by the user, we must refine the graph modelling the social relations and we call this graph the interaction graph. In this case the network is modelled by a direct and weighted graph G = (V,E), where V is the set of the users and E is the set of the social interactions between the users. Each link has a weight pi,j , which is the effective relevance of the interaction between i and j.

B. Our proposal  The main challenge of our proposal is to define a P2P network where the overlay is based on the interaction graph previously described. With a Dunbar-based P2P network, each node has a view which contains its neighborhood and the link with each neighbor is weighted by the relation?s weight. We have investigated how the Dunbar-based approach may help us to resolve the main problems of a DOSN.

? Topology, Scalability. In our P2P network each node has an own ego network. The union of the ego networks of all nodes composes the entire P2P Dunbar-based overlay.

In detail, each node has a multi-circles topology in which each circle contains a subset of the node?s view in respect to the weight of the relation, as shown in figure 1. The  limitation in the number of nodes cointained in the view permit us to deal with the network scalability.

? Dinamicity, Data Availability/Persistency, As far as con- cerns social dynamism, we need some mechanisms to evaluate the interactions of the users to understand pos- sible variations of the weight of a relation between an ego and alters. Our final goal is to define distributed al- gorithms to analyze the variations in term of interactions weight and so, to change the network structure. As far as concerns the infrastructure dynamism, the problem is related to the persistency of data of a single user when the corresponding node leaves the network. An interesting mechanism, discussed in section I, is that of Social Cache [2]. A social cache permits to save information about users as user profiles or updates, when a user decides to go offline, and to alleviate the node- to-node traffic of a DOSN. With particular techniques, that include the trustworthiness and the security related to the connections with these social caches, users choose some friends as Social Caches. Our goal is also to exploit proper distributed algorithms for balancing load of social caches.

? Search, Addressing and Updates diffusion. Focusing on a single node, known as ego, and considering a single ego network, the information must be diffused through the neighborhood organized into circles, as discussed previosly. The neighborhood is also characterized by a different importance due to the number of interactions about the ego and alters. In particular, an information or update is more important for the inner circle than the others. Information diffusion protocols must choose peers according to the importance of the interaction (the weight of a link). This solution is justified as discussed in the section III-A (Dunbar?s circles). It has been recently shown that people characterized by a high degree of interaction are also characterized by shared interests. Be- cause of this, in our approach, a Dunbar-based structure is exploited for retrieving information interesting for the user.

? Security. The underlying network permit us to manage trusted connections. In fact, each node is owner of its data, but replication of them on other nodes implies a trusted mechanism. Using the Dunbar-based overlay, we know the weight of the interactions and so, the weight of the trustness between two peers.

? Physical Locality. When considering mobile opportunis- tic networks, further forms of information diffusion may be investigated. Using mobile phones, we can keep track of how many times a user has met another one, and the duration of the contact. Also, when the nodes are mobile devices, moving in the physical environment, they may come into contact with other mobile devices. Assuming that each peer knows the interests of its neighbors, the module can ensure that the peers can retrieve useful in- formation for themselves and for their neighbors and can exchange them within the DOSNs or opportunistically in     case of contact between two devices.



IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  We have proposed a Dunbar-based P2P Network to resolve the main problems of a DOSN. We have studied real datasets which show that a Dunbar-based structure is present in popular Online Social Networks like Facebook and Twitter. This study is our first step towards understanding how to organize the P2P overlay structure. We are investigating a distributed algorithm to compute the betweenness centrality which will be used to define social caching strategies in our approach.
