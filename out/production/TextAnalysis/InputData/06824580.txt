I. INTRODUCTION  With the rapid development of Internet, social networking, mobile applications become increasingly hot, as we can see,the amount of data in the network information increase rapidly, big data which is as a new concept of data and information carrier is defined.The explosive growth of data allows us to enter the era of large-scale data analysis, which is characterized by computationally intensive and requires large-scale concurrent storage and processing capabilities. How to extract valuable information  from the mass of data quickly, timely and effectively is the urgent problem to solve.

There are two kinds of mainstream technologies about Large-scale data analysis currently: (1) in the 1980s,Teradata and Gamma's research projects which was as the represent of parallel database developed gradually,is was composed by a series of operators.The output stream of the former operator is the next operator's input stream.Record passed these operators sequentially by the way of pipeline.As a result,their method had high performance. (2) Parallel computing framework about a "shared-nothing" simple functional programming is composed of Distributed File System GFS,it supports hundreds of millions of searches every day.Apache's Hadoop is an open source implementation of Map Reduce.But these large-scale data processing technology is difficult to meet real-time requirements, and more for off-line data processing.Literature[2] analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of these two techniques,architectural differences and similarities.Hadoop is more of a ETL tool,the relationship between the two is complement rather than compete.

Jun Zhuang Information Security Laboratory, Nanjing University of  Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing 210003, Jiangsu Province, P. R. China  zhuangjun_1988@126.com   On the other hand,the Guttman [3] proposed a dynamic index structure based on R-Tree and R-Tree variants [4].Its insertion, query and other operations can be performed simultaneously, and at the same time it supports multi-dimensional model. The advantage of the manner is obvious in many spatial indexing techniques .

However, with the tree height increasing, the query node overlap increases in large-scale data processing,which resulted in rapid decrease in query efficiency.

This article presents a kind of mass data real-time query model based on dynamic index DC-Tree, this model can not only achieve efficient parallel processing in large-scale data ,but also improve the real-time effectiveness of data.



II. RELATED WORK  A. Z Curve    Figure 1. An order curve   Figure 2. 2nd order curve  Z Curve belongs to a space-filling curve, and its role is to map high-dimensional spatial data to one dimension, the relationship is one to one correspondence. The simplest Z Curve is shown in Figure 1.In order to construct a k-Z Curve,the  each grid in the simplest Z Curve should be replaced by (k-1) order Z Curve .2nd order curve shown in Figure 2.

Definition 2-1 Z Curve is defined as one-one mapping between the n-dimensional space nR  and one-dimensional space A, it can be written as Z ARn ? .

If the point nRp ? , then the item ApZ ?)( , also the item  )( pZ  is referred to as the point p?s Z value.

B. Bloom Filter  Bloom filter is a space-efficient and low lookup time complexity method , its storage space and insertion/query time are constant.It is widely used in spell checking, and database systems.

The initial state, Bloom Filter is a set of bits containing m bits, each bit sets 0. As shown below:     DOI 10.1109/CBD.2013.8     Figure 3. Bloom Filter initialization state  To express S = {x1, x2, ..., xn} such a set of n elements, Bloom Filter use k independent hash functions (Hash Function), each element of the collection is mapped to {1 , ..., m} of the range. For any element x, the position of HF mapped by the i-th hash function will be set to 1 (1  i  k). As shown in Figure 3.

Figure 4. Bloom Filter hashing process  In determining whether y belongs to the set,y is applied to the k-th hash function , if all HF positions are 1 (1  i  k), y is considered the element in the set or just a false positive (since Bloom Filter has a certain error rate), or that y is not the elements of the collection.

Judgmental process shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5. Bloom Filter judgmental proces  C. DC-Tree  DC-Tree is a dynamic index structure, it is mainly composed of the data node, directory node and super node.

A minimum MDS (minimum description subset) is a guide of indexing. The following will show several relevant and important concepts about DC-Tree.

1) Concept hierarchy A multi-dimensional data set contains several  functional properties, a data set is grouped into different dimension based on different attribute characteristics.A multi-dimension data set can be seen as a spatial array,the array element contains the respective multi-dimension data set and its corresponding dependency attribute value.If there are multiple functions in each dimension attributes,these attributes are organized by hierarchical structure.A concept hierarchy is a instance of hierarchy model.Figure 6 shows an example:customer dimension and its functional attribute including regional, national, and customer ID.ALL is the root of the conceptual level, representing all the conceptual hierarchy values.

Figure 6. Customer dimension hierarchy model and concept hierarchy  model  2) multi-dimension data set We define a multidimensional (n) data set D,each of its dimensions is called domain Di,m is a value of its dimension dependency attribute.Then D can be expressed in the following form:  mnDDD ????? ...1   (1)  A data in multi-dimension data set is called data record, a data record performance in the form of; ),...,,,...,( 11 mn xxaa ,and the  ??? jii xDa , .DC-Tree stores each dimension in concept hierarchy,and distribute ID to each dimension's attribute,which is in order to reduce information redundancy caused by storing character strings.DC-Tree manage its concept hierarchy dynamically,Every time of the update is on the basis of attribute value ID of inserting record.ID structure is shown in Figure 7,the ID structure is only 4 bytes in length,and the first four bits indicate the concept hierarchy height.

Figure 7. ID structure  3) MDS (minimum description subset) Define the n-dimensional data set D,Di is a assemble  of each field.let DS ? ,so that S is a subset of D,for example a assemble of data records,the form of data record is ),...,,,...,( 11 mn xxaa ,the ??? jii xDa , .S is the smallest MDS (minimum description subset),it is such a sequence: ),...,( 1 nMM ,the ii DM ? ,this sequence must meet the following two conditions:  For all Sxxaa mn ?),...,,,...,( 11 ,and all i, ni ??1 ,there is ii Mm ? ,established that ii ma ? .

If there is ),...,( 1 nNN ,and ii DN ? ,meeting the above coverage conditions,then for all i, ni ??1 ,and  ii Mm ? ,there is ii Nn ? ,established that ii nm ? .

After defining MDS,MDS's several important  operations are defined.These are very important in the corresponding algorithms about DC-Tree.The following will list detailedly.

N-dimensional data set D Di is a assemble of each field.There is a minimum description subset ),...,( 1 nMM ,and ii DM ? .There is also another minimum description subset ),...,( 1 nNN ,and  ii DN ? . || S  represents power of a assemble.

N contains M, if for every dimension i, ni ??1 ,there  is ii Nn ? ,established that ii nm ? .

The volume of M is defined as :  ||)(  i  n  i MMvolume  = ?=    (2)  Overlap of M and N is expressed as overlap(M,N), its     definition is:  ||),(  ii  n  i NMNMoverlap ??=  = (3)  Expansion of M and N is expressed as extension(M,N), its definition is:  ||),(  ii  n  i NMNMextension ??=  = (4)  It is noteworthy that, Mi and Ni's element in each dimension i must belong to the same level at the Concept hierarchy when operating the overlap and extension, otherwise the operation is of no significance.



III. QUERY MODEL  A. Real-time query model system In this paper, dynamic index structure DC-Tree is used  to construct our real-time query model, the model system is shown in Figure 3.1. This paper uses the distributed architecture system theory, and the ideological structure is simpler and more efficient for processing massive data.In this model, the node type will be divided into MasterNode and DataNode. The difference is that, MasterNode is responsible for data query/update location, and DataNode is responsible for storaging specific data as well as creating dynamic index in each storage.

Figure 8. Real-time query model system  Construction and application of the real-time query model system is divided into two areas: (1) The building of real-time query indexing. (2) Query of real-time indexing.A detailed description of the construction of the index will be launched in the fourth quarter of this paper.Real-time index query has two main steps:  a)  The user sends a query to the MasterNode,MasterNode will handle the query content with the Z curve and Bloom Filter operations to determine which part of the DataNode is the query on,and submit these satisfactory DataNode to the user.After the operation,the user will be disconnected to MasterNode and initiative to visit submitted DataNode for querying.

b)  The user to obtain the satisfactory DataNode for the platform,parallel query will be carried out on dynamic index structure(DC-Tree) of these DataNodes.Since each DataNode results on DC-Tree index is only part of the query results,the eventual result returned to the user should be polymerized by all part results.

B. real-time query process The system structure of Real-time query has been  elaborated in 3.1, this section will detail the process of decomposition of queries.Process can be divided into three steps:  a) multi-dimensional data record is calculated by the way of Z curve in order to achieve the purpose of dimension reduction.

b) Take the method of Bloom Filter to select the desired query DataNode through the dimensionality reduction of one-dimensional data.

c) According to b) selected DataNode,parallel DC-Tree Dynamic index will be conducted.Then the aggregated results are returned to the user.The process of real-time query system is shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9. Real-time query model process  1) Detailed step decomposition process is as follows:  a) MDS (minimum description subset) decomposition  Manifestation of MDS (minimum description subset) is )( ,...,1 dMM ,and ii DM ?  .Assuming that },...,{ 2,1 ikiii aaaM = ,and iik Dadi ??? ,1 Then the corresponding multi-dimensional data record set of MDS (minimum description subset of)is : )},...,,(),...,,...,,{( 2112111 dkkkd aaaaaa ,marked MM.

b)   Z curve dimensionality reduction  According to step a)'s results set MM, using Z Curve dimension reduction algorithm operation.Setting the Z     Curve mapping function ),,( nmpf z ,and MMp ? .m is the order of Z Curve, and n is the number of dimensions in multidimensional model. Assuming that the mapping function zf  returns a value py ,The pseudo-code about mapping function calculation process is as follows:   Step1. 0=py ; REPEAT REPEAT  Step2. ji  jin pp ayy  1)1(2 ?+?+= UNTIL nj ? UNTIL mi ?  Step3. RETURN py As the space complexity of n-dimensional and m-order's mapping function of Z Curve is  )(nO ,therefore the above algorithm results need the n-length array to store the result set.Assuming that this result set is S.

c)  Bloom Filter Positioning  According to step b),the result set is obtained after dimensionality reduction process.At the same time,the relevant work on Bloom Filter indicate that the k hash functions should be selected firstly.There is a certain error rate in Bloom Filter itself,in order to reduce this positive errors this paper build a hash function according the Knuth argument: two hash functions and forms by the following  can be uesd to generate more hash functions :  rifHFHFHFi mod)]([ 21 ++=   (5) The ki ??1 , r is the length of Bloom Filter  array. 1HF and 2HF are two independent hash functions.When 0)( =if ,double hash function mechanism is taken, or using a hash function on the expansion mechanism.In this way maintaining the positive and error rate of the generated hash function constantly,and improves the computational efficiency of the system.

After the selecting k hash functions the data in set S is mapped,and a DataNode node set is returned.Assuming the set is NN .At the same time,NN is returned to the user.

d)  DC-Tree index and aggregate the results  According to obtained NN set in step c),user navigate to the desired indexed DataNode, then DC-Tree indexing algorithm is taken to query the DataNode.Detailed indexing algorithm will be described in Section IV.After searching on each DataNode,the index results will be sent to the final result set,assuming the result is RSet .Then polymerizing the index result set and obtaining the final query results

IV. ALGORITHM DESIGN This paper presents a indexing algorithm based on  real-time query system,which has two main components: dynamic index query algorithm and insertion algorithm.

As the number of DataNode increases, concurrent  query and insert operation will greatly reduce the probability of accessing the same node.However,there is still an access violation which will as well as leads to lapse.To address this problem,this paper improves the DC-Tree index structure and propose a kind of access lock mechanism.More specifically,DataNode will be locked into the protected status of the node when it is accessed,and the follow-up visits will wait until the node unlocked.

A. Parallel Query Algorithm The proposed algorithm for parallel query algorithm  begins with the DC-Tree root node of each DataNode from top to bottom, and each result data of DataNode data will be aggregated finally.The process is as follows:  Parallel Query function:PARALLEL QUERY (PQ) INPUT:necessary inquiries _MDS (minimum  description subset) OUTPUT: the aggregation of  query result set  Step1. for all nodes in NN set,if the node is not locked,all nodes in NN will be concurrently accessed.

Step2. Let D to be the inquiry DC-Tree root node.

Step3. Apply for lock for the root node D.

Step4. For every child node C in D,if the query is not  in the same dimension _MDS level in any one dimension of C,the lower dimension of both will be converted to  a higher level of the dimension hierarchy.

Step5. If C's MDS is included in the query _MDS , then the MDS and Measure values will be added to the result set.

Step6. If there is overlap between C'MDS and the query _MDS ,and C'MDS is not included in the query _MDS.Then set the child node C as D,and query function PARALLEL QUERY will be recursively called.Going to PQ1 and proceed.

Step7. If C is a leaf node, then the end of the visit.

Step8. Apply for unlock for the root node D.

Step9. Aggregate the result sets of all accessing nodes  in NN set,and obtain the final query results.

B. Dynamic insertion algorithm This paper presents a dynamic insertion algorithm  which combines X-Tree's super node and the meaning of concept hierarchy,and at the same time combining the access lock mechanism.In this way,the problem about efficiency of dynamic insertion,split balance and access effectiveness is solved greatly.Detailed process of dynamic insertion algorithm is as follows: a) Dynamic Insert Function: DYNAMICALLY INSERT (DI)  INPUT: data record Data Record, denoted by DR Step1. Let D be the root node of inserted DC-Tree.

Step2. Apply for lock for the root node D.

Step3. Update the directory node?s Measure values.

Step4. If the DR is only contained in one of MDS of D  's child, then let D be set for this directory child node.

Step5. If the DR in contained in multiple MDSs of  D'child,then find out the child which contains minimum     data nodes in these children,and D is set to the directory child node.

Step6. If the DR is not contained in any of MDS of the D'child,firstly copy D and set copy D'.DR is added to each child node of D,and calculate the new overlapping values.Then select the child node which has the minimum value of overlapping,and set it D.

Step7. Insert the data records DR into the D and updates the value of D Measure.

Step8. If D has reached the maximum accommodation space, then call splitting function SPLIT, the D is passed as a parameter.

Step9. Update Measure and MDS of D?s father node.

Step10. Let D point to the D's parent node , if D is not  updated or is not a root, then go DI6 and continue.

Otherwise it ends.

Step11. Apply for unlock for the root node D.

b)  Split function: SPLIT (SP) Step1. Node required to be splitted contains multiple  MDSs,choose the smallest dimension of the concept hierarchy in all MDSs elements as a separatist,denoted SplitDimension.

Step2. Calculate each pair's overlap of MDSs,selecte the maximum pair as seed of the two groups.

Step3. For remaining MDS in MDSs,separate them into two groups, calculate SplitDimension extension values (extension) on the split dimension,select the extension's biggest MDS.

Step4. MDS selected in SP3 are added to two groups,calculate the overlap value,select the value of the smaller overlap and add MDS to the group.

Step5. If there in any MDS in MDSs,means that group is not yet complete,go to SP3 and continue.

Step6. If separate two groups are unbalanced or overlap value is too high,select the next best split dimension SplitDimension.

Step7. If all dimensions are selected, the split effect has not yet reached a good state,upgrade this node to super node to solve balance problems.



V. EXPERIMENTS AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS  A. Description of experimental environment Goal of this paper is to design a model for fast  indexing queries in large data.In the design of experiment,MatLab7.0 is used to simulate the data model and behavior. Detailed experimental environment is: set the memory page size of 512KB,choose DC-Tree which has the dimension of 3,set DataNode number be 10.This experiment mainly focus on the compare and simulation in area of timeliness of inserting data and querying data.

B. Model Performance-Comparative analysis in insertion time performance The number of data records inserted in experimental  is between 2000 to 20,000,Z Curve and Bloom Filter processing should be conducted before inserting.In this  way,the process will loss of part of the time,and insertion time of a few data records will be longer than insertion time of a single point.As the data record continuously increases and splitting probability of a single point occurs rapidly,the splitting time increases.At the same time,data records are parallelly allocated and inserted in this model,each DataNode loads balancing.DC-Tree will not increase as fast as a single point,then the split has less affection.As a result,the model improve the performance of the insertion time which is shown in Figure 10.

Figure10. Insertion time performance comparison  C. Model Performance-Comparative Analysis of query time performance To test the query performance on the index,the  number of data record is set between 2000 to 20,000.

Data record which is randomly generated to query every time will cause accidental probability.For querying on different data sets,the average query time of 100 data records randomly generated is used as the current query time,and performance comparison is based on this method.Query time performance comparison is shown in Figure 11.

Figure11. Query time performance comparison  As shown in Figure 11,MDS should be split to query in the initial model,and result set must be merged after querying in each DataNode based on the parallel mechanism.These two reasons resulting in a high query time when there is a a small data set.With the increasing data sets,the overlap in single point of MDS become more,and multi-path traversal query add a lot of time-consuming.However,this model uses concurrent multi-point query,and increasing of query time is not     obvious.As a result,the model achieve a better query effect.

D. Complexity Analysis To check the time complexity, for example, the time  complexity of the model consists of three parts. The first part comes from the Bloom Filter, because it uses a hashing approach, so the average time complexity is reduced to )1(1O . The second part is the mapping process from the Z Curve, time complexity of k-dimensional and m-order about Z Curve function is )(2 kO , and the k is the length of the array. The third part comes from the dynamic query process based on improved DC-Tree in structure, the complexity of data set is decided by the number of element-N, so as )(log3 NO .In summary, the time complexity of the process is:  )(log)()1(),( 321 NOkOONkO ++=       (6)  In particular, as the size of data and the dimension of the data increases,combining advantages of the hierarchical structure and the linear structure , the model greatly reduces the overlap between the MBR problems and improves the efficiency of the query.



VI. CONCLUSIONS This article presents a kind of mass data real-time  query model based on dynamic index DC-Tree which is a kind of dynamic multi-dimensional index structure.In this way,the model resolve the problem of lagged query and analysis for massive data,especially for multi-dimensional data sets.AS the data model is based on concept hierarchy,the effectiveness of real time in decision-making on large data sets is greatly improved.

Certainly,since the concurrent query and insertion mechanism are utilized in the model, it remains future work to solve the problem of conflict between the two more effectively.
