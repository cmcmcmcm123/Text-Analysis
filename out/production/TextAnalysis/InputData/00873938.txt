Scalable Data Mining with Log Based Consistency DSM for  High Performance Distributed Computing

Abstract  Mining the large web based online distributed databases to discover new knowledge and financial gain is an important research problem. These computa- tions require high performance distributed and paral- /el computing environments. Traditional data mining techniques such as classification, association, c1uste.r- ing can be extended to find nezu eflcient solutions.

This paper presents the scalable data mining prob- lem, proposes the use of software DSM (Distributed Shared Memory) with a new mechanism as an effec- tive solution and discusses both the implementation and performance evaluation results.

I t  is observed that the overhead of a software DSM is very large for  scalable data mining programs. A new Log Based Consistency (LBC)  mechanism, especially designed for  scalable data mining on the software DSM is proposed to overcome this overhead. Traditional as- sociation rule based data mining programs frequently modify the same fields by count-up operations. In con- trast, the L B C  mechanism keeps up the consistency by broadcasting the count-up operation logs among the multiple nodes.

1. Introduction  Discovering knowledge from large databases is well known as data  mining. The basic functions of data mining include detecting, predicting and interpreting patterns in on-line databases. Data mining algorithms employ techniques from wide variety of fields such as  statistics, artificial intelligence. A popular example of data mining is seen in the retail organization. Such or- ganizations collect massive amounts of data  and create large databases with the progress in bar-code technol- ogy. One of the primary techniques used in retail orga- nizations to  discover the knowledge from the databases is Association rule based mining [l][2]. For example, the knowledge for a store layout, ?40 percent of cus- tomers who purchase baby?s diapers also purchase can- beers?, can be discovered by data mining. This discov- ered knowledge can be used to increase the profit by changing the store layout.

Knowledge need to be extracted from data bases vary from industry to  industry. Many industries are in the process of developing their own specialized data  mining techniques to satisfy their own require- ments. In general, data  mining programs must pro- cess massive amounts of data  available in primary, sec- ondary and distributed storages of ShilP(Symmetric Multi-Processor)-type high performance parallel com- puters and/or cluster-type distributed computing en- vironments.

Developing algorithms and programs that can be executed both in SMP-type parallel computers and cluster-type distributed systems is an important prob- lem in data mining. Programs and algorithms exhibit- ing such capability are scalable data  mining programs.

We propose the use of software DSM (Distributed Shared Memory) [3][4] to develop scalable data  mining programs for high performance parallel and distributed computing systems. By using the DSM, we can develop programs with shared memory programming model in- stead of message passing programming model even in  0-7695-0583-WOO $10.00 0 2000 IEEE  mailto:hirayama@yuba.is.uec.ac.jp mailto:yuba@is.uec.ac.jp   cluster-type distributed systems.

Typical da ta  mining programs based on association  rule mining frequently modify the same da ta  fields by count-up operations. When those programs are exe- cuted in software DSM, many da ta  in the fields are frequently passed among the plural nodes to keep up the consistency. Thus the overhead of a software DSM is very large for da ta  mining programs. To improve the performance we propose a new Log Based Consis- tency (LBC) mechanism, on the software DSM. This mechanism is specially designed for scalable da ta  min- ing. The  LBC mechanism keeps up the consistency by broadcasting the count-up operation logs among the plural nodes.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the LBC mecha- nism, we have developed a scalable da ta  mining sys- tem, VISIONA (Virtual Shared Memory Ehvironment for Scalable Data Miqing Applications). VISIONA is implemented as a software DSM with LBC and running in distributed systems such as PC clusters or UNIX- computer clusters. Two programs for mining, an as- sociation rule based program and a bayesian network program, have been implemented in VISIONA. Perfor- mance of the software DSM with LBC was evaluated by executing the programs in VISIONA. We selected association rule and bayesian network mining because of their popularity among users.

In this paper, we present the mechanism of the software DSM with LBC, the implementation of the LBC mechanism and the performance evaluation results of LBC mechanism for association rule based mining and bayesian network mining.

2. Large Scale Data Mining  This section describes the two large scale da ta  min- ing programs. First one is a mining program based on association rule [1][2] for retail organizations. Second mining program is the bayesian network generation [5] for the manufacturing industry.

2.1. Association Rule Mining  Association rule niining is very popular among the retail organizations. For association rule mining it is necessary to define two measures, a support value and a confidence value. The  support value is a measure based on the percentage of the transaction record including an item X. The confidence value is a measure based on the percentage of the transaction record including an  item X is also including an item Y. Users specify the constraints, the minimum support value and the mini- mum confidence value, for mining association rules.

Association rule mining is done by the following Apriori algorithm. In this algorithm k is an integer which starts from one. The  following steps process the item-sets (sets of items) having k items, which are called pass-k. They are iterated after k is increniented.

1. Read all transaction records and count-up the oc- currences of the item-sets having k items. These are the candidate item-sets of k.

2. Select the item-sets from the candidate item-sets of k, which support values which are greater than the minimum support value. They are called the large item-sets of k.

3. Make the candidate item-sets of k+ l  out of the large item-sets of k. Repeat the above steps until the large item-sets will be null.

It takes very long time to  execute the Apriori algorithm, since it reads a large number of transaction records and counts-up the occurrences of a large number of item-sets.

2.2. Bayesian Network Generation  Bayesian network, a new technique of da ta  mining, received much attention in the manufacturing indus- try. A bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph.

The network graphically represents the characteristics and the relations of knowledge with its nodes and arcs.

This graphical representation helps to understand the knowledge. Moreover, it has formal probabilistic se- mantics for statistical manipulation.

When generating a bayesian network, many event da ta  sampled from the environment such as a man- ufacturing process are read and the occurrences of the events are counted-up. I t  takes massive amount of time to  generate a bayesian network, because it reads a large number of event da ta  and counts-up the occurrences of a large number of events.

3. Log Based Consistency Mechanism  There are two types of DSMs (Distributed Shared Memory). One is a hardware DSM such as "DASH" [6] or "Alewife" [7]. Hardware DSM is one of the hardware architectures for scalable platforms. The     Node-0 Node1  Network  Figure 1. The DSM with LBC.

other is a software DSM such as "TreadMarks" [3] or "CVM" [4]. Software DSM is a technique to make a virtual scalable platform from various other platforms which may use a hardware DSM. Our proposal is to use a software DSM. We do not consider whether a hardware DSM is used in the platform or not. From now on, we refer the software DSM as a DSM.

3.1. LBC Mechanism  The DSNI provides a virtual shared memory and enables users to develop programs with shared mem- ory programming model in cluster-type distributed sys- tems. The traditional DSM such as "TreadMarks" has the lazy release consistency [3] and multiple writer pro- tocol [8]. They increase the performance compared to the former sequential consistency protocol by alleviat- ing the problem caused by mis-matches between page size and application granularity which is known as false sharing. That is, they are effective even if the fields in the same page are frequently updated in the plural nodes.

Lazy release consistency and the multiple writer pro- tocol are not sufficient for some data mining programs such as association rule mining or bayesian network generation. Those programs frequently update the same fields in the plural nodes. Therefore, if those pro- grams are executed in the traditional DSM, large num- ber of data items in the fields are frequently passed for keeping the consistency and they can not be executed simultaneouly. Such a problem is hardly alleviated by  the lazy release consistency or the multiple writer pro- tocol.

Most of the processing time of those programs is spent by the count-up operations. If we pay attention to the characteristics of the count-up operations, we notice that the operations follow the commutative law and the associative law. By taking advantage of the commutative and the associative features of the count- up operations, we propose the LBC (Log Based Consis- tency) mechanism. The LBC mechanism can execute the count-up operations simultaneously in the plural nodes while keeping the consistency.

For example, in the Apriori algorithm for mining association rules, a hash tree of the candidate item- sets is created in the DSM. After the hash tree is cre- ated in the DSM, transaction records are read and the occurrences of the item-sets are countred by all nodes.

The operations have a large overhead in the traditional DSM, because it is necessary to pass the data in the fields at every count-up operation to keep up the con- sistency. Hence, the count-up operations can not be executed simultaneously. However, the count-up oper- ations with commutative and the associative laws, it is possible to keep consistency without passing data at every count-up operation.

In the DSM with LBC, when the count-up oper- ations are executed in a node, the count-up operation logs are recorded in a log buffer of the node, as shown in figure 1. These count-up operations can be executed si- multaneously in the plural nodes without passing data a t  every count-up operation.

The count-up operation log has an address of the field which is counted-up in the node and to be counted- up in all other nodes. When the log buffer reaches full, the logs are sent to all other nodes by broadcasting. In other nodes, when they receive the logs, the logs are processed or the count-up operations are executed.

The LBC mechanism makes it possible to count-up the same fields simultaneously in the plural nodes without passing data at every count-up operation.

Therefore, the LBC mechanism is effective for the count-up operations by taking advantage of the commutative law and the associative law.

3.2. Implementation of LBC Mechanism  Figure 2 shows the system structure of VISIONA which is the prototype of the DSM with LBC. The Re- source Manager is a daemon process to manage shared meniory spaces and semaphores which can be used in cluster-t,ype distributed systems. The Space Managers are daemon processes to  manage data in shared mem-     Node-0 Node-t Node2  ~ Space Manager  Shadow Daemon  Network  Figure 2. System structure of VI- SIONA.

ory spaces and send the count-up operation logs to all other nodes by broadcasting. The Shadow Daemons are daemon processes to  receive the count-up opera- tion logs sent from other nodes and to reflect them into the shared memory spaces in their own nodes.

When an application process creates a shared niem- ory space or a semaphore, it sends the request to the Resource Manager (A).  When the Resource Manager is requested to create a shared memory space, it re- quests the Space Managers and the Shadow Daemons in all nodes to create the shared memory space and map them (B).  Semaphores are controlled by the Re- source Manager.

When an application process attaches a shared memory space into its own address space, it sends the request to the Space Manager in its own node to query the address of the shared memory space. When an application process counts-up the occurrences of the candidate item-sets in the shared memory space, it sends the request to the Space Manager in its own node (C). The Space Manager saves the count-up request as a log in a log buffer. When the log buffer reachs full, the '  Space Manager sends them to the Shadow Daemons in all other nodes by broadcasting (D). When the Shadow Daemons receive the count-up operation logs, they reflect them into their own shared memory spaces.

Figure 3 shows a pseudo code for association rule mining in the DSM with LBC. The functions with pre- fix "VISIONA" are provided by VISIONA library. In step-1, a master process creates a shared memory space and a semaphore. All the processes in the plural nodes of the cluster-type distributed system count-up the oc- curreiices of the candidate item-sets in a hash tree on the shared memory space. Synchronization is done with the semaphore.

Steps 2 through 13 are execut.ed by all the processes.

In step-2, all the processes attach the shared memory space into their own address spaces. Steps 3 through 12 show the sequence of the Apriori algorithm. This se- quence iterates with incrementing k until the candidate     item-sets of k become empty.

Steps 4 through 7 iterate for all the transaction  records. In step-4, a transaction record is read. In step-5, an item-set of k is selected from the transac- tion record. In step-6, the item-set is searched in the hash tree. In step-7, the occurrence of the item-set is count-upped.

In step-8, the count-up operation logs remained in the log buffer are flushed to all other nodes. In step-9, all the processes synchronize with the semaphore. In step-10, after completion of the pass-k, the large item- sets of k are made. In step-11, the candidate item-sets ofk+1 are made out of the large item-sets of k .  In step- 12, the variable "k" is incremented and the sequence iterates from the step-4.

When the candidate item-sets of k reach empty, the Apriori algorithm terminates. In step-13, all the pro- cesses detach the shared memory space. Finally, in step-14, the master process deletes the shared memory space and the semaphore.

This is a pseudo code for association rule mining, and it can be executed simultaneously in cluster-type distributed systems. But the code is not only for cluster-type distributed systems but also for SMP-type parallel computers.

Four uni-processor computers (rep- resented as UPS) and an SMP-type parallel computer (represented as SMP) with the following specifications are used for this evaluation.

And the SMP is also inter-connected with the UPS via the same ethernet. A data  file is stored in a local DISK of each computer in each case. The DISK performance of the UP and the SMP is different.

Figure 4 shows a pseudo code for association rule mining in the SMP. This is basically same as the code shown in figure 3. The main difference is step-7. In step-7, the occurence of the item-set is count-upped by increnienting the shared variable in a critical section with mutex-lock and mutex-unlock.

Table 1 shows the performance of association rule mining executed by the SMP and the UPS using the DSM with LBC (represented as DSM). Table 2 shows the results normalized by those of the UP. According to the results, speedup by increasing the number of processors of the DSM with LBC is greater than or equal to  that of SMP-type parallel computer. Because there are no more UPS, we use four UPS and the SMP together for further evaluation.

Table 3 shows the performance of parallel and dis- tributed system (the UPS and the SMP) using the DSM with LBC. The data  file is equally divided without con- sidering the difference of processor speed of each com- puter. The result of six processors is measured by four     main(atgc, argv) (  spacep = malloc(size);  for (i = 0; i < N; i++) (  if (!fork()) (  apriorio;  return;    apriorio;   number of  apriorio (  P Apriori algorithm 'I  k = l ;  while (candidate item sets of k-th pass are not empty) (  r step of k-th pass ' I while ((read data) != empty) (  while (item sets of k items are selectable from the data) (  search the itemset in the hash tree:  mutex_lock(&mt[fieldp % 4WD;  'fieldpt+;  mutex-unlock(&mt[fieIdp % 4001);    make the large item-sets of k by comparing the support values of the candidate itemsets with the minimum support value;  make the candidate itemsets of k+l out of the large itemsets of k;  kt t ;    pass-1 pars-2 pars-3 pass-4 total  (step-I  (step2  (step3  (step4  (step5  (step6  (step7  (step8  (step9  number of   Figure 4.

When the evaluation is done by processors with dif- ferent speeds, the final result depends on the processor with the lowest speed, if the data file is equally divided for all the processors. Compared to the processor with the lowest speed, sufficient speedup is achieved.

Table 5 shows the count-up log size and the execu- tion time when executing association rule mining. The maximum log size per time is O.SOMB/second. It is small enough compared to the transfer rate of lOMbps ethernet.

So we do not con- sider that the broadcast of the count-up logs creates a bottleneck of the performance.

Finally, we compared the performance of the DSM with LBC to  the performance of CVM. CVM is the DSM with lazy release consistency and multiple writer protocol. In this case, total number of records is only 1,000 (approximately 100KB), because of the bad per- formance of CVM.

Figure 5 shows a pseudo code for association rule mining in CVM. This is basically same as the code shown in figure 3. The main difference is step-7. In step-7, the occurence of the item-set is count-upped by increnienting the shared variable in a critical section with cvm-lock and cvm-unlock.

Table 6 shows the performance of association rule mining executed in CVM and VISIONA. It shows that CVM or the DSM with lazy release consistency and multiple writer protocol cannot get the speedup by in- creasing the number of processors. On the other hand VISIONA or the DSM with LBC can get it.

Our approach is different from the past re- search. We use DSM as a common tool for scalable data mining programs. The objective is to  develop scalable  Table 6.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the DSM with LBC, we have implemented VISIONA both in PC clusters and UNIX computer clusters. Programs of association rule mining and bayesian network generation has been also implemented in VISIONA. According to t,he results of the evaluation of the DSM with LBC, speedup by increasing the number of processors on the DSM with LBC is greater than or equal to  that of SMP-type parallel computer. In the future, we will improve the VISIONA as a DSM system with multiple consistency protocol including the LBC mechanism.

The goal is to increase the adaptability to many different da ta  mining programs.
