SIMULATIONS OF CONPOSIT,  A SUPRA-CONNECTIONIST ARCHITECTURE FOR COMMONSENSE REASONING

ABSTRACT  A computational architecture called ?Conposit? is outlined.

Conposit manipulates very-short-term complex symbolic data structures of types that are useful in high-level cogni- tive tasks such as commonsense reasoning, planning, and natural language understanding. Conposit can be straightfor- wardly implemented as a large neuralkonnectionist network, and therefore provides a way of bridging the gap between high-level cognitive information processing and neural net- works. Conposit?s data structures are, essentially, temporary configurations of symbol Occurrences in a 2D array of regis- ters. Each register is implementable as a neural subnetwork whose activation pattem realizes the symbol occurrence. The data structures are manipulated by condition-action rules that are realizable as further neural subnetworks attached to the array. In simulations, Conposit has performed symbolic pro- cessing of types previously found difficult for connectionist/neural networks. This paper concentrates on a version of Conposit, simulated on the Massively Parallel Pro- cessor, embodying core aspects of Johnson-Laird?s mental model theory of human syllogistic reasoning. This version illustrates Conposit?s power and flexibility, which arises from unusual data-structure encoding techniques called ??Relative- Position Encoding? and ?Pattem-Similarity Association?

INTRODUCTION The challenge presented to connectionism by high-level cog- nitive processing - which includes commonsense reason- ing, planning, and some aspects of natural language under- standing - is gaining increasing recognition. The main technical difficulties are listed in Refs. 1-4, 7, 8, and else- where in the connectionist literature, and include the well- known variable-binding problem and the problem of account- ing for complex, temporary, novel data structures.

Ref. 6 reports experiments with a version of Conposit that incorporates production rules for commonsense reason- ing, one of which can be paraphrased as  IF: a person X loves a person Y who  THEN: X is jealous of Z.

loves a person Z (different from X )  This exercises Conposit?s handling of variable bindings.

The version of Conposit described below engages in a  particular type of commonsense reasoning, namely syllogistic reasoning, by embodying some core aspects of the Johnson- Laird?s ?mental model? theory (Refs. 9-12). The main goal of the work was to verify that the techniques developed for other types of processing in Conposit (Refs. 4-7) were flexi- ble enough to be extended in a natud way to the distinctly different type of processing required by the mental model theory - and in fact no new features have had to be added.

Conposit is currently concemed only with short-term processing: there is no adaptive learning capability at present, and long-term memory consists entirely of the fixed set of condition-action rules (but see the suggestions in Refs. 4,7 for a long-term memory of data structures). It is closer to the ?localist? than to the ??distributed? end of the spectrum of connectionist systems.

BRIEF SKETCH OF CONPOSIT Conposit is currently defined as a computational architecture whose components can be straightforwardly implemented in connectionist terms. Details are reported in Ref. 7 (or Ref. 4 for an earlier formulation).

In Conposit, a ?Relative-Position Encoding? technique is used as the foundation for complex short-term data struc- tures. These reside in a 32x32 array of registers. This array is called the configuration matrix (CM). The values in registers are usually rapidly changing. Each register can be implemented as a small connectionist subnet that holds a dynamically changing activity pattem implementing the register?s value, and that is connected to neighboring regis- ters and other components.

A register?s value consists of a ?symbol? and a vector of binary ?highlighting flag? values. A symbol may have a specific representational function, such as denoting a particu- lar person or a particular type of relationship among people.

Any symbol can be placed in any register, and all registers   CH2649-2/89/0000/0311$01 .OO 0 1988 IEEE    have the same set of highlighting flags. Temporary srruc- ture is encoded mainly in the adjacency relationships among values in CM registers. For instance, if a register contains a symbol denoting the class of all possible situations in which one person loves another, and has a certain highlight- ing flag in the ON state, then any adjacent register that has another specific highlighting flag ON is deemed to represent, temporarily, a specific loving situation.

See, for example, the representation of the proposition that John loves Mary in the upper portion of Figure 1, which shows an 8 x 8 region of the CM.

Figure 1. ?Bill believes that John loves Mary.?  Each square stands for a register, and capitalized words and letters stand for symbols. The word JOHN stands for a symbol denoting a particular person John known to the sys- tem. The LOVE symbol denotes the class of all conceivable loving situations. The L symbol may be ignored for now.

The registers with no symbol shown contain a null symbol that does not denote anything. The denotations of symbols are considered to be borrowed by the registers they occur in at any moment: a register containing a non-null symbol denotes what that symbol denotes. Hence, in the figure there are registers that - temporarily - denote John, Mary and the love-situations class. The other signs within squares show ON states of highlighting flags, which in this example are all referred to by the names of colors. An ?r? indicates that the register is red-highlighted (i.e. the red flag is currently on); similarly ?g? for green, heart sign for white, and spade sign for black. One important function for highlighting is to help specify the representational relation- ships temporarily holding between adjacent registers. For instance, a white-highlighted register is deemed to denote a member of the class denoted by any neighboring black-  highlighted register. Therefore the upper white register in the figure denotes some love situation. Further, if a register denotes a love situation, then any adjacent red register (here, the one containing JOHN) denotes the ?lover? and any adja- cent green one (here, the one containing MARY) denotes the ?lovee?. Note that the absolute positions of the symbols and highlighting states are irrelevant, as are the directions of the adjacency relationships.

Complex data structures can be split up into pieces by a shared-symbol association technique. Shared-symbol associ- ation relies on the stipulation that two registers containing the same symbol are considered to represent the same entity.

The real power comes from the sharing of variable-like ?unassigned symbols?. By appearing within a data struc- ture, an unassigned symbol can be viewed as having a tem- porary denotation dictated by the role of the symbol in the structure. The letter ?L? in Figure 1 indicates an unassigned symbol, which temporarily comes to name the hypothetical loving situation by being in the white-highlighted register in the loving-subconfiguration. The Figure shows how the pro- position that Bill believes that John loves Mary can be encoded by two separate register-value subconfigurations that are linked by the sharing of the L symbol.

In this shared-symbol association technique, two or more registers contain the same symbol, and to that extent contain similar activity patterns at the connectionist level of description. The notion of similarity here is simple and all- or-none (i.e. not graded), but other versions of the technique could be based on more sophisticated, and perhaps graded, notions of similarity of connectionist activity patterns.

Shared-symbol association is thus a simple instance of the class of ?Pattern-Similarity Association? techniques, which are discussed briefly in Ref. 6.

The processing of the short-term data structures in the CM is performed by internal ?circuitry? (i.e. system com- ponents that are mapped straightforwardly into a connection- ist implementation) mediating mainly neighbor-neighbor interaction within the CM, and external ?circuitry? outside the CM but attached to it. The extemal circuitry embodies ?hardwired? condition-action processing rules. Rules can detect particular configurations of symbols and highlighting states in the CM by means of highly parallel detection circui- try that involves further two-dimensional register arrays iso- morphic to the CM (Refs. 4,7), and can in response send complex sequences of signals to the CM. A rule can embody conditionals testing the CM state, loops, and a sim- ple, form of non-recursive routine calling. A rule operates on the CM in a highly SIMD, register-local, parallel fashion: each action on the CM is performed by sending to each register an identical ?command signal? in parallel, whereu- pon different registers change state differently, according to their own current states and those of their immediate neigh- bors.

A command signal can have one of a number of effects, such as making each register that has specified highlighting flags ON or OFF change the states of some flags, and/or accept a new symbol value, andor broadcast its symbol value     to the other registers (via a central relay station attached to the CM and called the Parallel Distributor). It is also possi- ble for a signal only to have an effect on a single, randomly chosen register with specified highlighting, rather than on each such register. A command signal may also require that, for a register to respond, either some or all of its neighboring registers be in a specified highlighting state. Refs. 4, 7 detail how the signals can be used to process data structures, and, in particular, to find free space for, and then create, new data structures in the CM.

A tentative mapping of the model to connectionist net- works that appear to be biologically reasonable is sketched in Refs. 4, 7. In particular, it is suggested that the CM could be realized as a localized group of thin cortical columns. It is this suggestion that motivates the choice of dimension two and size 32x32 for the CM (see Ref. 4). A non-biological version of the approach could be based on a CM of other dimensions and sizes.

JOHNSON-LAIRD AND SYLLOGISMS Consider the syllogism  Some chemists are beekeepers.

All beekeepers are householders.

Therefore, some chemists are householders.

To simplify a little, Johnson-Laird maintains that we make such a syllogistic inference by constructing a mental model of the form illustrated in Figure 2.

Figure 2. A Johnson-Laird syllogistic mental model.

This mental model is an abstract data structure made up of ?tokens? (shown by the capital letters) and identity links between tokens (shown by the equality signs). There is an arbitrarily selected number of tokens C standing for chemists.

An arbitrarily selected proper non-empty subset are related by identity links to beekeeper tokens B, and all beekeeper tokens are so linked to householder tokens H. The parentheses in the figure indicate that the enclosed tokens are optional. The conclusion that some chemists are household- ers arises from noticing that some chemist tokens are linked by chains of equality tokens to householder tokens. There is much arbitrariness in the construction of a mental model.

For instance, the number of tokens in a particular model is arbitrarily chosen, as is the number marked as optional.

There is also leeway in how the links are placed. The mental model serves as a sort of internalized, highly abstract ?exam- ple? situation conforming to the premises of the English  syllogism. Naturally, the ?conclusion? read off from a men- tal model might merely be an artifact of the particular exam- ple it embodies, and therefore be invalid. In response to this, Johnson-Laird postulates that the system attempts to con- struct several different mental models conforming to the premises in an attempt to falsify any particular putative con- clusion before outputing it. The attempted-falsification pro- cess will fail in the present case, but should succeed if in the above syllogism contained ?some beekeepers? rather than ?all beekepers?.

Johnson-Laird?s theory is able to explain certain syl- logistic preferences, difficulties and errors exhibited by human subjects. He does not specify any implementation of mental models in neural net terms.

JOHNSON-LAIRD SYLLOGISTIC REASONING IN CONPOSIT Conposit straightforwardly represents mental models, and constructs them from propositional CM subconfigurations that encode syllogism premises. I have not yet addressed the following aspects of Johnson-Laird?s approach: (i) the understanding or generation of natural language; (ii) a thorough attempted-falsification process - the current Con- posit is given the conclusion, and merely checks its validity with a single model randomly generated from the premises; or (iii) negative premises and conclusions (?no X are Y? and ?some X are not Y?). which require special representa- tional and processing features. The correction of the last two deficiencies is not difficult, however, and will be described elsewhere.

Figure 3 shows the CM version of a syllogistic model derived from the premises in the Section 3 syllogism. The CHMS, BKRS and HHS symbols denote the classes of all conceivable chemists, beekeepers and householders respec- tively. The X1 to X7 are distinct unassigned symbols. Each Johnson-Laird ?person token? is implemented as a pair of adjacent CM registers, one of which (the black one) tem- porarily represents a class of person, and the other of which (the white one, containing an Xi symbol) represents a partic- ular though indefinite member of the class. (Recall the use of whiteblack adjacent highlighting in the love-situation representation in Figure 1). Each Xi symbol is thereby con- sidered to denote a person for the time being. The Figure shows the person tokens positioned in a regimented way, but in the actual simulation they are randomly positioned in the CM, and the white-highlighted register in each pair is a random neighbor of the black register. The function of Johnson-Laird?s identity links is taken over by symbol- sharing, which is therefore being used for its standard func- tion of making different CM registers represent the same thing. In the figure an ?s? indicates special highlighting sig- nifying that the token is optional.

Figure 3. CM version of a syllogistic mental model.

The mental model in Figure 3 is constructed from representations, analogous to the one for John loving Mary in Figure 1, of the two premises of the syllogism. These prem- ise representations are shown at the bottom left and bottom middle of Figure 4. Conposit is also given a propositional representation for the syllogism?s conclusion (bottom right of Figure 4) and checks that the mental model is consistent with this given conclusion. The OLAP and SUBC symbols denote the classes of all conceivable class-overlap situations and subclass situations respectively. The lST, 2ND and 3RD symbols are arbitrary, distinct, unassigned symbols. None of these five symbols is dedicated to syllogistic reasoning. The registers containing 1ST denote the situation of chemists overlapping with beekeepers (i.e. of some chemists being beekeepers). The registers containing 2ND and 3RD are analogously interpreted.

The construction of the mental model has two main phases. A hardwired rule called Rule-Some detects the subconfiguration for the first premise (Figure 4, botttom left), and constructs, in a another part of the CM, the chemist and beekeeper tokens in Figure 3. (It creates randomly many chemist tokens, six on average, then constructs beekeeper tokens using the same unassigned symbols as in a random subset of the chemist tokens, and, finally, randomly con- structs three extra beekeeper tokens on average.) Another, similar, rule called Rule-All detects the subconfiguration for the second premise and constructs some householder tokens with the same unassigned symbols as in the beekeeper tokens, and then constructs some extra householder tokens.

Finally, RuleSome comes into play again by detecting the subconfiguration for the conclusion (bottom right of illustra- tion) and checking that there is at least one chemist token and householder token sharing a symbol. In cases where the conclusion is invalid (such as in the amended Section 3  Figure 4. The statement of the syllogism displayed in the text.

example), Conposit sometimes does and sometimes does not construct a mental model consistent with the conclusion, because of the randomness. It would be mvial to get Con- posit to repeat the whole process in an attempt to randomly alight on a falsifying model.

Rule-Some and Rule-All work with any classes in syllo- gisms, not just the chemist, beekeeper and householder classes. There is no replication of rule circuitry for the dif- ferent classes. Achievement of this effect in a more standard type of connectionist system would cause considerable difficulty.

Ref. 4 describes versions of Rule-Some and Rule-All in complete detail. That paper also describes the rule Note-Next that fires three times, once in response to each of the propositional CM subconfigurations at the top of Figure 4. These state the order in which the premise subconfigurations are to be considered. (The THEN symbol denotes the class of all conceivable succession situations.) Note-Next moves highlighting of two special sorts around in the CM with the result that Rule-Some and Rule-AN are mg- gered in the right order.

RuleSome checks the conclusion in our example as fol- lows. It marks all the white registers in chemist and house- holder tokens with special highlighting flags ?member-of-class1 ? and ?member-of-class2? respec- tively. Part of this marking process is to spread such highlighting to all registers with the same symbol. All that is left to do is to detect the presence of some register marked with both ?member-of-class1 ? and ?member-of-class2?.

We have here a traditional marker passing process, but work- ing over highly temporary data structures.

Simulation Results Elapsed simulated time depends on values for signal-travel distances, signal-travel speeds, and combinatorial-logic delays (e.g. within CM registers) that are based on broad assumptions about how Conposit could be realized as a bio- logically reasonable neural net (Ref. 4), rather than just as an abstract connectionist net. The main parameter values are as follows:  distance between rule circuitry and the CM: 50mm long distance transmission speed: lO"/ms basic time for register's response to a signal: lOms overhead of random register selection: 5ms  The values of the last two parameters listed appeal to fast non-spike inter-neural communication in local circuits (see Ref. 4 for a discussion). Notice the long distance of 5 cen- timeters between CM and rule circuitry. The lO"/ms value appears to be about the maximum speed for transmisison of neural impulses over long distances in cortex.

The following average timings were observed over one set of twelve experiments conducted (one syllogism per experiment).

processing of a whole syllogism 2526ms detection phase of a rule 98ms a Note-Nat execution 76ms a Rule-SomelAll execution on first premise 905111s a Rule-SomelAll execution on second premise 602ms  18Oms a Rule-SomelAIl execution on conclusion  CONCLUSION The average syllogism-processing time of about 2.5 seconds seems small enough to be psychologically realistic. It is hard to discern timings for human syllogistic reasoning in Johnson-Laird's experimental reports, partly because of the need for a natural language understanding phase. The experi- ments all appear to have allowed a time much longer than two and a half seconds. E.g. in the experiments of Ref. 11 subjects were given either ten seconds or as long as they liked. According to figures of Bara (personal communica- tion), the faster human subjects work a simple syllogism in a time comparable to the two and a half seconds needed by Conposit.)  It is probably not biologically plausible for rules like Rule-Some and Rule-All to be hardwired as in the current Conposit version, partly because of the difficulty of seeing how the rule circuitry could be developed on the basis of  The power and flexibility of Conposit arises from its Relative-Position Encoding and Pattern-Similarity Association techniques for encoding data structures. These techniques arc unusual for connectionism, although the are loosely related to methods found elsewhere (see Ref. 6).
