Community Detection using an Optimized  Label Propagation Algorithm

Abstract The aim of social network analysis is to  search for implicit, previously unknown, and  potentially useful information. And community  discovery is an important method to obtain these  information. Label propagation algorithm can  provide an efficient way to discover communities in a  large-scale network .In each iteration, the label for  each vertex is replaced with the most frequent label  from its labels. However, this method will lead to  many fragmentary communities. To modify this  algorithm, we first select some influential nodes as  seeds. And then a node will choose its label based on  the summation of influences of its neighbors. Our  experiment show that the communities discovered by  the optimized algorithm is improved.

I. INTRODUCTION  A social network is the network of relationships and interactions among social  entities such as individuals, groups of individuals, and organizations[1].As a hot issue which has  been discussed by many scholars, community detection in a network is the gathering of  network vertices into groups in such a way that nodes in each groups are densely connected  inside and sparser outside. Generally speaking, when the algorithm operates on the network, the  network will be split into k communities and also the number of edges between different  communities is minimized. In most cases, the communities acquired by community detection  algorithm satisfy the following constraints: 1.C? ? C? = ?, ?i ? j 2.?? C? Spans the node set in N In the hierarchical agglomeration  algorithm[2], to sidestep the shortcomings of the hierarchical clustering method, the edge betweenness is introduced. And then this algorithm partition communities by greedily optimizing the modularity. However, one of the drawbacks of this method is that it cannot adapt to the large-scale networks.

Inspired by hops in electric circuit, Wu and Huberman algorithm[3] divides the networks into k communities of approximately equal size.

However, this algorithm requires some external parameter settings including the number and sizes of communities.

Label propagation algorithm[4] is a kind of community structure detection algorithm from the idea of percolation with superior efficiency.

When the algorithm begins, every node in the social network is initialized with a unique label.

And then, every node in the social network adopts the label that most of its own neighbors have. When the labels of all nodes are invariable, the algorithm stops. It appears that nodes in a   DOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.50    DOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.50     community are with a high density of internal links, whereas links between compartments have a comparatively lower density.

Tib?ly and Kert?sz[5] have identified the label propagation algorithm as formally equivalent to minimizing the Hamiltonian for a kinetic Potts model. Baber and Clark[6] present label propagation algorithm with the objective function and also introduced two optimized algorithms to maximize the modularity and the bipartite modularity.

Briefly, the outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we introduce label propagation algorithm(LPA) and provide the improvement method for label propagation algorithm. And then we will evaluate performance of the algorithm in Section 3.At last, we give a conclusion in the last part of this paper.



II. OPTIMIZATION OF LABEL PROPAGATION ALGORITHM  A. The Introduction of LPA  When compared with other community discovering algorithms, LPA is a linear time algorithm to detect community structures in large-scale networks. The basic idea of the algorithm is to change the label of node according  to the number of its neighbors? labels, and to choose the most labels  that  neighbors have as the new label. Firstly, every node in the network are all initialized with a unique label.

And then, in each iteration, every node will select the label occurring with the highest frequency among its neighbors. Ref[6] provides an equivalent mathematical to represent the label updating process of LPA. It is as follows:   ? = ?????? ? ?? ?(	?, 	)         (1) ?  ???  where 	? is the current label for vertex u, ?  is the new label for vertex v.The adjacency matrix ?? are all elements of {0,1}. And by construction, as the algorithm converges, nodes in a community all have same labels, which  indicates that each node has more neighbors in its own community than in any of other community.

This algorithm is easily understood and quickly implemented. During each iteration, it has a computational complexity ,which is O(m),linear in the number of edges in the graph.

By the way, the iterative process can be synchronous or asynchronous. If we update the labels synchronously, it will lead to oscillation of labels. Therefore, in Ref[4], the author decides to update the labels asynchronously. It means the label of a node will be decided not only by neighbors that have already been updated in the current iteration, but also decided by the neighbors that are not yet changed temporarily.

However, this algorithm has some drawbacks that cannot be ignored. For example, it returns different solutions (some of them of poor quality) in different realizations[7].The reason for this phenomenon is that every node in the network is initialized with a unique label.

Though the labels are updated dynamically and asynchronously, it still leads to some isolated nodes or meaningless communities, which sometimes result in the incorrect division of the whole network.

B. The Goodness of Community Division  To evaluate the community structure in networks, Newman and Girvan introduced  the modularity measure(Q value)[11], it makes a comparison between the observed density of edges within communities and the expected density of edges within the same communities in randomized networks. The value closer to 1 indicates stronger community structure. And it has been adopted as an efficient approach to measure the goodness of community division and is expressed as:  ? = ? (??? ? ???)???                 (2)  where a? represents the fraction of edges that connect to vertices in community, and ???  is applied to the observed fraction of edges within community i.

C. The Optimization of LPA  One way to modify this standard algorithm is that we initialize the feed set which contains the most influential nodes with labels in the network instead of labeling all nodes with a unique label before the iterations. It will reduce the range of possible solutions that the algorithm produce. And then instead of considering the labels occurring with the highest frequency among neighbors, we take the node influence into account during the process of label updating.

The selection of influential nodes in a network has been studied by several researchers.

In this place, we use the method introduced  in Ref[8]. It considers the problem of influential nodes selection based on the propagation speed in social network information diffusion.

Then, we use ??!	"??#?(") to represent the potential influence a node could exert to all its neighbors. It is calculated based on the on the following equation:  ??!	"??#?(") = ? $?  ?%(?)             (3)  $? is defined as the influence of an active node u exerted on one of its inactive node v[12].

To calculate this parameter, the concept of neighbor graph of a node is adopted. And the definition of neighbor graph is as follows:  &'(v) = '?(*?, +?)            (4) *? = {-} ? &(-)                    (5)  +? = {(?, .)|?, ./*?, (?, .)/+}       (6) Hence, according to the above definition, $?  can be acquired:  $? = 0????(")  ? 0????(8)9?%(?)           (7)  As an example, Figure ? will show how to calculate the parameter $? .

Fig. 1. An example of neighbor graph of Node 1  In the above picture, degree of node 3 and node 2 in NG(v) are both 2. Hence, according to the definition, we can get that b<? and b?? are all 0.5.

Therefore, the main idea of our optimized algorithm is as follows: Input: A graph G  1) Find influential nodes in the network, and set it to D  2) Initialize the labels at all nodes in D.

For example, for a given node x, Label(x)=x. And set their status to ?Active? and the status of other nodes to inactive.

3) While True: a) For each inactive node x?D, let  Label(x)=S[Label(?? ),Label(?? ), ??.Label( ?? )],  ??, ?? ? ? ??

are active neighbors of node x.

And S here calculates the total influence of  a community containing ??, ??????  and return the community which has the greatest influence  b) Set the status of node x in a) to be active.

c) If every node is included  by its most influential adjacent community, then stop the algorithm, else go to 3.



III. ANALYSIS OF THE OPTIMIZED ALGORITHM  To evaluate the performance of optimized algorithm, we will apply it to different networks from several aspects and then make a comparison between communities acquired by LPA and optimized algorithm.

Fig. 2. A computer-generated network  Our first applications are based on Zachary?s karate club network[9] and  American college football network[10] ,both real-world networks. And also we will  examine the performance by using a computer generated network. Zachary?s karate club  network with 34 nodes and 78 edges is divided into two fractions due to leadership issues.

And for the American College football network, vertices in the graph represent teams  and edges stand for regular-season games between the two teams they connect. This  network with 115 nodes and 616 edges is split into 12 teams. We have generated a large  number of graphs with n=136 vertices, artificially divided into two communities. In  Figure ?, we can find that each community has a center point.

TABLE ?. Q VALUES FOR THE IMPROVED AND STANDARD  ALGORITHM IN DIFFERENT NETWORKS  Values in table above are calculated by  running the original and optimized algorithm both 20 times on the three networks. As we can see, in the first two networks, when compared with Q values acquired by using standard Label Propagation Algorithm, the average Q values obtained through the optimized LPA  increase by approximately 1.66% and 2.66% respectively.

Then if we analyze the result from the number of groups, when we apply the standard LPA to Zachary?s karate club network , the networks are always divided into 3 groups.

However, only two groups can we get when the optimized algorithm is operated on the network just as what it is in the real world.

On the other hand, in College Football network, these teams are divided into 12 conferences and each team plays more games within its own conference than inter conference in the real world. But the standard LPA always split this network into 10 groups. And the result for the improved one is 11 teams, which are more closed to the actual condition.

However, in the computer-generated network, the optimized algorithm perform poorly.

The main reason for this phenomenon is that our improved algorithm is based on the summation of nodes? influences. As we can see, in Figure ?, the center point in the larger community is surrounded by most of nodes in the network. And this also leads to the larger influence of this center node. Hence, when the process of community discovery begins, due to the greater influence of the larger community, the center point in the smaller community will be attracted to the larger community. Therefore, the standard algorithm can divide the network into two groups correctly and the optimized algorithm cannot get our desirable results.

Though the performance of the optimized algorithm on the computer-generated is not so good, this results still illustrate that the optimized algorithm can present a stronger community when compared with the standard one.

Another example, we use statistics collected     from RenRen, a social network site like Facebook in China. And these dates are based on a users? real friendship network with 11062 edges and 420 nodes which stands for a person in the real word. It has been shown that communities in this network are made up by their similar interests. Or if they were schoolmates at one time, they are more likely to be included by a same community.

To further evaluate the two algorithms, we still study it from the number of groups, group sizes and Q values.

TABLE ?. THE NUMBER OF GROUPS AND AVERAGE GROUP  SIZE OBTAINED  Fig. 3. The relationships between the number of groups and  group size  From the figure above, we can find that label propagation algorithm divides the network into more than 26 groups. And 21 isolated nodes which do not belong to any groups exist in the final division. However, the result acquired through the optimized algorithm are split into 7 groups and no isolated points can be found. On the other hand, the Q values we get through the two algorithms are as follows:  TABLE ?. Q VALUE FOR THE RENREN NETWORK

IV. CONCLUSION  In this paper, we examined the performance of Label Propagation Algorithm on different real world networks. And also we introduce a method to modify this standard algorithm to optimize the Q value. In the comparison we make between the two algorithms, we find that the improved algorithm provide an useful way to improve the modularity Q. And also, the groups divided by the optimized algorithm are also stronger than the original ones.

However, the modified algorithm still have some poor performances just as what we present in Section ?.  When we applied the optimized algorithm to the computer-generated network, a network divided into two groups each with a center point, the network cannot be split correctly.

Therefore, it is worthy to be analyzed further.
