Abstract: Estimating geographic information Image is a computerized representation of a picture or from an image is an excellent, difficult high-level graphic. An Image Map is therefore defined to be an computer vision problem whose time has come. image of a geographic space taken from a satellite [2].

The emergence of vast amounts of geographically So there is a need to develop a system for capturing, calibrated image data is a great reason for storing, checking, integrating, manipulating, analysing computer vision to start looking globally on the and displaying data which are spatially referenced to scale of the entire planet. In this paper, we propose the Earth.

a correlated association rule based framework for querying an image database The analysis is based 12. Aerial Image Map on geographic locations from a single image using a An aerial image is a projected image which is purely data driven feature extraction approach.

It We apply a specific set of traditional data mining can only be seen from one position in space, often techniques such as association to the non focused by another lens [4].

An image is defined to be a two-dimensional  function, f(x, y, z), where x and y are spatial (plane) 1.3 Image Mining Techniques coordinates, and (z) is the intensity or gray level of the Simply stated, image mining refers to extracting image at that point. When x, y & the amplitude values ..

Achieving similar success with image datasets remains computing resources [1]. It explains propose a novel a challenge, however, not only due to the size and clustering based dictionary design which adapts the complexity of image data, but also the lack of image dictionary to a given data set [5]. This method yields equivalents for the association rule components, better approximations of the original map data, leading namely the items, the item sets, and even the rules. to low error [1]. They are probability based & distance The objectives for applying association rule based clustering methods. Clustering is a well algorithms to traditional transaction databases are established technique for data interpretation. Existing clear. A primary objective of market basket analysis is clustering algorithms like k-means PAM (Kaufman, to determine optimal product placement on store 1990) are designed to find clusters that fit some static shelves [6]. However, the objectives for mining models. Web services are based on XML (Extensible association rules in image datasets are less obvious at Markup Language) which is a description language this early stage in research when the limit of what is widely used [2]. Many XML related technologies are technically feasible is not known [2]. Ideally, the rules used to describe, communicate with & finally use web would provide insight into the prominent trends in the service. Finally one of the biggest advantages of web dataset which are interesting but non-obvious spatial services is their ability to be chained [5]. By creating a or temporal causalities [5]. web services chain one can expand the possibilities of  the developed application. Vector data sets (e.g.

They are in a variety of applications [3]. It explores the problem Classification, Clustering and Association Rule. of existing clustering based compression method. It Classification approach analyzes the training data and proposes an adaptive approximation method that is construct model for each class based on the features in capable of handling data updates as well as reducing the image data. Clustering identifies the collections of error levels [3]. The recent availability of GPS tagged image data objects that are similar to each other. images of urban environments coupled with advances Association rules corresponds to correlations among in multi-view geometry and efficient feature matching the image data items & they are often expressed in led to a number of groups developing place rule from showing attribute value conditions that recognition algorithms, some of which competed in commonly occurs at the same time in some set of the "Where am I?"
