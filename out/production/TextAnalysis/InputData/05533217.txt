An Apriori-based Approach for Teaching Evaluation

Abstract?Intelligent evaluation  as an important branch in the field of artificial intelligence  is a decision-making process of simulating the domain experts to solve complex problems. In this paper, we puts forward a kind of intelligent evaluation method based on improved Apriori, which can be used to mine different levels of association rules and evaluate the teaching quality automatically. Firstly, we do some improvement on traditional Apriori algorithm due to its shortcomings. Secondly, we describe the procedure of the teaching quality evaluation based on such improved algorithm. Finally, we give an example and the results show that this method is feasible and effective.

I. INTRODUCTION In recent years, artificial intelligence is one of the frontier  disciplines in the development of contemporary information science and technology, and a host of researchers have paid attention to such field. In order to evaluate teaching quality in a scientific and justice way, the vast majority of colleges and universities have gradually established a series of systems on teaching quality evaluation [1]. Some valuable information is hidden in the ocean of evaluation data, which will affect the level of individual teacher's teaching quality directly or indirectly, even the decisions [2, 3]. So how to mine such useful knowledge from the huge data and what methods should be taken so as to get a better accuracy and more effectiveness?

Data Mining is the non-trivial process of acquiring efficient, innovative, potential and ultimately comprehensible knowledge from data warehouse or other information sources [4]. The data mining in teaching evaluation is that applying the appropriate ways to extract, convert, analyze and process the data from the teaching-related database, in order to make critical decision [5]. The major mining methods of teaching quality evaluation are dynamic prediction  association analysis and clustering [6].

With the purpose of doing teaching evaluation objectively, intelligently and accurately, we introduce Apriori algorithm [7] presented by Agrawal et al. into the process of teaching quality evaluation. In this paper, we propose an intelligent evaluation model based on Apriori algorithm, which can be easily applied into do evaluation in the domain of adult higher education.



II. EASE OF USE  A. Problem Analysis We can see from the above description of the Apriori  algorithm that the algorithm exists two major shortcomings:  1) It needs to repeat scan the database to count: For a given candidate set Ck, we can calculate the number of each item set through a scan of the database. When scanning to encounter the records of the candidate set, the number of the candidate set is increased by one. The time complexity of the Apriori algorithm is O( k|Ck|*n*v). Where |Ck| is the number of the item set; n is the number of records in the database; v is the average volume of each record. We can see that the total time and the database capacity required by the calculation of the candidate set are proportional to the product of the number of all the candidate sets.

2) It needs to generate a large number of candidate sets: In general, generating the n items of the frequency set, the number of the different candidate sets is as follows:  12... n n  n ?=+++  nnCCC When the generated Ck is large, the efficiency of the  algorithm is not satisfactory. These two defects seriously affect the performance of the algorithm. In order to improve the efficiency of the Apriori algorithm, we will improve it, including:  a) Compress the size of the database and reduce the number of scanning the database.

b) Reduce the number of the candidate sets that can?t be the frequent item sets.

c) Improve the speed of the frequency statistics in the data item sets.

B. Algorithm Improvement In the analysis of the Apriori algorithm, we discover that  the Apriori algorithm needs a great deal of operations to determine whether the previous k-1 items are the same and the last one item is different in the two k item sets. And many of the repeated operation are to generate the same k+1 item sets.

If we can reduce the number of the implementation times in this operation, then we can improve the running efficiency of the Apriori algorithm.

This paper is sponsored by "Eleventh Five-Year" Education Research Plan of Guangdong Province (2009tjk002) and "Eleventh Five-Year" Adult Education Research Plan of Guangdong Province (ycx092015).

The thought of the connect-step improvement: when generating the k item set by the k-1 item sets, the Lk-1 make their own connections. If previous k-2 sets in the two items are different, we give up the concatenation of the two item sets because the resulting item sets are either repeat or non- frequent. If the l1and l2 are the item sets of the Lk-1, items are ordered by ascend according to its occurrence frequency in the database. When executing the connection Lk-1?Lk-1, if l1[k- 2] l2[k-2], then abandon the connection of the l1 and l2.

Otherwise, generating k item set must be redundant, so that can reduce the computational complexity.

The improvement ideological of the frequent items: Between the Lk and Ck, introducing the Lk', when one item has been validated that it is not a frequent item set, it will be inserted into Lk', but not be deleted. In order to distinguish an item set whether it is frequent item sets or non-frequent item sets, we introduce the flag bit into the item sets. When it is the frequent item set, we use 1, or else use 0. At the same time, the verification process and the pruning process also need to be modified: when verifying the candidate set Ck, each time, we select items from the item set Ck to verify. However, each time, we select items from Lk' in the pruning process as the pruning conditions and iteratively generate Lk +1'.

When generating Ck and re-scanning the database, and if the transaction T is the same as a set of Ck, but its support is less than min-support, then the transaction T does not work to the right behind of the Ck +1. Meanwhile, in the process to generate Ck by Ck +1, if there is a transaction in the database D and the number of the item is less than k +1, it is very clear that the transaction T don?t need to be re-scanned.

The specific method is as follows:  1) Firstly define a class Record, having three members: Item (r_item), the item length (r_length), the counter (r_count): Every time, when we read data from the database, we assign the value to the Record object. When reading the first transaction T1, we make all the items of the T1 broken down into a variety of possible combinations. If the number of the combinations is n, then create n objects, the property values of the various item (r_item) are the number of the combined item r_length.

2) When reading the second T2, the way of the decomposition items is the same as the first step. If the number of the broken combinations is m, it does not necessarily create m objects. But, first of all, we determine whether the newly generating combinations are in the created object. If it already exists, it will accordingly r_count + +, or creating a new object, and completing the initialization. Repeating the second step until you read all the T.

We make use of the above steps to complete the improvement of the Apriori algorithm in order to enhance its efficiency.



III. THE MODEL OF INTELLIGENT EVALUATION Teaching evaluation is based on the certain educational  principles and policies. We propose the targeted advice process of the further improvement and development. Teaching  evaluation system is the platform that the school leaders and managers make use of to master the teaching goals and improve the quality of the teaching. Based on the school network platform, we make the design method of the teaching evaluation system. For the characteristics of the adult higher education school database, this paper presents the education quality assessment framework based on an improved Apriori algorithm. The model consists mainly of data collection, data selection, data standardization and rules recommended, as shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 1. The teaching evaluation model based on an improved Apriori Algorithm  A. Data Acquisition The goal of the data acquisition is to achieve the integrity  of the large-scale evaluation data, and accurately to collect the data. Teaching quality analysis and evaluation system uses the computer's data conversion function to directly open source database for data collection. We integrate the various types of data from transaction-oriented real-time operation database to data warehouse based on the data mining analysis, mainly including the students' evaluation information, teacher information, evaluation criteria and class teachers' instructor information integration.

B. Data Preprocessing Data cleaning usually consists of the inconsistent data  processing, the vacancy value padding, the data conversion and so on. The inconsistent data and noise data processing in the system has been completed in the information initial module.

Here, we focus on resolving the vacancy value padding and data transformation. As the Apriori algorithm is applied to the data mining in the transaction database, it needs to convert the data of the teaching information table to the corresponding transaction table to provide data mining objects for the entire data mining module.

Through the above pre-processing operation, the system has a complete, clean, and suitable for data mining output to ensure the follow-up data mining producing useful rules.

C. Data Normalization Data normalization ensures that the pre-processing data can  be transformed into the unified standard data. It is the premise to carry out the rule mining. Pros and cons of the data in this step will directly affect the results of the association rule mining. Teaching quality assessment data is a numeric type data. So it requires the dispersion processing to the continuous standard data sets. Through the discrete processing, we get the standard data sets suitable for the algorithms to make the association rule mining. For example, the evaluation data is divided into five levels: H1 ~ [0-60], H2 ~ [61-70], H3 ~ [71- 80], H4 ~ [81-90], H5 ~ [91-100].

D. Rule generation We will apply the improved Apriori algorithm to the  method which mainly includes the following steps:  1) Generating the transaction database: We extract the property from the teachers? archive database. And we merge it with the students' assessment results to group a table. That provides data mining objects for the entire data mining module.

As the Apriori algorithm is fit for the data mining of the transaction database, it needs to convert the corresponding relationship table to the transaction database.

The field values in the record are converted to the corresponding project using the code table. We make use of the data mining technology to analysis the collected evaluation data. We try to discover useful knowledge hidden in the data and extract the useful knowledge for the schools and teachers.

2) We introduce the improved Apriori algorithm in the 2.2 part to the rule mining process: mainly including the transactional data connections, as well as the frequent item set pruning, trying to find the largest item set.

3) After generating the frequent item sets, and for any frequent k item sets, we find out all possible subset as the antecedent of association rules based on the given association rule algorithm: We calculate the confidence of the corresponding rules. When the confidence degree of a rule is greater than the minimum confidence level, it output that rule.

Once finding the frequent item sets from the transaction in the database D, we can directly generate the strong association rules (strong association rules satisfy the minimum support degrees and minimum confidence degrees).

E. Recommended Rules Recommended rules refer to recommending the excavated  usefulness association rules to the user, and can accept the user's evaluation. This includes the parsing steps of the rule. It is the display section of the result information. In order to allow users to more intuitively understand the extracted knowledge, we will usually visualize the resulting information and return the results to the user.



IV. CASE STUDY In order to prove the correctness and effectiveness of the  model proposed in this paper, this section will validate the method through a real-life example. The goal of this test is to mine and analysis the evaluated data information based on the existing quality of education in order to provide basis of decision-making for improving the teaching quality of teachers and the school's overall standard of teaching.

A. Data collection and data cleaning Based on resources needs in system analysis, we collect the  personal basic conditions data of 696 teachers in school, and the teaching quality assessment data to 696 teachers of 2478 students and other assessment data in second semester of the 2008-2009 school year. As the data has been made requirements when inputting, there is no empty data and dirty data, so no need doing special cleaning treatment.

As affected by different factors, different survey objects share different weight in teaching quality evaluation grades, so that the different survey objects have various weighting in teachers teaching quality assessment, as shown in Table 1.

TABLE I. ASSESSMENT WEIGHT  Questionnaire Student Expert Leader  Weight 0.5 0.3 0.2  Evaluation methods can be divided into qualitative assessment and quantitative evaluation. Due to the position of every evaluation index that is different in teaching quality, therefore, every index shares the different weight when comprehensively assessing the teaching quality, as shown in table 2. Table 3 shows the teachers' score calculated by the parameters from Table 1 and Table 2.

TABLE II. INDEX WEIGHT  Inspection standard teaching  attitude teaching method  teaching level  teaching effect Language  Weight 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2  TABLE III. TABLE 3 THE TEACHERS' SCORE  Teacher ID  teaching attitude  teaching method  teaching level  ?? Total score  1 8 9 7 ?? 87 2 7 8 5 ?? 83 3 8 7 7 ?? 85 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 696 9 8 6 ?? 78  B. Data Discretization In the table of teachers status and the table of teaching  quality assessment, few of data (such as age) are the same in exactly, if mining the data directly, the test will not get the desired result meeting the degree of support and confidence, so data in the table must be transformed, and combined the same    or similar attribute values into a single attribute value in order to satisfy the degree of support and confidence. Specific data transformation rules are as follows:  1) Age discretization, the transforming age of data is divided into 6 grades as follows:  A: [0-30]. B: [31-35]. C: [36-40]. D: [41-45]. E: [46-50]. F: [51- + ].

2) Teaching attitude discretization, transforming teaching attitude into four grades.

A: [0-5]. B: [6-10]. C: [11-15]. D: [16-20].

3) Teaching method discretization, transforming teaching content into four grades.

A: [0-5]. B: [6-10]. C: [11-15]. D: [16-20].

4) Teaching level, discrete data will soon be teaching methods of data transformation for the four grades of data.

A: [0-5]. B: [6-10]. C: [11-15]. D: [16-20].

5) The effect of data discretization of the teaching is about teaching efficacy data transformation for the four grades of data.

A: [0-5]. B: [6-10]. C: [11-15]. D: [16-20].

6) Language discretization of the teaching is transformation for the four grades of data.

A: [0-5]. B: [6-10]. C: [11-15]. D: [16-20].

C. Rules Mining By using the method described in section 3, scanning the  data set D to find the candidate set of data items C1 by Apriori algorithm, and obtain frequent item sets L1 by the minimum support, generate candidate data item sets C2 from the L1 by algorithm, then get the frequent data item sets L2 by the minimum degree of support, at last, can get the whole frequent data items sets. Set minimum support degree as 15%, minimum confidence level as 15%, the evaluation score>=80. Some parts of the results are given in Table 4.

TABLE IV. PARTS OF THE RULES MINING RESULTS  Rule No Age Title  Educa- tion  teaching attitude ?

D. Rules Analysis Table 4 shows that the preliminary data show that  association rules, for example: the possibility of the age of range A, and the evaluation score>=80 is 45.3%, support rate  was 21.1%. These rules show that high academic and title young teachers have rich teaching experience and a high degree of confidence, the quality of teaching has been well received. According to the preliminary association rules, the intrinsic relationship of some properties can be found, such as: the relationship among teaching effectiveness, age, job title and education.

It can be also found that the teachers with title of associate professor and master's degree education have higher research levels, wider range of knowledge and a high level of teaching quality. The teachers with better teaching attitudes and teaching methods have better level of teaching quality. It indicates that: when taking efforts to improve the operational capacity, the professional accomplishment also should be improved.



V. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we suggested a model of teaching quality  evaluation based on a refined Apriori algorithm, including its analyzing, design and implementation. We described the data acquirement and preprocessing of how to obtain a useful teaching evaluation data and created an appropriate database for mining. Using the improved Apriori-based algorithm, we established a way of mining some valuable knowledge from the database abovementioned, aiming at finding the most influence factors of the teachers' teaching and providing decision support to improve and enhance teaching quality.

Through the improved algorithm, we can get a better mining results and more effectiveness, achieve do teaching evaluation quality in combination with technologies in data mining.
