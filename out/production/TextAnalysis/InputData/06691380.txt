ICETACS 2013

Abstract  We will first provide a framework to analyze the evolution of software applications and  the derived opportunities for market disruption that emerge. We will then apply the  framework, first to well know success stories and then to the future. Our window into the  future will be based on recent research mostly from the MIT Field Intelligence  Laboratory. We will focus on Big Data and various engineering solutions that are  currently being researched including sensors that enable new applications (light scanning,  smart skins, water leakage, temperature RFID); architectural solutions that enable new  data sharing models for applications (such as cloud car, RFID middleware, digital  graffiti); and the potential disruptive business impact in various business processes and  industries including the supply chain, massive on-line open courses, smart cities, auto-  industry and social media.
