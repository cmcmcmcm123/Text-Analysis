Fractal Study on Fault System of Carboniferous in  Junggar Basin Based on GIS

Abstract?Fault system is a significant evidence of tectonic movement during crust tectonic evolution and may play an more important role in oil-gas accumulation process than other tectonic types in sedimentary basin. Carboniferous surface faults in Junggar Basin developed well and varied in size and distribution. There are about 200 faults in Carboniferous, and 187 of them are thrust faults. Chaos-fractals theories have been widely investigated and great progress has been made in the past three decades. One of the important conception-fractal dimension had become a powerful tool for describing non-linearity dynamical system characteristic. The clustered objects in nature are often fractal and fault system distribution in space is inhomogeneous, always occurs in groups, so we can describe spatial distribution of faults from the point of fractal dimension.

Fractal dimension of fault system is a comprehensive factor associated with fault number, size, combination modes and dynamics mechanism, so it can evaluate the complexity of fault system quantitatively. The relationship between fault system and oil-gas accumulation is a focus and difficulty problem in petroleum geology, and fractal dimension is a new tool for describing fault distribution and predicting potential areas of hydrocarbon resources. Geographic Information System (GIS) is a kind of technological system collecting, storing, managing, computing, analyzing, displaying and describing the geospatial information supported by computer software and hardware. In the last 15-20 years, GIS have been increasingly used to address a wide variety of geoscience problems. Weights-of-evidence models use the theory of conditional probability to quantify spatial association between fractal dimension and oil-gas accumulation.

The weights of evidence are combined with the prior probability of occurrence of oil-gas accumulation using Bayes?rule in a log- linear form under an assumption of conditional independence of the dimension maps to derive posterior probability of occurrence of oil-gas accumulation. In this paper, we first vectorize the fault system in Carboniferous of Junggar Basin in GIS software and store it as polyline layer in Geodatabase of GIS to manage and analyze, then calculate the fractal dimension of three types which are box dimension, information dimension and cumulative length dimension using spatial functions of GIS, in the last use weights- of-evidence model to calculate the correlation coefficients in GIS environment between oil-gas accumulation and three types of fractal dimension in order to quantity the importance of fault system.

I. INTRODUCTION As tectonic features remained by tectonic movements,  fault system was a prominent sign of contrary movements in tectonic evolution processes. In sedimentary basins, fault system played a more important role compared with other tectonic styles and because of its universality, periodicity, inheritance, difference and gradation, there was a certain link between fault system and genesis, distribution of the oil and gas [1]. The fault system of Carboniferous in Junggar Basin developed well and varied in distribution and size. There are more than 200 Carboniferous faults in Junggar Basin whose types are thrust fault, back fault and flushes fault. The characteristics of the fault development period are very obvious, and the different tectonic movements effected differently on the fault development and on the fault distribution [2]. The relationship between faults and oil-gas resource accumulation process was a hot and difficult problem in recent years, but there were few methods and techniques of studying faults inside the basin especially in semi-quantitative and quantitative ways.

Geographic Information System (GIS) is a kind of technological system collecting, storing, managing, computing, analyzing, displaying and describing the geospatial information supported by computer software and hardware [3]. In the last 15-20 years, GIS have been increasingly used to address a wide variety of geoscience problems. As one of the greatest natural science discoveries of the 20th century, chaos-fractals theories have been widely investigated and great progress has been made in the past three decades. Geology is one of the most active fields using fractal geometry to study relevant problems, such as the processing technique for high-resolution 3-D seismic data [4], description of reservoir heterogeneity [5], DSS for oil exploration and development [6] and so on.

Evidence weight method was first presented by Bonham-Carter and Agterberg which used statistical analysis pattern and took the Bayes conditional probabilities as base [7]. It regarded every geology factor influenced oil and gas evolution as evidence and computed the weight of every evidence which defined its contribution to oil and gas prediction.

This paper tried to study the fault system of Carboniferous in Junggar Basin used fractal theory and weights-of-evidence model based on GIS. First it vectorized the fault system of Carboniferous in Junggar Basin and stored    it as polyline layer in Geodatabase of GIS to manage and analyze, then calculated the fractal dimension of three types which are box dimension, information dimension and cumulative length dimension using spatial functions of GIS, in the last used weights-of-evidence model to compute the correlation coefficients in GIS environment between oil-gas accumulation and three types of fractal dimension in order to quantity the importance of fault system.



II. FRACTAL DIMENSION OF FAULT SYSTEM  A. Overview of Fractal Theory As one of the greatest natural science discoveries of the  20th century, fractal theories have been widely investigated and great progress has been made in the past three decades. One of the important conception which is fractal dimension had become a powerful tool for describing non-linearity dynamical system characteristic. As Feder points out, clustered objects in nature are often fractal. Clustering, or the aggregation of matter in space, defines the concentration or density of matter.

Because clustering is the dominant characteristic of the spatial arrangement of fault system, we can describe spatial distribution of faults from a fractal point. The value of fractal dimension to fault system is a comprehensive index which describes the number, size, combination and dynamical mechanism of fault system, so it can be considered as a quantitative factor to complexity of fault system [8]. Generally, fault system had higher values of fractal dimension where fracture length was longer, rock fragmentation is bigger, more small and branch faults, high structure amplitude, intense structure deformation, otherwise, the fault system had lower value of fractal dimension.

B. Three Types and Formulas of Fractal Dimension in Fault System  1) Box dimension: It is used widely because of its simple computational method [9]. First, the total study area is divided into even and continuous square grid with sides of r, then we record the number of squares containing fault lines partly or totally which is denoted as N(r). Second, repeat the step above with the square sides reduced to r/2, r/4, r/8? until approached zero and we can define the box dimension as D1:  D1=- )lg(/)(lglim  rrN r?  .                              (1)  Because in practice we can only take finite sides of square, people usually draw fractal plot diagrams which the ordinate represents the number(N) and the abscissa represents the size of length(r) of square side and then get the box dimension from slope of lgN?lgr line.

2) Information dimension: The chief weakness of counting number of not empty squares to calculate the fractal dimension is that the dimension does not reflect the nonuniformity of geometry objects because the square containing one fault is important as the square containing more than one fault. We number every square with i=1,2?n, and if the ith box has Ni(r) faults falling into, the probability(Pi) of faults falling into ith box is given by: Pi=Ni(r)/N(r), where N(r) is total number of faults falling into all boxes. Last according to the information  formula: I(r)=-? =  n  i ii rPrP  )(lg)( , where n is the total number of  boxes, and we can define the information dimension D2 as follows:  D2=- )lg(/)(lim  rrI r?    (2) 3) Cumulative length dimension. Compared with direction,  density and distribution of fault system, the analysis of length can obtain more information. On the basis of previous work, there is a fractal relation between cumulative number of fault line and fault length as follows [10]:  M(r)=Cr-D3                                              (3) Where M(r) is the number of faults whose length is  longer than r, D3 is the cumulative length dimension, C is a constant.

C. Calculating Fractal Dimensions Based on GIS The advantages of GIS include its database manner of  data management, its capability to overlay and integrate different spatial information, and its powerful tools and functions for image analysis, spatial analysis and modeling. So it is suitable for GIS to extract and manage the fault system and compute the fractal dimensions.

The overlay toolset in ArcGIS contains tools to combine, erase, modify or update multiple feature classes to spatial features in a new feature class. New information is created when overlaying one set of features with another. There are six types of overlay operations; all involve joining two existing sets of features into a single set of features to identify spatial relationships between the input features. The intersect tool calculates the geometric intersection of any number of feature class and feature layers. The features or portion of features which are common to (intersect) all inputs will be written to the output feature class.

The length of every fault line is stored as a basic field in layer of GIS geographical database automatically after vectorization, so we can compute the cumulative length dimension of fault system by using (3) easily and the result is showed in Fig2(c). Calculating box dimension and information dimension of fault system took four steps. First, the total study area should be divided into squares with sides(r) of 80km, then all square area layers overlaid with fault line layer by using intersect function of GIS and we can obtain a new layer as a result. Secondly, opening the attribute table of new layer, we record the number of squares which contain fault lines partly or totally and calculate the length of those lines. Third, repeat the steps above with the square sides changed to 40km(r/2), 20km(r/4), 10km(r/8) and 5km(r/16). Last drawing fractal plot diagrams which the ordinate represents the number(N) and information(I) of squares and the abscissa represents the size of length(r) of square side and then we can see there are obvious linear relationship in double logarithmic plots from Fig2a, Fig2b, so we get three fractal dimensions: D1=1.43, D2=1.48, D3=1.79.

Three fractal plot diagrams of fault system .

The value of fractal dimension to fault system is a comprehensive index which describes the number, size, combination and dynamical mechanism of faults, so we can obtain different fractal dimension value in different place of study region. Because three fractal dimension values what we calculated above are just suitable for total research area, in order to better study the relationship between fractal dimension and oil-gas resources distribution in every place, we compute  three fractal dimension values of every 80km side squares to interpolate three thematic maps of study area showed in Fig3.

From Fig2 and Fig3 we can see that fractal dimension obtained by different methods are different in the same place and there is a good correlation between higher fractal dimension value and complexity of fault system. The areas which have higher three fractal dimension values lie in the middle and east region and those places also have maximum fault density and length.

III. USING WEIGHTS-OF-EVIDENCE MODEL TO COMPUTE CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS AND RANK THE IMPORTANCE OF FAULT ATTRIBUTES  The weights-of-evidence model?s principle and its explanation to evidence of geology factors are simple and it is easy to realize. Moreover, it can deal with areas which lose information. The difference between positive and negative  weight of geology evidence show the importance of indicating oil-gas accumulation.

In oil and gas resource assessment, the spatial relationship between geology evidence and oil-gas resources distribution can be calculated from ratio of related regional area:  P(d)=S(d)/A?P(ej?d)=[S(d)?S(ej)]/S(d)] (4)  (b) Information dimension diagram  y = -1.4765x + 4.2159  R2 = 0.9981  -4  -3  -2  -1   3 3.5 4 4.5 5  lg(r)  I( r)    Where d stands for appearances of oil-gas resources while e1,e2,?,en stands for appearances of geology evidence, both d and ej are layers stored in GIS. A is area of total study region, S(d) is total area of oil-gas resources while S(ej) is total area of ej. ? d stands for disappearance of oil-gas resources while ? ej stands for disappearance of j evidence. If overlaying oil- gas resources layers with j geology evidence layers, there are  four results which are ej ? d, ? ej ? d, ej ? ? d and ? ej? ? d, so we can define four corresponding conditional probabilities as follows:  P(d?ej)= S(ej? d)/S(ej) P( ? d?ej)= S(ej? ? d)/S(ej)  P(d?? ej)= S( ? ej? d)/S( ? ej) P( ? d?? ej)= S( ? ej? ? d)/S( ? ej)  The positive and negative weight of j geology evidence can be defined as W j+  and W j  ? :  W j+ =ln P(ej?d)/ P(ej?? d)?  W j? = ln P( ? ej?d)/ P( ? ej?? d) The correlation coefficients between j geology evidence  and oil-gas resources distribution is C j , and can be given by:  C j =W j + -W j?  In the terms of oil and gas resources assessment, the higher the value of Cj is, the closer the link is between the geology evidence and oil-gas resources appearance and the bigger contribution is to oil-gas exploration. So Cj can be used as an indicator showing importance of geology evidence.

To some extent the attributes of fault system affect and limit the spatial distribution of oil and gas resource, so they can be considered as the geology evidences. Every attribute of fault system plays a different role in hydrocarbon accumulation and we can use weights-of-evidence model to compute correlation coefficients and rank the importance of every fault attribute.

According to the weights-of-evidence model, we used overlay analysis between fault attribute layer and oil-gas resource layer based on GIS to get correlation coefficient of every fault attribute in Tab1. Take correlation coefficients of cumulative length dimension for an example, we use intersect function in GIS to obtain the intersection of oil-gas resource layer and cumulative length dimension layer of fault system showed in Fig4 and compute the correlation coefficient as follows:  W + =ln P(e?d)/ P(e?? d)=ln( 300283/130180 4918/2922 )=0.3  W ? = ln P( ? e?d)/ P( ? e?? d)=ln( 300283/170103 4918/1996 )  =-0.3  C =W + -W ? =0.6    Figure 3.  Using intersect function in GIS to calculate the correlation coefficient of cumulative length dimension.

From the result in Tab1 we can draw a conclusion that distribution of faults covers a small area but it is most important and most effective because the value of correlation coefficient is highest(c=2.6). Density, information dimension, length and box dimension of fault system are in close relation with oil-gas accumulation while cumulative length dimension and connectivity of fault system have some relation with oil- gas accumulation.

IV. CONCLUSIONS There is a good correlation between higher fractal  dimension value and complexity of fault system. Generally, fault system had higher values of fractal dimension where fracture length was bigger, more small and branch faults, high structure amplitude, intense structure deformation. Otherwise, the fault system had lower value of fractal dimension.

Fractal dimension obtained by different methods are different and have different meanings in the same place. In this paper we calculated the fractal dimension of three types which are box dimension, information dimension and cumulative length dimension using spatial functions of GIS,  in the last use weights-of-evidence model to calculate the correlation coefficients between oil-gas accumulation and three types of fractal dimension in order to quantity the importance of fault system.

According to the correlation coefficients calculated by weights-of-evidence model we can know that distribution of faults covers a small area but it is most important and most effective because the value of correlation coefficient is highest(c=2.6). Density, information dimension, length and box dimension of fault system are in close relation with oil-gas accumulation while cumulative length dimension and connectivity of fault system have some relation with oil-gas accumulation.

The advantages of GIS include its database manner of data management, its capability to overlay and integrate different spatial information, and its powerful tools and functions for image analysis, spatial analysis and modeling. Thus, it well  suited for extracting, manipulating, and analyzing fault system information. In GIS software we can analyze and deal with fault system quickly and effectively using overlay functions of GIS spatial analysis.
