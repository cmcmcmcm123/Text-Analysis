Abstract ? Nowadays, there are a lot of news about hacking attacks over the Internet against companies and government organization Web sites in the world. Victims are big companies such as Evernote, Facebook, Google and others. Web server providers understand that the current authentication systems and passwords should be strong. The end users who are not specialists in the security should understand how to select strong passwords. Now, however, there is no ideal way to set a strong password. Most of the users don?t know important elements for password protection. In this paper, we analyze the tendencies in the password protection. We survey 262 students of the University of Aizu. A questionnaire consists of 15 questions about length of a password, strategy to create a new password and etc. We discuss useful techniques to create strong passwords and compare them. Our analysis is based on our data and the state of the art literature review. Our results can be helpful for the users to create a new password and/or change it and make it strong.

I. INTRODUCTION  Password authentication is one of important services on the Internet, personal computers and so on. We always use password authentication to be logged into Web applica- tions, remote systems and etc. Now password authenti- cation is an essential service in our life for protecting our data. On the other hand, this service is also very dangerous cause of hacking attacks. If the user set a password that is easy to hack or guess, the user may loose money, sensitive data, etc. Thus, many companies and/or governmental organizations consider this service as 2-step password authentication for protecting the data. For example, Google has developed 2-step verification system in 2011 [1] and all user accounts of Google can use 2- step password verification for protecting their data from hackers. This service should be very strong, however it?s not a complete system yet.

Passwords are, of course, not the only the means to authenticate end users to systems. Book [2] discusses three key options for authentication. The first one, it is to retain physical control on the device such as a remote car door key. The second one is a password. The third option is to use something like a fingerprint or iris pattern. Also recently Hardware Authentication is one of them. But for the cost reason, most systems take passwords. Thus, we have to know more details about passwords. To obtain a  good knowledge of password authentication, there are a lot of sources. To understand password security better, we consider the problem from three different angles:  ? Will the user remember the password?

? Will the user choose a password that?s hard to hack  or guess?

? Will the user reuse the password on other systems  and/or applications?

In this paper, we seek to better understanding of the  tendencies that make creating and/or changing passwords.

We discuss key security problems, tendencies in password protection techniques, misunderstanding points for the users, etc. We present the results of a survey of 262 University of Aizu undergraduate students. The results of our investigations are important for end users to help in setting the strong passwords.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we discuss basic issues to encrypt a password, hacking approaches, protecting measures, and some tools to hack passwords. In section III, we discuss the tendencies in password protection, show the results of our question- naire, and compare them with other data. In Section IV, we show some japanese data collected by the Information- technology Promotion Agency, Japan [3] and compare them with our data. In Section V, we discuss practical recommendations to set strong passwords. In Section VI, we highlight our significant findings.



II. PASSWORD HACKING The standard way to present the passwords on the  remote server or on the local computer is to encrypt them.

Because keeping a plaintext file with passwords is very dangerous, passwords are often protected by encrypting them using one-way algorithms. Encryption algorithms use hash functions.

In this section, we analyze ways to construct hash functions and discuss the approaches to hack or guess passwords.

A. One-Way Encryption When we try to access a Web application, on-line  system etc, the password is passed through a one-way function and the user is logged into only if it matches a value of the stored one already. However, actually we use a more precisely techniques. Thus, the right way to do it is to     1) generate random numbers by a pseudo-random gen- erator, that is called salt  2) pass through a one-way function with the password and the salt  3) If it matches a value, store the salt and the hash value in the file.

When the user logged in next time, the stored values are used for checking a password.

One-way functions are one of classical type of ciphers and also known as Cryptographic hash functions. They are used to compute checksums on files: you can compute hash values of the files to identify which files are already known and which are new ones. Also hash values are used as means of checking the integrity of files as they are changed if files are corrupted. An example of this usage is the digital signature. Signature algorithms tend to be slow if the message is very long, so it?s usually convenient to sign a message digest rather than the message itself.

There are three properties related to on one-way functions.

The first property is one-way. Given an input x, we can easily compute the hash value h(x), however, it is very difficult to find the input x, if the hash value h(x) is known. (See Figure 1) On the other hand, a pseudo- random function will also have this property or will be used to distinguish from a random function.

The second property is that output will not give any information about any part of the input. Thus, a one- way encryption of the value x can be accomplished by concatenating it with a secret key k and computing h(x,k).

If the the number of possible salt values is not enough to utilize it, then the one-way encryption will produce a lot of collisions in calculation of the hash values.

The third property is that it?s difficult to find collisions when the two different messages M1 ?= M2 will result with h(M1) = h(M2). If the hash function output is an n-bit number, the number of hashes the enemy will need to compute before he can expect to find. A match will be about 2n/2 hashes. This issue is very important in security engineering.

For the one-way function, it is crucial to have these properties. If it defects just only one thing, the function can be hacked easily by hackers and the user will loose a lot of data. For example, MD5 is one of the popular hash functions, however it was broken in 2004 [4], [5]; collisions can now be found easily, even between strings containing meaningful information.

B. Hacking Approaches For a hacker, the first step to hack a password is to  encrypt the possible password candidates and to compare the result values with the values of encrypted real pass- word. Actually, there may be some weak points in some functions or hackers can find the weak points faster than specialists in security can do that; and hackers may attack these weak points utilizing a lot of ways. The one of the common way to break the passwords is to scan the whole  Figure 1. Parts of one-way function?s properties  space of the character set used in passwords for a brute force attack. The one way functions or algorithms like MD5, SHA etc are very fast to run. For hackers, however, this is very important because they can use a brute force attack easily. Base on this, a time-effective approach is to think about the candidates that are to be the actual words, patterns, or combination of the characters, which are not difficult to remember [6].

Another common way used in practice is dictionary attacks. In the past, some system that use an encrypted password file made readable. A user who can fetch this file then try to break passwords offline using a dictio- nary. Thus, he encrypts the values in his dictionary and compares them with those in the file. This activity is called dictionary attacks. Actually most modern operating system have fixed this problem. However, the dictionary attacks are still implemented. Study [7] discuss fast dic- tionary attack algorithms by using time-space tradeoff and actually their algorithm recovered 67.6% of the passwords using a 2? 109 search space.

C. Hacking Tools  There are several hacking tools available to hack or guess passwords. The target of hacking tools is two object: passwords and the function for administrators to reactively check the passwords used in the system. The reactive checking may increase the system security by finding the easy to hack passwords and by warning the related uses to change their passwords to prevent their accounts from being cracked by intruders [6]. John the Ripper and Hashcat [8], [9] are the tools to do the analysis and provide information on methods used by hackers.



III. TENDENCIES IN THE PASSWORD PROTECTION  We do hope a lot of end users can set strong passwords in the future. However, now the Internet community is facing many problems. One of them is in many misun- derstandings in the security problems. In this section, we focus on this problem. We discuss which information is true or not.

A survey on password protection issues was conducted in April 2013 at the University of Aizu. The participa- tions are 163 second year undergraduate students and 99 third year undergraduate students majoring in Computer Science. A questionnaire in paper-based format was dis- tributed among 262 students. It consists of 15 questions. A goal of this survey was to get the information on password usage by unprofessional security users. We summarize the results of discussions by using survey data and data from others sources [6], [10]?[13].

A. Difficulties with a password structure Our results shows that 8% (22) of students said that  their password is strong and 80% (211) of students said that it is not strong. It means that they don?t have a good strategy to set strong passwords. Another interesting outcome is: 40% (105) of students use the same password for different accounts such as Google account, Facebook account, etc. The mean of accounts that is used for the same password is 5.4 accounts. Study [13] shows that about 30% of users used the same password four or more times. Thus, we need a strategy to set a strong password for each end user. So, we tried to understand a strategy to set new password from the data of our survey but we could not find it. We prepared following selections for this question.

? Password based on the first letter of each word in a phrase.

? Based on the name of someone or something.

? Based on a word or name with numbers / symbols  added to beginning or end.

? Based on a word or name with numbers and symbols  substituting for some of the letters.

? Based on a word in a language other than English ? Based on a phone number ? Based on an address ? Based on a birthday ? Abbreviation consisting of the first characters of the  phrase/sentence ? Others  However, 36% (96) students selected ?Others? and 16% students selected ?I prefer not to answer?. The length of the passwords is very important issue in the password protection. From our observation we found that many users have one big misunderstanding related to passwords.

It is about long passwords.

Actually, many users believe that long passwords are equal to strong passwords but this is not true. Why the long password is not equal to the strong password? All users must memorize the long passwords. However it is very difficult for them to memorize the string like this ?qVwN2s6K@Ka?. Thus, they create the long password that is very easy to memorize and then many users use grammatical structure such as ?Ihave3cats? for the passwords [11]. This password may be long but applying the dictionary attack, it can be easily guessed. As a  Password Length  Fr eq  ue nc  y  0 5 10 15 20 25      Figure 2. Tendency of password length  result, the possibility to hack or guess increases from 6% to 20.5% [11]. We carefully analyzed resulting sheets.

Figure 2 shows the distribution of the password length.

The mean of password length is 9.1 characters. Figure 3 and Table I shows the difference of distribution between third year and second year students. For 2nd year students, the standard deviation is 2.4 but for third year students, the standard deviation is 3.0. It means third year students have more variations in password length compared to second year students.

Table I. DIFFERENCE OF STANDARD DEVIATION BETWEEN 2ND YEAR AND 3RD YEAR STUDENTS  Question Summary ?(2ndyear) ?(3rdyear) Password Length 2.409025 3.071228 How many lowercase letters? 2.832335 3.421342 How many uppercase letters? 1.646054 2.66999 How many numerical letters? 1.667903 3.61654  Study [6] shows the relationship between the password length and strength of passwords. The portion of the strong passwords with the length of 7 characters has a proportion of 96 % among the whole passwords. Such a high percentage is not observed for the passwords with the length less than 7. According to these results, number 7 is the critical threshold value of the password length and the passwords including less than 7 characters may be seen as weak. Another data related to the character lengths of the passwords is that the password with the exact length of 8 characters have a rate of 45 % among the all passwords. This last observation implies that the users have a high tendency on choosing passwords with 8-character long.

Study [11] suggests to use Part-of-Speech tagging that is such as Determiner Adjective Adjective Noun to hack and utilize common hacking tools characterized in Section II.

Difficulties with Memorizing Passwords  In fact, the password problem will be summed up as Please choose a password that is difficult to remember and Don?t write down it on paper. Book [2] discusses problems related to memorizing passwords under four main headings.

1) Naive Password Choice: One possible explanation is that many people try to use the same password every- where.

2) User Abilities and Training: The best compromise will often be a password checking program that rejects clearly bad user choices, plus a training program to get your compliant users to choose mnemonic passwords.

Password checking can be done using a program like crack to filter user choices [14].

3) Design Errors: Attempts to make passwords mem- orable are a frequent source of severe design errors. Es- pecially with the many systems built rapidly by unskilled people in the dot com rush by businesses to get online.

So, the smart user will avoid their business; famous one, whose mothers? maiden names are in Who?s Who, should be certainly avoided [2].

4) Operational Failures: The user is not only wrong with password selections. Nowadays, there are many web applications running on databases that use well-known default master passwords and websites listing the defaults for everything in sight. These passwords will be hacked soon because the default password is using well known patterns and hacker knows this fact.

C. Tendencies to Create Passwords  We show details about the nature of characters in the passwords. The mean of lower-case characters in the password is 5.1 characters and the upper-case characters is 1.3 characters and the numerical characters is 2.8  Terms  Fr eq  ue nc  y  0 50 100 150 200       Figure 4. Period of time to change the password  characters. We compared this data with data discussed in [10], [12]?s and the results are very similar to each others. Thus, this data is not only unique data for our university. About 50% of characters in the passwords are in lower-case.

Study [6] reveals another tendency in creation of pass- words that the users also prefer to include uppercase characters in the passwords. One important issue from this data is that passwords containing at least one punctuation character such as ?, ?, !, &, <, > etc are not used often but the probability to hack them is very low. The outcome from this is: we may use more often punctuation characters to set our passwords. From our survey, we observe that 6% of students use these characters in the passwords.

Figure 4 shows the distribution of data obtained over periods of time to change the password. The value of 0 means that the participant of the survey does not change the password at all. Numbers mean the period in days to change the password. This result is very surprising for us because about 43% (115) of students have never changed the password at the resources like Gmail, Facebook, etc since they set the password for first time. Actually, at our university, every student must change the university account password within 90 days since the password has been set. Only 17% (28) of second year students have changed the password within 90 days on external services. However we will not force them to change their password because according to [15] that may be happened to change passwords to improve security but much to increase everyone?s frustration. We should note, hackers may be waiting for the change of the password to hack it.

Thus, changing the password should be considered very careful.

The privacy issue is very sensitive for Japanese mentality. Our questionnaire has the selection ?I prefer NOT to answer? for partici- pants who don?t want to answer to the question.

We found important outcome from our observation: the questions that related to privacy (questions from the first half of the table) became high percentage and not related to privacy (the second half of the table) became low percentage.

D. 2-Step Authentication 2-step authentication is a system to be logged into a  Web Application etc. There are two steps for users to verify whether the user is correct or not.

Step1: You must input a password and your user name.

Step2: If Step1 is successful, the company will send you the e-mail and you will get a sequence of alphabetical, numerical characters or both. The e-mail address is that your cellphone?s company distributed you the e-mail address such as @company name.com, not such as Gmail, etc. And then, you must input the sequence in several minutes because the sequence has a limit to input as an available sequence. If it?s successful, you will log in but if it?s not successful, you must go back to Step1.

This is 2-step authentication have already used by many big companies such as Google [1]. We strongly recommend you to use it for protection your data.



IV. ISSUES RELATED TO JAPAN  The hacking attacks are increasing in the world. How- ever for the developing security area in 2012, the quantity of ?Unknown? virus that is never seen decreased about half of it compared to 2010 in Japan. (See Figure 5) It means that we reveal some viruses called ?Unknown? and find a way to defense against them. However, the  Figure 5. Damage caused by hacking access  ID/Password viruses are almost the same. So, we must know more details about passwords and keep them in mind for protecting our sensitive data. If users have these knowledge in these practical security issues, the password security level that company?s security and personal secu- rity will be higher [3].

The kind of hacking attacks are ?Other?, ?Unknown?, ?Defect of Setting?, Version/Batch? and ?ID/Password?.

Shortly, term 1 means the period between Jan.2010 and Jun.2010, term 2 means Jul.2010 and Dec.2010, term 3 means Jan.2011 and Jun.2011, ?term 4? Jul.2011 and Dec.2011, term 5 means Jan.2012 and Jun.2012.



V. PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS The final question in the questionnaire is on the par-  ticipant understanding of strong passwords. The students were asked to select the strongest password among the following:  a) the password that consists of some English phrases or words and is as long as possible. (ex: thisis- strongpassword)  b) the password that includes numerical, upper-case, lower-case and special characters and is short. (less than 8 characters)  c) the password that is created as an abbreviation from a phrase of sentence. (ex. I want be great Software Engineer ? IwbgSE)  26 students selected variant a, 182 students selected variant b and 35 students selected variant c. In Section III, we revealed the long password is not always strong password and variant a is one such example it can be easily guessed using grammar tools. Variant c is well     known way for setting passwords and this is easy for the end user to memorize. However, hackers also know this way for setting it and actually they work on how to break.

So, variant c is not weak but not very strong. Variant b is actually strong password. However, for memorizing the passwords, variant b is NOT good for end users.

From this survey, we analyzed the end users can distinguish which password is strong. On the other hand, they don?t have good strategies to set a strong password by themselves. Actually, in second year students, 9% students selected variant a, 71% students selected variant b, and 10% students selected variant c. And in third year students, 11% students selected variant a, 65% students selected variant b, 18% students selected variant c. Thus, an understanding the strong password is the same level between second and third year students.

Now it is time to summarize the users misunderstand- ings. Studies [11], [16]?[18] and results of our investiga- tions are good sources for such explanation.

? The long password is NOT always equal to the strong password. when you set the passwords, you should set passwords such as long, without language grammatical structure, easy to memorize etc [11].

? A password consisting only of numerical characters or only alphabetical characters such as only upper- case or only lower-case is very dangerous. It will be easily hacked or guessed. The users should use numerical and alphabetical characters to set pass- words [17], [19].

? We strongly recommend the users for memorizing passwords to use a password management tools such as Last Path, 1Password, KeePass, Password Dragon, etc [18].

? Users should avoid to use such as ?password?, ?abc123? and personal data such as name, birthday, address, telephone number, etc directly. It?s well known news that a lot of users set such passwords and hackers have already known it.

? A password that usable as abbreviation from a phrase of sentence is good for end users to memorize the password.

? The user should NOT tell any person their passwords and should NOT share it with any person.



VI. CONCLUSION  In this paper, we focused on the practical issues re- lated to setting a strong password in the real world. We discussed security issues related to password protection tendencies, misunderstandings in the password protection, difficulties to memorize the passwords, strategies and algorithms. Our analysis is from survey of 262 University of Aizu students and obtained results are compared with data from different sources. We analyzed key problems for setting a strong password for Web applications, remote systems, etc. Now, however, many companies convert the  password authentication to 2-step password authentica- tion. This is the best way to authenticate users. However we are thinking that for utilizing 2-step password authenti- cation more effectively, we must know more details about password authentication for protection our or company?s sensitive data.

The recommendations discussed in this paper also can help set the strong passwords. It means that if password authentication is converted to 2-step authentication, we can set a more strong password system.
