Busy Line Analysis with Improved Association Rules Mining Algorithm for Hangzhou Public

Abstract?In China, Hangzhou is the first city to set up the Public Free-Bicycle System. There are many and many technology problems in the decision of intelligent dispatch. In this paper, we investigate the busy line of Hangzhou Public Free- Bicycle System with association rules mining algorithm. Actually, finding association rules is an important data mining problem and can be derived based on mining large frequent candidate sets. In this paper, a new procedure is proposed for efficient generating busy lines candidate set. At first, by passing over the cruel database only once, a rent-return database with entries 1 or 0 are set up. Then, the busy locations and busy lines candidate sets are obtained from the rent-return database. Finally, busy lines are mined from the busy lines candidate sets. Practice examples and comparison with the Apriori Algorithm are made on 4 rent- return databases with small, middle and large sizes from the West Lake Scenic Zone. It is observed from the experiments that the proposed algorithm is efficient and robust.

I. INTRODUCTION  A. Brief introduction of Hangzhou Public Free-Bicycle System  A complimentary public free-bicycle sysytem, as a part of the public transport, is to be established in Hangzhou to solve the problem of the last 1km from the bus stop to home or work. Today, more that 2000 locations are set up.

In the West Lake Scenic Zone, there are 10 locations: Lingyin Temple Bus Interchange, Hangzhou Zoo Station, Nine Creeks Bus Interchange, South Entrance of Su Causeway, Wanghulou Tea House (next to Broken Bridge), car park of Shengtang main entrance, Gate 1 of Liulang Wenying Park (also known as Orioles Singing in the Willows), South Gate of Long Bridge Park, Pinghu Qiuyue Park on Bai Causeway (also known as Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake) and the entrance to Yue Miao (also known as Yuefei?s Temple).

20-50 bicycles are available for rental initially and num- bers will be adjusted according to the actual operational status at each location.

Anyone of over the age of 16 and under 70 are eligible for bicycle rental. However, no cash is accepted at the rental service locations.

Bus IC cards (either regular or concession cards) and citizen cards should be presented for bicycle rental. One card is eligible for one bicycle only and you should return the bicycle with the same card.

People should top up the card with 200 yuan as deposit to enjoy the service. The deposit can be refunded in the future if one want to cancel the service.

Tourists or citizens without bus IC cards can purchase a Z-card at 300 yuan, with 200 yuan as deposit and 100 yuan for consumption. You can be refunded the balance remaining in your Z-card within 10 days at any bicycle rental locations or bus IC card top up locations; however, refund over 10 days is only available in the ticketing office at Longxiangqiao Bus Interchange.

Z-card is available in any point of bus IC card sales and the bicycle rental locations. It can be used to pay bus fare at 9% discount, taxi fare (only for those installed with IC card POS) or water bus fare as well.

The first 30 minutes of bicycle rental is for free. 1 yuan is charged for rental from 30 minutes to 90 minutes, 2 yuan from 90 minutes to 150 minutes, 3 yuan per hour for over 150 minutes. It will be deducted from the IC card upon returning the bicycle.

The free rental period is prolonged from 30 minutes to 60 minutes for interchange from bus to bicycle. A discount will also be offered on bus fare for interchange from bicycle to bus once the system is ready.

B. Brief review of association rules mining  Discovering association rules from databases is an im- portant data mining problem[1]. Recently, there have been considerable researches in designing efficient algorithms for mining association rules.

The problem of mining association rules from a transac- tion database can be decomposed into two subproblems.Let the support of an itemset Z be the ratio of the number of  2010 Second WRI Global Congress on Intelligent Systems  DOI 10.1109/GCIS.2010.159   2010 Second WRI Global Congress on Intelligent Systems  DOI 10.1109/GCIS.2010.159   2010 Second WRI Global Congress on Intelligent Systems  DOI 10.1109/GCIS.2010.159   2010 Second WRI Global Congress on Intelligent Systems  DOI 10.1109/GCIS.2010.159   2010 Second WRI Global Congress on Intelligent Systems  DOI 10.1109/GCIS.2010.159     transactions containing itemset Z and the total number of transactions in the database.First, all itemsets whose supports are not less than the user-speci.ed minimum support are identi- fied. Each such itemset is referred to as a large itemset.Second , the association rules whose confidences are not less than the user-specified minimum confidence are generated from these large itemsets.For example, let Z be a large itemset.The confidence of a rule X ? Y is the ratio of the supports of itemset X ? Y and itemset X. All rules of the form X ? Y satisfying X ? Y = Z, X ? Y = ? and the minimum confidence constraint are generated.Once all large itemsets are discovered, the desired association rules can be obtained in a straightforward manner.

An algorithm for finding all association rules, referred to as the AIS algorithm, was first explored in [2]. The AIS algorithm requires to repeatedly scan the database. It uses the large itemsets discovered in the previous pass as the basis to generate new potentially large itemsets, called candidate itemsets, and counts their supports during the pass over the data. Specifically, after reading a transaction, it is determined which of the large itemsets found in the previous pass are contained in the transaction. New candidate itemsets are generated by extending these large itemsets with other items in the transaction. However, the performance study in [3] shows that AIS is not efficient since it generates too many candidate itemsets that are found not to be large itemsets finally.

In [3], the a priori algorithm was proposed for efficiently mining association rules. Different from the AIS algorithm, the algorithm generate the candidate itemsets by using only the large itemsets found in the previous pass. For example, at the (k ? 1)th iteration, all large itemsets containing (k ? 1) items, called large (k ? 1)-itemsets, are generated. In the next iteration, the candidate itemsets containing k items are generated by joining large (k?1)-itemsets. The heuristic is that any subset of a large itemset must be large. By the heuristic, the a priori algorithm can generate a much smaller number of candidate itemsets than the AIS algorithm.

Another effective algorithm for the candidate set gener- ation, called DHP, was proposed in [4]. By utilizing a hash technique, DHP can efficiently generate all the large itemsets and effectively reduce the size of the transaction database.The performance study in [4] shows that the number of candidate 2-itemsets generated by DHP is smaller than that by the a priori algorithm. Moreover, the transaction database size is trimmed at a much earlier stage of the iterations. As a result, the total execution time can be reduced significantly by DHP.

In [5], the PSI and PSIseq algorithms were proposed for efficient large itemsets generation and large sequences generation, respectively. The two algorithms use prestored information to minimize the numbers of candidate itemsets and candidate sequences counted in each database scan.The prestored informations for PSI and PSIseq include the item- sets and the sequences along with their support counts found in the last mining, respectively.Empirical results show that only using little storage space for the prestored information, the total computation time can be reduced effectively. In  [6], an efficient graph-based algorithm to discover interesting association rules embedded in the transaction database and the customer database is presented.

The notion of mining multiple-level association rules was introduced in [7].In many applications, association rules discovered at multiple concept levels are useful.Usually, the association relationship expressed at a lower concept level provides more specific information than that expressed at a higher concept level.The approach is to first find large items at the top-most level, and then progressively deepen the mining process into their descendants at lower levels. A similar idea of extracting generalized association rules using a taxonomy was presented in [8].

The issue of mining quantitative association rules in large relational databases was investigated in [9]. The attributes considered in a relation are quantitative or categorical.The values of the attribute are partitioned using an equi ? depth approach (that is, each interval resulted from the partition contains roughly the same number of tuples), and then adjacent intervals are combined as necessary. A related problem is clus- tering association rules [10], which combines similar adjacent association rules to form a few general rules. Ref.[10] pro- posed a geometric-based algorithm to perform the clustering and applied the minimum description length principle as a means of evaluating clusters.

Previous researches on mining association rules focus on discovering the relationships among items in the transaction database. Lots of papers are mentioned on algorithms for mining association rules, such as [11-16].

In this paper, a new algorithm for finding association rules is used to analysis busy line for Hangzhou free bicycle system.

By passing over the database once, we can get the training database. The frequent itemsets can then be obtained from the operations of rows on this matrix, (see in section 3).

The rest of these paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we give a review of the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining and present the limitations of Apriori algorithm. In section 3, we present the new proposed algorithm for finding association rules, called Matrix Algorithm(SA) . In section 4, we discuss the concrete experiments using the new algorithm.

Conclusions are given in section 5.



II. BUSY LINE MINING BASED ON RENT-RETURN MATRIX  We first generate a matrix with only entries either 0 or 1 after one pass over the rent-return database. We call it rent- return matrix. Then we can derive association rules from the matrix. The process of generating the matrix is as follows: We set the locations in I as columns and the rent-return transactions as rows of the matrix.

Let the set of locations be I = {p1, p2, ? ? ? , pn}, and the set of the rent-return records be D = {t1, t2, ? ? ? , tm}.

Then the rent-return matrix G = {gij}, (i = 1, 2, ? ? ? ,m; j = 1, 2, ? ? ? , n) is an m ? n matrix, where gij = 0 or 1 is     determined by the following rule,  gij =  ?? ?  1, if pj ? ti,  0, if pj /? ti.

Example 1. Let I = {A,B, C, D, E, F} with five loca-  tions, and the rent-return transactions be t1 = {A,B}, t2 = {A,C}, t3 = {B,E}, t4 = {C, D}, t5 = {D, E} with six rent-return records. Then the rent-return matrix is  G =  ? ?????  1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0  ? ?????  ?  ? ?????  g1 g2 g3 g4 g5  ? ?????  .

With this rent-return matrix, we can find busy line and generate association lines.

The busy lines candidate set is generated using the fol- lowing process:  (a) The busy locations set L1 is a subset of candidate busy locations set which consists of the sets which are subsets of single location in I , that is, C1 = {{p1}, {p2}, ? ? ? , {pn}}.

In order to compute the support number for each set in C1, we express every set in C1 as a row vector in Rn, that is, we express {p1} as S11 = {1, 0, ? ? ? , 0}, and {pk} as S1k = {0, 0, ? ? ? , 1, ? ? ? , 0}, the kth element is 1 and others are 0.

Then the support number of the set {pk} is calculated by :  supp({pk}) = m?  j=1  < gj , S k >,  where < , > is the inner product of two row vectors and gj , j = 1, 2, ..., m are rows of the matrix G. For example, let g1 = {1, 0, 1}. Then if S11 = {1, 0, 0},< g1, S11 >= 1 and if S12 = {0, 1, 0}, then < g1, S12 >= 0. Then the set of all the frequent 1-itemsets, L1, is generated from C1. If the support number of {pk} is beyond the user-specified threshold Minsupport, that is,  supp({pk}) ? Minsupport, then {pk} ? L1.

(b) The set of candidate busy lines set C2 is the joint set of L1 with itself, that is, C2 = L1 ?? L1. Each subset in C2 consists of two locations and has the form {pk, pj}, k < j.

Similarly, we specify each set in C2 a row vector in Rn. For example, for the set {pk, pj}, the specified vector is S2k,j = {0, ? ? ? , 0, 1, 0, ? ? ? , 0, 1, 0, ? ? ? , 0}, where the kth and jth elements are 1 and others are 0. The support number of the set {pk, pj} is :  supp({pk, pj}) = m?  s=1  int[ < gs, S  i,k >  ],  where int[?] is the integrating function that changes a real number to integer by discarding the number after decimal point. For example, int[0.6] = 0, and int[2.3] = 2.

The busy lines L2 is generated from C2 with the set whose support number is beyond the user specified threshold Minsupport, that is, if  supp({pk, pj}) ? Minsupport then {pk, pj} ? L2.

The busy lines set L2 is obtained.

We set  L = L1 ? L2.

Throughout the process above only one pass over the rent- return database is used, and hence the algorithm is called matrix algorithm.



III. BUSY LINES GENERATING  In this section, we derive all busy lines  {pi ? pj} with support s and confidence c, where pi, pj are busy locations and {pi}, {pj}, {pi, pj} ? L.

The s = Minconfidence and the c = Minsupport are specified by users or experts. The confidence of busy line pi ? pj is computed by the following statement,  conf(pi ? pj) = supp({pi, pj}) supp({pi}) .

The method of generating all busy lines are to select all {pi}, {pi, pj} from L, then compute conf(pi ? pj). If conf(pi ? pj) is beyond the Minconfidence, pi ? pj is a busy line. In another word, the busy lines generating framework is ????  ???  supp({pi}) ? s, supp({pj}) ? s, supp({pi, pj}) ? s, supp({pi,pj})  supp({pi}) ? c.

Then, we can design algorithm to get them.



IV. PRACTICAL EXAMPLES  To practice the effectiveness of the proposed procedure, we performed extensive practical experiments.

We get all of the rent-return records in one weeks. In Table 1, we list out the rent-return database scale. n is the number of locations in I . m is the rent-return records number in D.

Table 1: the database scale  Practical example n m E1 10 500 E2 100 5000 E3 500 50000 E4 1000 500000  In Table 2, is the comparison result between The Apriori Algorithm and our Proposed procedure with cpu times to generate frequent itemsets.

Table 2: Experimental results  Practical example Apriori Proposed procedure E3 34.07sec 28.56sec E4 83.12sec 73.26sec  The following conclusion can be obtained from the prac- tice examples .

For the small size problem, for example, size is smaller than one hundred, the difference between the Apriori Algo- rithm and the proposed procedure is not obvious. But for large or huge size locations and rent-return records, for example, number is larger than one thousand, the difference is obviously.

For generation of the busy locations, the proposed pro- cedure takes more time than the Apriori Algorithm. But, for generation of the busy lines, the proposed procedure take less time than the Apriori Algorithm.
