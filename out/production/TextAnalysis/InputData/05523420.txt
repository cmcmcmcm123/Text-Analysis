The Mining Method of the Road Traffic Illegal Data Based on Rough Sets and  Association Rules

Abstract?Based on the daily operation data of the urban road traffic management system, this paper analysis the demand of data mining of the traffic violations, pre-processes the data to data sets by the detection methods of proximity-based outlier.

According to the characteristics of data traffic offense, combining the advantages of rough sets and association rules data mining, proposed two methods based on the joint data mining method. Finally, a city in the year 2008 road traffic management data, for example, using the text method, regularity of the traffic offense causes were analyzed, indicating that the method is effective.

I.  INTRODUCTION With the rapid development of ITS, digital road traffic  management becomes an inevitable trend. For the road traffic management sector, the completion of different functions in the development of the traffic management system, the face of the accumulated large amounts of data, a simple query and modify data, all of these relying on intuition for decision-makers traffic management decision- making, has failed to meet the demand, need to adopt data mining analysis found that the potential relationship between the data.[1-2]  Data mining technology has been studied and applied in the field of traffic management. In road traffic management, mainly at the theoretical level, the study will address the data transport features of database systems, traffic management and data mining platform, system framework and design; in traffic accidents cause analysis, mainly for rough set theory [3-4], association rules, and gray system approach to a specific application.



II. DATA PREPROCESSING BASED ON ANOMALY DETECTION  A. Database of data mining Faced with increasingly rapid growth of traffic  management data, internal traffic management departments of many cities has integrated constructed the traffic management data: completed the traffic police law system, penalties for traffic police off-site system, traffic police incident processing system, traffic police driving them the  data management systems, etc.[5] real-time information automatically collected, and built a centralized repository to access the data center consolidation, with the data for the comprehensive utilization of the operational data base. This paper studies have relied on data sheet for the driver database, illegal motor vehicles off-site databases, and the driver on- site law database.

B. The demand of data mining for traffic violate Through the analysis of historical data, use the  management of vehicles and drivers to provide relevant statistical data for the relevant departments of the vehicle, the driver management of digital information as an auxiliary.

The following are the major elements:  1 the analysis of traffic violate type Analysis the historical data on traffic models, time,  location type to reflect the traffic violate and accident statistics in different situations, auxiliary reflect the vehicle driving characteristics and mechanical properties for vehicle management vetting and traffic management to provide supplementary support in order to improve management.

2 analysis the composition of the traffic violated people  Analysis the driver's age, driving experience, gender, type of work and other information in order to statistically analysis the illegal the time, location type, type of driving a vehicle in different situations, reflecting the driver's share of various types of illegal incidents, auxiliary driver training to provide targeted learning content, and determine the corresponding transport publicity strategies and promotional focus.

3 comparative analysis between traffic accidents and weather, time, road type  Illegal types of traffic analysis of historical data to reflect the kinds of cases, the traffic offense type as shown in the weight-assisted driver training.

4 analysis the situation of traffic violate and driver Illegal types of traffic analysis of historical data to reflect  the kinds of cases that the account of the drivers? specific physical and psychological situation (drinking, tired, illness, happiness, sadness).

C. Anomaly detection theory In the traffic management data analysis, the pros and  cons of the data quality has a direct impact on the deep-level mining, data preprocessing is an indispensable process[6,7,8].

DOI 10.1109/ICICTA.2010.803     The data pre-processing techniques generally include data cleansing, data filling, data integration, data conversion of several main parts. Anomaly detection theory commonly used statistical methods, based on proximity outlier detection, detection based on clustering technology. In this paper, based on proximity outlier detection methods, which can solve the statistical distribution model to bring the satisfaction of the restrictions, while easy to use, when an object far away from most of the points when the object is the exception. Specific principles are as follows:  You can use the k-nearest neighbor distance to measure an object is far away from most of the points, that is, an object of the outlier points to its score from the k-nearest neighbor distance is given. Outliers? scores highly sensitive to the values of k, if k is too small, then the small number of adjacent outliers may lead to lower scores. If k is too large then the points is less than k clusters in all the objects may have become outliers. Algorithm operation is generally the first, depending on the application, delete non-relevant attributes, to identify key attributes. Then from the distance, the density or characteristics to determine the other points away from the isolation, from the dissimilarity of data to determine differences between different points and thus determine the outliers. Finally, key properties into a matrix, according to above-average dissimilarity of the outliers of the size of the order, ahead of the front and the final score a few points, the largest and the possibility of becoming the biggest outliers.

D. the example of data pre-processing Based on data from routine traffic management in 2008  full year of a city, in order from the time dimension analysis of the efficiency of traffic management staff and abnormal conditions, according to two data sets already in the field  through data preprocessing, get 10 export fields. Licensing moment, driving permit issued moment of registration certificate issued moment, certificate of compliance time, update time and its relationship with the initial time interval between the date of registration in order to improve efficiency of operation and does not break the law for the original data, from the total sample randomly selected from 4916 records exception tests the final test results shown in Figure 1.

We can see from the figure recorded in 4916, find 49 found abnormal records, abnormal records will be divided into two groups, Group 1 found 12 records, the second group found 37 records, the details of each group as shown in Figure 2.

III. DATA MINING MODEL BASED ON ROUGH SETS AND ASSOCIATION RULES  A. rough sets theory Rough set theory can in the absence of a priori  knowledge and without any prior knowledge of the data or subjective assessment of the condition, using only the information contained in the data itself, analyze objectively and effectively and deal with imprecise, uncertain and incomplete data, and discovered implicit knowledge, reveal the law of the potential.

Using rough set theory for decision analysis, that is, from a given data set to obtain usable information, from the rough set model built up in raw data, through data compression, reduction, the importance of attribute analysis methods to can generate a reasonable decision-making program.

Rough set theory is given to discuss property-dependent methods. Suppose S = (U A F) is information system,  , if , The attribute set B is called depends on the attribute set C, this is C . If C B and . The attribute set B is called with the attribute set C is equivalent. If the attribute set Q depends on the attribute set P, in the information system, Q derived from the attribute set of knowledge is superfluous. In this situation,  and P provide the same knowledge (object features).

Sometimes, the dependences of attribute set is partly, it means that the only part of the knowledge derived from the set Q were determined the knowledge of set P, this part of the relationship can be derived from the knowledge of the relationship between the positive domain to characterize.

,B C A CR RB B  B C  P Q  In decision-making table, different attributes may have different importance. For example, when the symptoms described by the patient's situation, It is significant to identify the physical condition of some of the symptoms the patient In order to determine a property of importance in the system, you can remove this attribute from the table, after the systematic classification , how kind of changes will occur considering without this property. If remove the corresponding classification of the property changed greatly, then the property in the system is more important, otherwise, the property is not very important.

B.  Association Rules theory Data mining association rules is a typical method, a large  number of traffic accidents can be studied in the correlation between different events, if the two events appear in the same time, they think that they are closely related; probably one of the incident was caused by another event.

Agrawal in 1993 first proposed an association theory mining customer transaction database item set association rules and designed a basic algorithm, the core is a recursive method based on the frequency of set theory.

(1) The basic idea of Algorithm The basic idea of Algorithm is, first, identify all the  frequent sets, and then set the frequency generated by the strong association rules.

(2) Core description of the algorithm Apriori  Algorithm Apriori was put forward in 1994, the basic idea is scan the database repeat. A brief description of its core programs are as follows,  L1 = { large 1 - itemsets}; for ( k = 2; Lk - 1 <; k ++ ) do begin Ck = apriori_gen (Lk - 1 ) ; the new candidate set for all transactions t D do begin Ct = subset (Ck , t) ; the candidate set of t is included  in t do for all candidates c Ct c. count ++ ; end Lk = { c Ck | c.count  minsup} end Answer = k  k  L  C.  conjoint analyses based on rough sets and Association Rules The above-mentioned two kinds of traffic data mining,  although it can analysis the causes of traffic violations and regularity from a different perspective, methods have their own characteristics, can not independently accomplish the cause of mining traffic comprehensive, multi-angled and multi-level mining traffic offense and regularity of the task.

In this paper, two kinds of single-edge mining technology proposed data analysis model of rough set - Association Rules, the basic procedure is, first, the use of rough set theory and method of analysis of the information contained in the Road Traffic violations in which information elements are most likely to affect the production of traffic violations, this is, which factor in a closer relationship with the traffic offense, and according to an important degree of factor weights to sort; Secondly, the use of association rules mining method in the top few elements of what kind of state were more likely to lead to the occurrence of traffic violations.

Specific analysis process was shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3.  Mining Analysis Process  D. Statistical analysis of the traffic offenses Based on traffic violate data regularly in the whole year  of 2008, take violate behavior as decision attribute, take month and week ordinal of violate, code of vehicle type, date, plate type code, week and moment of violate as condition attribute, use the method of rough sets theory to get the weight of condition attribute showing in figure 6-3. Select the previous five condition attributes the analysis of association rules as condition attributes. The analysis results of principles of association rules are shown in Figure 4.
