An Adaptive Channel Number Tuning Mechanism on  Parallel Transfer with UDT

Abstract? Utilizing available bandwidth is a big challenge with advance of high bandwidth network infrastructures and devices.

Especially, parallel protocol which creates multi-connections aims to maximize data transfer rate in a HBDP(High Bandwidth Delay Product) network. It is a critical issue to decide the number of optimum channels according to network environment variations. In this paper, we deal with an adaptive channel number tuning mechanism to decide the number of optimum channels on parallel transfer with UDT(UDP based Data Transfer protocol). Data transfer distance and network congestion are prominent network variants. They can be generally represented into RTT(Round Trip Time). We firstly conduct a theoretical analysis to investigate the impact of data transfer distance on the number of parallel channels, and present it as an equation. Then, we discuss about an adaptive channel number tuning algorithm to decide the number of optimal channels which may reflect the network status. The experimental results show our proposed method really rigorous in HBDP network.

I.  INTRODUCTION High speed networks providing multi-Gbps link capacity  have been dramatically developing and wide spreading between the end users to support data intensive applications.

But, for most applications, data transfer rate are restricted to few of Mbps. This is caused by using TCP which has been widely deployed data transfer protocol. It was designed to support the reliability of data transfer. It has been proved to be remarkably successful in the Internet. However, it is not suitable in HBDP network environment because of its AIMD(Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease) congestion control mechanism which is inherently not able to effectively utilize a given available bandwidth[1][2].

Several UDP-based researches have been tried to overcome TCP transfer rate limitation in HBDP network environment.

These protocols include SAUBL(Simple Available Bandwidth Utilization Library)[3], RBUDP(Reliable Blast UDP)[4], Thusnami, PAUDP(Performance Adaptive UDP)[5], UDT (UDP based Data Transfer)[6]. UDP-based protocols make use of UDP protocol and add a supportive congestion control algorithm in application layer functioning such as TCP?s  reliable data transfer. In addition, these use a rate congestion control which updates the packet-sending period every constant interval; if the packets are transmitted to a receiver without any packet loss, then one ACK is delivered from the receiver.

These UDP-based protocols show significantly outstanding performance than that of TCP, and are generally considered as an alternative data transfer means for HBDP network environment.

On the other hand, the specifications of host system have been also developing to maximize the data transfer rate. Above all, the advance of microprocessor plays a big role to process the work. In [7], authors proposed a new transport method which utilizes multiple parallel UDP connections to take advantage of the full power of multicore processors. With this, it is possible to process incoming packets more efficiently, so it is resulting in a good performance. However, most of parallel- based approaches including the above work simply presented a theoretical model in the restricted network environments. As a result, the efforts to find out the number of optimum parallel channels is based on empirical simulation results. In order to utilize UDP-based parallel data transfer more efficiently, it needs a more sophisticate mechanism to control the number of channels according to its network status. In other words, the sender which finally decides the number of optimum channels should be considered with network environment parameters including network congestion, data transfer distance and host system specifications.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive channel number tuning algorithm which effectively reflects network status. We implemented a parallel transfer protocol based on UDT library which is the most commonly used UDP-based data transfer protocol. The main function is to implement a management module of multi-thread which transmits packets simultaneously.

Then, a supportive function is provided to tune these multi- connections with the network status, that is, RTT. RTT can be mainly classified into two folders. One is based on the data transfer distance, which it is proportionally increased as far as the distance from sender and the receiver. The other is to reflect the network congestion which is more comprehensive because it is influenced by numerous network parameters. To do this, we firstly conduct a theoretical analysis to investigate the impact of data transfer distance on the number of parallel channels, and present an equation. Then, we suggest an  Jongseon Park, Dosik An, and Gihwan Cho? Div. of Computer Science and Engineering,  Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, S.

The corresponding author     adaptive tuning algorithm to finally decide the optimum number of channels which effectively the network status.

The rest of the document is organized as follow. Chapter II describes the parallel UDT transfer protocol. In chapter III, we propose an adaptive tuning mechanism to decide the optimum number of parallel data channels. Chapter IV presents the simulation results and chapter V concludes the study.



II. PARALLEL UDT PROTOCOL UDT is originally planned to make up the poor  performance of TCP. The most primary lure of this is that users are able to implement additional functions to facilitate data transfer rate. Also, the congestion control algorithm can be easily adjusted with considering its network environments[10].

It is well-known that parallel transfer improves data transfer rate by transmitting a data aggressively using multi-channels.

As a result, it makes the a data transfer tool to utilize maximum available network link capacity given by a high speed network[8][9].

In this paper, we consider a parallel UDT which  implements the parallel transfer technique to make its data transfer rate more outstanding. In the case of using single channel, the sender has to wait for ACK to transmit next packet.

On the other hand, with multi-channels, it can have a more better chance to transmit packets continuously to different channels. As a result, the amount of packets to be transmitted will be increased for a given time than that of single channel.

Fig. 1 shows a conceptual architecture of proposed parallel UDT.

As shown in Fig. 1, data is transmitted from the sender to the receiver. In addition, control channel and data channel are differentiated respectively to stability of data transfer. Data moves from the sender to the receiver along the solid line, and control information is handed from the receiver to the sender along the doted line. UDT only takes charge of transmitting packets through each channel. So, we additively implement a supportive function to manage multiple control information through the TCP. File block manager functions to control data blocks to be transmitted from disk and verifies the sequence number of blocks. In the sender, it loads data blocks from disk into the send buffer, and the loaded blocks are transmitted from the sender to the receiver through each connections. In receiver, data blocks incoming through each channels arrives and moves  into the receive buffer. Then, file block manager checks the sequence number of incoming blocks and verifies it. If there are no data losses, the data blocks are forwarded into the disk and control information is handed to a sender. Among these control information, the auto tuner extracts RTT and utilizes it to decide the optimum number of parallel channels.  In chapter III, we discuss it in more detail in term of adaptive channel number tuning mechanism.



III. ADAPTIVE CHANNEL NUMBER TUNING MECHANISM In implementing the parallel data transfer protocol, the  most important thing is to decide optimum number of channels.

It basically needs to be presented with suitable theoretical models. If appropriate parallel connections are created, the performance will be proportionally increased alongside the number of channels, so it results in efficiently utilizing available bandwidth. However, in the case of congested network environment, it may lead to consecutive data losses resulting in a poor performance. RTT is the most significant network environment parameter to estimate network status, which can be summarized as follow.

? Data transfer distance: The RTT can range from a few milliseconds(thousandths of a second) under ideal conditions between closely spaced points to several seconds under adverse conditions between points separated by a large distance.

? Network congestion: When network status is congested with many packets in a bottleneck link, the data rate of a flow is limited in delay. So, in this case, measured RTT value will be larger than that of normal.

? Host system specification: The system specification is another key component to delay data transfer. With a good host specification, packets incoming into a receive buffer are processed more efficiently.

When the sender decides the number of optimum channels, it can consider RTT from the receiver which is influenced with the above network environment parameters. Our work starts to firstly conduct a theoretical analysis to investigate the impact of data transfer distance.

A. Theoritical Channel Prediction Model HBDP is commonly known as a long fat network, it is more  useful to utilize the parallel technique. BDP refers to the product of a data link capacity(bandwidth) and its delay(RTT/2), which is presented as the below equation.

DelayBandwidthBDP ??  As a result, an amount of packets to be transmitted is equivalent to the maximum amount of data on the network link at any given time. So, parallel-based transfer in HBDP can be really helpful to maximize its transfer rate.

To theoretical analysis according to the RTT, we organize a real network environment as shown in Fig. 2. Data is transmitted from host1 to host 2 ~ host 4, and all hosts are connected to each other with 1Gbps network link capacity.

Network emulator(WANem)[11] locates between host1     Figure 1. Concetual architecture of the parallel UDT       and switch to intentionally modify of RTT. The experimental results are aggregated in a specified RTT section from 1.5ms to 400ms. Along with this, the number of channels is changed from 1 to 20 in each RTT section.

All host systems are equipped with different system specifications, which are summarized as shown in Table I.

For each file transfer, we have done at least 20 times and calculated their average throughput.

TABLE I. HOST SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS  Memory CPU OS Host 1 Xeon 2.83 8 GB Ubuntu 10.04 Host 2 i5 760 4 GB Ubuntu 10.04 Host 3 i5 650 4 GB Ubuntu 10.04 Host 4 i5 2500 8 GB Ubuntu 10.04    TABLE II presents an optimum channel number which shows the highest data transfer rate in each host according to RTT respectively. With Table II, we found out that the number of parallel channels is increased proportionally as RTT is getting bigger. Especially, a great change is shown from 1.5ms to 50ms than that of any other RTT sections.

We can confirm that the parallel technique is more effective in this RTT section. In other RTT sections, its change is a little bit moderate.

TABLE II. OPTIMUM CHANNEL NUMBER SHOWING THE HIGHEST TRANSFER RATE IN EACH HOST  RTT(ms) Host 2 Host 3 Host 4 1.5 6 5 5 50 11 12 11 100 12 12 13 150 133 14 14 200 14 14 15 250 15 15 15 300 16 16 16 350 17 18 17 400 17 18 17   Based on the above analysis, we know the number of  parallel channels increases proportionally with RTT in different hosts. With this fact, we propose a theoretical channel prediction model to optimum data transfer rate according to the RTT change, without considering any packet losses and network congestion. Therefore, we present a mathematical equation reflecting its correlation between the number of parallel channels and RTT. A  regression analysis is a commonly useful method to present a theoretical approach based on the actual testing results. Through the results of Table II, we can estimate increasing aspect in phase of each RTT sections. For example, the increasing amount of channels in each RTT sections appears curvilinear for all hosts. In this case, logarithmic-based approach to make equation is suitable.

General logarithmic-based equation is represented as below.

bxay ??? )ln(  x represents the independent variable and y the dependent variable. And, the coefficients a, b are calculated by using the method of least squares.  Based on the measured results of Table II, we can easily extract the equations for all hosts respectively as shown below.

To get the final equation, named OPCN(Optimum Parallel Channel Number), we calculate the average of all equations and present it as shown below.

3746.4)ln(0038.2 ?? rttOPCN  To verification of this equation, we input RTT from 1.5ms to 400ms in order. Table III shows calculated results by using this equation, where all values are a rounding value.

TABLE III. OPCN CALCULATED  BY THE EQUATION  RTT(ms) OPCN 1.5 5 50 12 100 13 150 14 200 15 250 15 300 16 350 16 400 16   From the results of TABLE III, an optimum channel  number in RTT section from 1.5ms to 50ms is increased abruptly comparing with any other RTT sections. In other RTT sections, its change is more moderate. This shows that the theoretical channel prediction model has an equivalent result with comparing the experimental results in TABLE II. So, we believe our modeling is valuable enough to use it as a theoretical equation.

B. Adaptive Channel  Tuning Mechanism We make use of the equation presented above as a prediction  model to decide the number of channels according to the RTT.

This equation should be adaptively tuned further with considering the network status.

Figure 2. Network environment to theoretical analysis according to RTT     The optimum number of channels is based solely on RTT.

So, it is the first stage to measure current RTT before creating a channel. In Fig. 1, an auto tuner module provides some functions to create new connections and takes over the information that is a current RTT measured by the receiver.

Based on this information, the sender can finally decide the optimum parallel data channels.

yes  no  no  yes  yes  nono  CHNcur ++  START  RTT measure  RTTmin<RTTcur  RTTcur < RTTpre  CHN = OPCN (RTTmin)  RTTdiff = |RTTcur? RTTpre|  confix + 1  RTTmin = min{RTTt-i, ? , RTTt}  confix = 0  confix = 0  RTTmin = RTTcur  END  RTTpre = RTTcur  CHNcur < CHN+thre  RTTdiff < ?  CHNcur > CHN-thre  CHNcur --  confix ? ?  yes  no  yes  no  yes  yes yes  yes   Figure 3. The adaptive channel number tuning mechanism  Fig 3 shows the adaptive channel number tuning mechanism with considering distance and network congestion. It can be explained as follow.

1) Upon arrival of control packet including current RTT measured by the receiver, the sender compares it with minimum RTT which is a originally user-defined value.

In the first stage, current RTT is decided as a mimimum RTT. It goes directly to the OPCN(RTTmin) stage and decides the number of channels and substitutes RTTpre with RTTcur, otherwise goes to step 2.

2) If RTTmin < RTTcur, calculates RTTdiff which is an absolute value as RTTcur?RTTpre. We consider that the network status is sometimes very irregular, and make use of a threshold ? to compare it with RTTdiff. If RTTdiff value is bigger than ?, network congestion is considered to be temporal. Otherwise, network congestion last for a  long time and fixed. If RTTdiff < ?, the confix that stands consgestion fix increaments count is increased by 1 and goes to step 3, otherwise sets the confix value with 0 and goes step 4.

3) Compares the confix value with ?. If it exceeds the ?, extracts a new minimum RTT among previous RTTs, otherwise goes to step 4. Then, goes to OPCN(RTTmin) and decides an optimum channel number.

4) Compares current RTT with previous RTT. According to this result, whether the number of channels increases or not is decided. If RTTcur < RTTpre, the number of current channels is increased because it means that the current network status more favorable than previous. Otherwise goes to step 5. It is needed to regulate the number of channels to be increased. If it is exceeded the threshold, maintains the previous channel number.

5) This situation means that current network status is more congested than previous, which decreases the number of current channels.

We summarized this channel number tuning mechanism as a simple pseudo code as follow.

Pseudocode1 : auto tuner 1: 2: 3: 4: 5: 6: 7: 8: 9: 10: 11: 12: 13: 14: 15: 16: 17: 18: 19: 20: 21: 22: 23: 24: 25: 26: 27: 28: 29: 30: 31:  Parameter auto tuner( ) RTTcur = RTT measure( ); If RTTmin is smaller than RTTcur  RTTdiff = absolute(RTTcur - RTTpre); If RTTdiff is smaller than ?  confix += 1; If confix is larger than ?  RTTmin = minimum{RTTt-1, ?, RTTt}; CHN = OPCN (RTTmin); confix = 0;  Otherwise, If RTTcur is smaller than RTTpre  If CHNcur is smaller than CHNmaxinc CHN = channel is increase( );  Otherwise, If CHNcur is larger than CHNmaxinc  CHN = channel is decrease( ); Otherwise,  confix = 0; If RTTcur is smaller than RTTpre  If CHNcur is smaller than CHNmaxinc CHN = channel is increase( );  Otherwise, If CHNcur is larger than CHNmaxinc  CHN = channel is decrease( ); Otherwise,  RTTmin = RTTcur; CHN = OPCN (RTTmin); confix = 0;  RTTpre = RTTcur; Return CHN;

IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION For validating the proposed method, we make use of the  real network environment shown in Fig. 2. The proposed method is compared with the UDT(version 4.7) and parallel TCP over a local link. The proposed method is tested in two cases; one is a parallel UDT based on OPCN and the other is an adaptive channel number tuning of parallel UDT(ACT parallel UDT). Two host systems is identically equipped with l Gigabit NIC, i5 760 processor, 4 GByte of RAM and Ubuntu 10.04 operating system. WANem is used to intentionally modify RTT, which is changed from 1ms to 400ms. The file size used is 4 Gbyte and all experiments are performed 20 times to get average throughputs.

Figure 4. Throughput comparison with jitter 20%   Figure 5. Throughput comparison with jitter 40%  Fig. 4 presents an experimental result measured in each RTT section, which jitter is used to intentionally modify RTT much like as a real network environment. In this experiment, jitter is set with 20% of original RTT.

For example, it will be randomly changed from 100ms to 120ms in the case of 100ms RTT section. All protocols show high transfer rate in low RTT section. In TCP, the data transfer rate is dramatically decreased as RTT is increased. It is well known that this is caused by AIMD congestion control algorithm of TCP. Single UDT is more rigorous than that of TCP in each RTT section. Most of UDP-based data transfer protocols including UDT show high transfer rate in HBDP with benefit of its rate based congestion control. The Parallel UDT shows higher data transfer rate as RTT increases. This confirms that parallel- based data transfer is really helpful in HBDP network.

The ACT Parallel UDT which includes an adaptive channel  number tuning shows the highest data transfer rate than that of the other protocols, but a little bit higher than that of the Parallel UDT.

Fig. 5 is a experimental results measured in same environment, but the jitter is changed to 40%. The result shows nearly the same, but there are some differences between Parallel UDT and ACT Parallel UDT. As RTT increases, ACT parallel UDT shows high performance than that of Parallel UDT. With this, we can confirm that ACT Parallel UDT shows 644%, 135%, 7% improvement than that of TCP, single UDT and parallel UDT respectively.



V. CONCLUSION Utilizing multiple connections in HBDP network is really  helpful to efficiently utilize available bandwidth. But, it is a critical issue to decide the number of optimum channels according to network environment variation. Most existing researches on parallel-based data transfer analyzed it depending on empirical methods. In this paper, we proposed an adaptive channel number tuning mechanism. To do this, we firstly conducted a theoretical analysis to investigate the impact of data transfer distance on the number of parallel channels and formalized the result into an equation. Based on this result, an adaptive channel number tuning mechanism is proposed. The performance superiority of proposed method was verified by the experimental results measured in a real network environment. For the future work, we are going to keep elaborating the proposed  method with taking account of local host system.
