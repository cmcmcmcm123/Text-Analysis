The Data Protection of MapReduce Using  Homomorphic Encryption

Abstract-MapReduce is a programming model which can handle  big data efficiently, but the security of intermediate data of Map Reduce is not well protected, and the operations on ciphertexts were not allowed. To achieve a trustworthy Map Reduce, there is a need to both protect the data ,as well as to allow specific types of computations to be carried out on encrypted intermediate data. Traditional encryption solutions can protect the data from being divulged, but they can't be used to compute on encrypt data, however a novel encryption scheme,  called fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), could compute over encrypted data without decrypting it. In this paper, we propose a modified framework of Map Reduce using homomorphic encryption, in order to gain both the confidentiality of data, as well as the ability of computing on them.

I. INTRODUCTION  MapReduce is a programming model which can process large data sets efficiently. Hundreds of MapReduce programs have been implemented and upwards of one thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google's clusters everyday.

Firstly, MapReduce takes a set of input key/value pairs, and produces a set of intermediate key/value pairs. Secondly, MapReduce will group together the same key and pass them to the Reduce. And then Reduce will merge these values. In this process, the data of intermediate files are out of protecting, which make the data owner worry about the data confidentiality, if we encrypt the data using traditional encryption, computation will not be allowed on encrypted data and we therefore can't do any operation before Map or Reduce function. For e.g., we want to count the number of each word in lots of documents, but the word is dirty , before inputing Map function , we should do some operations on the source data to get valuable information, however the data was encrypted , we can't do any computation unless we decrypt it.

Fortunately, there're some homomorphic schemes to support computations on encrypted data[1][2ITS][6]. In these schemes,  given ciphertexts lfIl,???,lfIn that encrypts plaintexts 7Tp ... ,7T 'f 7Tp ... ,7T h fi n ,l one want to compute over n, e can Irst  compute over lfIl' ... , lfIn ,and then decrypt the result. If we use this encryption scheme to encrypt the intermediate data of MapRudece, we can then do functions which include add or    Qiming Huang Department of Computer and Communication University o/Science and Technology Beijing  100083, China qmhuangcn@163.com  multiply on ciphertexts correctly, with no information about  7Tp ... , 7Tn .This not only protect the data confidentiality, but also keep the ability to operate data. In this paper, we propose a universal construction framework of MapReduce with key works as follows:  First, the function Reduce need to find the same keys and gether them, however the keys are encrypted and the ciphertexts are generally not equal even when they encrypt the same plaintexts, so we propose a method to find the same key on ciphertexts.

Second, we sketch out a prototype of Map Reduce which can be used under homomorphic encryption. This prototype brings in a transform module before Reduce function, which can find the same key on ciphertexts.

This paper is organized as follows. We'll describe the homomorphic encryption in Section 2,and Section 3 will describe MapReduce, and then we will propose our framework in Section 4.At last, we conclude our work and tell some other related works in Section 5.

IT. FULLY HOMOMORPHIC ENCRYPTION  Fully homomorphic encryption was first propose by Gentry in 2009[1][3], The scheme include key generation algorithm  KeyGens encryption algorithm Encrypts ,decryption  algorithm Decrypts' and computing algorithm Evaluates'  To make the result of computation on ciphertexts equal to the encryption of the same operate on plaintexts,  Decrypts (sk, Evaluates (pk, C, lfI)) = C(7T) .Gentry brings in algorithm, called bootstrap, which can recrypt the same plaintext using another public key without decryption.

And then he bootstrap the ciphertexts before every evaluation, in order to make the decryption correctly. In 2010, another fully homomorphic encryption scheme called Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Integers [2] was proposed.

This scheme was more concise. The main process of these homomorphic encryption schemes are like figure 1.

Generate key  Encrypt data  Bootstrap the ciphertexts to get fr esh ciphertexts  More evaluate  No evaluate  * decrypt  Figure 1 In order to be used in MapReduce, we use the homomorphic  encryption as follows, which is a public key encryption scheme:  We choose two big prime numbers A, B, and make P=A*B, and then we choose a random positive integer A, A is the secret key, and B should also be remain under cover.

Encryption:  C = (M + A * Ar) mod P (1)  Decryption:  M= CmodA (2) We can prove the properties of homomorphic of this scheme  as follows:  Given two ciphertexts ci ? (ml + A * Ar,) mod P  c2?(m2+A*Ar2)modP, we compute the addition  of ci and c2 ,the multiplication of ci and c2 as follows:  CI *c2 =(111., *n;. +A*(41 *111., +42 *n;. +A* 41 * 42))mxlP  Decrypt( CI * c2) = ml * m2  So, this scheme is satisfied with add homomorphic and multiply homomorphic.

TTT. MAPREDUCE  MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets.

It includes two modules: Map and Reduce [4].

Map takes an input pair and produces a set of intermediate key/value pairs.

Reduce takes the intermediate data which is output by Map as input and merge the same key. At last output the result.

The Execution overview of MapReduce is as figure 2. The master assigned work of Map and Reduce to workers, the worker who is assigned a map task reads the contents of source files. And then output the key/value pairs, at this time, the worker which is assigned a reduce task will merge the key/value pairs. The output of the Reduce function is appended to a fmal output file.

IV. USING HOMOMORPHIC ENCRYPTION TN MAPREDUCE  In order to use homomorphic encryption scheme above in MapReduce, we should do some change. First of all, we can see that the function of Reduce is to find the same keys.

And then merge them, but as we all known that the keys are encrypted, and we can't find the same key just from the ciphertexts. So, we do the change as follows:  Given ciphertext C ? (m + A * Ar) mod P , we get  C * from the expression C  * = C * B * R (R is a random positive integer). And then we can campare c  * instead ofc,  to find the same key.

Proof:  Given two ciphertexts ci ? (ml + A * Ar,)modP and  c2 ? (m2 + A * Ar2) mod P  And C *  = C * B * R c * = C * B * R I I '2 2 .: A* B= P :. c2* -C  * I = ((c2 -cl)* B* R)modP  = (((ml -m2) + A * (Ar' -Ar2)) * B * R)modP  = (ml -m2)* B* RmodP .: P is very large  :. If cl* = c2*, ml = m2 otherwise ml *- m2.

Proof end!

So, before we do the Reduce function, we can add a  module, called transformation module, which can convert C  to C * . The new framework of MapReduce is as follows:  Figure 3 To test our framework using c++, we do as follows:  First, we encrypt a plaintext at client, and then deliver the ciphertext to sever, the sever map the ciphertext into many key/value pairs, and deliver the output of Map function to Reduce function. The Reduce function merges the key/value pairs, and output, the client decrypt at client at last.

The encryption /decryption module at client like this:  _ Encryption e; :. vector '.= j', ,:; - c ? . c=e.encrypt(m);  Figure 4 From the encryption method, we can see the time of  encryption will mainly depand on the multiplication, as well as the length of A and B. We test the times of encryption when using different keys, the performance of them are as follows:  TABLE 1 Key Jength(A/B) Encryption(ms) Decryption( ms) 16/16 1.55 1.61 32/32 4.65 4.33 128/128 12.45 10.32  Next, the transform module In MapReduce IS hke thIs:  Figure 5   We transform the ciphertexts to other intermediate numbers and find out the same key using these numbers. The whole test result of new framework of MapReduce is like this:  Key value 8 1  Key value 36587 1  r Key value 36587 1 22345 1  Key value f"?"" 154883   II  Key value 198675 1  l U " 111341  Key value Key value 99684 1 r"""" 198675 1 22341 1 91341 1 11145 1 198675 1  Figure 6  From the result,we can see that if the keys of source files are the same one , the ciphertexts of them usually not equal, but the results of transform module are equal, so we can also find the same key correctly.



V. CONCLUDE AND FUTURE WORK  Tn this paper, we propose a method to use homomorphic encryption in MapReduce, which first transform the intermediate data to another one, and then find the same key.

Our future work include: firstly, this method can only find the same key but can't find out the bigger one of two words. We will do some research on how to sort the words in the near future. And then we will try to enhance the efficiency of homomorphic encryption .
