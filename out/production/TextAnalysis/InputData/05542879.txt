Application Research of Association Analysis with

Abstract?After introduce briefly about the basic concept and methods of association rules in data mining, we take borrowing records in library as example to describe the whole process of how to find association with the application of Apriori algorithm in Clementine.The mining outcome shows that some books and books have stronger association strength. According to the association between books, we can do book recommendation.

That is to say, when reader borrows a book, the library can recommend the book which has strong association strength with it to the reader; we can rearrange the distribution of books in library by putting books with strong association strength close to each other to save time for readers in choosing books.

I.  INTRODUCTION The association rules in data mining attach importance to  the association among different areas of data and finding out the dependant relation among different areas in given conditions. The prospect of application of association rules is extremely bright. Retail trade analysts use association rule to analyze a great amount of sales figures. They find out customer purchasing pattern and trend to improve their service quality.

Association rules are also widely applied in risk analysis in insurance industry, market predicting in financial investment, and relevant areas about telecommunication industry.

Nowadays, the prevalent mining tools in the market are Enterprise Miner developed by SAS, Intelligent Miner developed by IBM and Clementine developed by SPSS. This paper takes Clementine12.0 as example to introduce the application of data mining.



II. ASSOCIATION RULES MINING THEORY AND ALGORITHM STUDY  Association rule is the most active research method in data mining. It was firstly put forward in 1993 by Agrawal, etc. The original motivation of putting forward it aimed at market basket analysis and the goal is to find out the association rules among different merchandise in trading database. These rules describe consumer buying behavior model and they can be  used to instruct merchant to arrange scientifically about purchases, inventory and designing of goods shelf, etc.

A. The Definition of Association Rules and Associative Processes Association Rules refer to rules that describe the potential  association among data items (attribute, variable). Using data mining techniques of Association Rules?we can find out a large amount of unknown dependant relations among data.

We define Association Rules as follows: Let I={i1, i2, ?, im}be the set of all items in a market basket data and T={t1, t2, ?, tn} be the set of all transactions. Each transaction ti contains a subset of itemset. If an itemset contains k items, it is called a k-itemset. A transaction tj is said to contain an itemset X if X is a subset of tj. An association rule is an implication expression of the form X=>Y, where X and Y are disjoint itemsets, and X?Y =?. The Strength of an association rule can be measured in terms of its support and confidence. The formal definitions of these metrics are:  ? ? NYXSupport ?? ?  (1)  ? ? ? ?XYXConfidence ?? ?? (2)  We assume that minsup is the minimum support and minconf is the minimum confidence. If the rule satisfies both minsup and minconf, it is the strong association rule.

Mining for Association Rules has two steps. The first step is to find out the group of the frequent itemset According to the definition, the frequency of appearance of these itemsets is at least the same with the number of the pre-defined minsup.

The second step is to generate the strong association rules from the frequent itemset. According to the definition, these rules must satisfy both minsup and minconf.

B. The Ccategory  of Association Rules According to the type of the attribute value in dealing with  the rule, Association Rules can be divided into Boolean association rule and Quantitative association rule.

Identify applicable sponsor/s here. (sponsors)     Boolean association rule concerns the association about whether the classification attribute value exists or not. For example, we get a rule by market basket analysis:  buys("beer")=>buys("Diapers") [sup=20%,conf=60%].

The classical algorithm, Apriori algorithm, is the most influential algorithm in mining for frequent itemset of Boolean association rule. The main idea is using the method of layer- by-layer search to find out the frequently appeared itemsets in database. The main processes of the algorithm are as follows: The first step is to generate frequent itemset L1, then scan the database D, each database appearing in D forms an candidate itemset C1, and count the frequency of each data item's appearance, the set in which the frequency is bigger than the minsup is the frequent itemset L1; the step k is to generate the frequent itemset Lk, using the frequent itemset generated by the previous step associated with itself to generate the candidate itemset Ck, then scan the database transaction set, count the frequency of each member of Ck, delete the candidate item which is smaller than the minsup, then the frequent itemset k comes out at last.

Quantitative association rule describes the association among the quantitative attributes. For example:  age(30,35)=>income(12k,14k)[sup=20%,conf=60%].

Quantitative association rule separates the quantitative attributes according to the data distribution and then use the classical algorithm to mine. E.g., income attribute is divided into equal districts as "0k...20k", "21k...30k", "31k...40k", etc.

Then substitute the value of the original attribute, stock it in the relation table. Then revise Apriori algorithm to find out all frequent predicate (i.e. to search all the relevant attributes, not only one attribute as "buys"). At last, generate the association rule which satisfies both minsup and minconf.

C. Brief Introduction of Clementine Association There is much of software of data mining, the paper focuses  on the usage of Clementine association. Clementine is a platform for data mining tools developed by ISL (Integral Solutions Limited). SPSS acquired ISL in 1999. They reintegrated and developed the production of Clementine.

Clementine is widely used special software in data mining at present, and it integrates different kinds of data mining techniques as cluster, decision tree, neural network and association rules, etc to a intuitional visible graphical interface.

The association module is very useful in protecting different outcomes. As for the association which can be found out by manual movement, Association rule algorithm can find it automatically through visible technique (e.g., the Web node).

The advantage of Association rule algorithm over decision tree algorithm is that it can find out the association among all the  attributes. Decision trees algorithm only use mono-conclusion to construct rules while Association rule algorithm tries to find out more rules and each rule has different conclusion.

Clementine offers 3 kinds of Association rule algorithms: Apriori, GRI and CARMA algorithm. We study the Apriori algorithm.



III. THE APPLICATION OF CLEMENTINE ASSOCIATION MINING  College library generates a large amount of books currency data. These data record reader's personal information and are used to do the regular service data statistics. The potential value of using these data has not been mined and used reasonably. Using cluster technique of data mining to mine for the relevant data in library, through designing and testing CADD cluster algorithm, we make a cluster application of library data and get a good outcome. The problem of whether the Association rule mining method can be applied to the analysis of books currency data to mine and discover the implied rules in the borrow behavior of readers to instruct the work of the library deserves study.

We study the data of the library borrowing system, using Clementine to mine for the association among books to offer service for recommendation and library shelf arrangement.

Readers have similarity in borrowing books, i.e., they borrow another book soon after borrowing one book. For example, after borrowing Advanced Mathematics, we usually will borrow Exercises on Advanced Mathematics.

A. Data Preparation We use borrowing data (2006.9-2008.9) of library system  to mine for association of books. Our college library uses General Library Integrated System (GLIS8.0) at present, which is an application system for library network.

At first, we study the particular borrowing details and select the top 50 books according to the number of borrowing times to do experiment about association. The statistics attributes include: control number (book's MAC), title, author, publishing house, publishing data and borrowing times. We check the particular borrowing details by looking for the bar code according to the control number. In the experiment, we select 15 books as analyzing objects. These books are <<Mechanical Parts Design Manual>>, <<Cherry tree>>, << Peking University Students Mei-wen>>, <<Spicy Lovers Amber tears>>, <<Legal Report: China's legal Lunch >>, << Even Ling >>, <<Elapsed beauty>>and <<The story of Zhou Enlai>>, etc. The relevant information about these books is showed as TABLE I.

TABLE I. THE TOP 15 BOOKS    According to the analysis of the borrowing records, 488 readers have borrowed these books. Then we refer to the borrowing records of these readers, deleting each reader's repetition borrowing record of each book, and then we get a Transaction database for discovering association rules as TABLE II. ID refers to the number of transactions; the actual data refer to the reader's certificate number; ITEM refers to the itemset of transaction and its actual meaning is the set of the reader's borrowing books. The combining meaning of the letters and numbers is call number of books.

TABLE II. TRANSACTION DATABASE  ID ITEM  0610127114 O13-44/2,O13/43,Z228/8,I247.5/38,TP312C/146,?  0710100331 78.213/5090,TH13-39/6  2003041212 TP312C/73,78.213/5090,I247.57/88,I545.73/2,?  2003041235A K827=52/8,H316/5,I207.411-53/1,C913.2/22,?  2003041540 TB301-43/2,TB301/19,71.221/1249,TB301/16,?  2003041644 TG506/3,78.29/1111,X734.201/3,X756.03/1,?      B. The Processes of Clementine Data Mining 1) Creating the data stream  The data mining processes are described by stream in Clementine. Stream is a set of Nodes and it represents the processes of data moving from Source Node to Processing Node and then to the Output Node. User can edit the stream in  steam editor. To create stream as follows: select ?File? from "Menu", then click "New Stream".

2) Adding and editing the data source node Editing stream in stream editor, we firstly should add data  source node and then attach it to the data for mining. In Clementine, Database, Fixed File, SPSS File, SAS File, Excel, User Input are data source nodes. Data used in this paper are stored in Excel. Therefore, we select Sources tab, double click Excel node in node module, adding Excel node to stream editor window. Then we edit it in editor window and select the data file we need.

3) Importing Data Double click Type node, click Read value in a pop-up  dialog box to import data.

4) Adding data mining model node Clementine offers algorithm models as nerve network,  decision tree, cluster, sequence, regression, association, etc. As this thesis describing the application processes of association, we should construct association data mining model.

Clementine offers association models as GRI, Apriori, Carma, Sequence, etc. This thesis uses the Apriori model so we add stream by selecting Apriori in model tab.

5) Executing the mining model After model setup, we set the pre-piece and the post-piece,  and click "Execute". After execution, a new icon will appear in manager. We can see the execution outcome by right clicking the icon and clicking "Browse".

6) Making mining outcome visible If you want to make the final mining outcome visible, you  can add a certain graphic node to data stream and execute it.

An integrated data stream is showed as Fig. 1.

Figure 1. Data Stream    C. The Description of Data MiningRresult We can get different mining outcomes by selecting  different minsup and minconf as is showed in TABLE III.

ASSOCIATION RESULT  Result Minsup(%) Minconf(%) Rules  Result 1 4 50 48  Result 2 5 50 16  Result 3 6 55 4    In TABLE III, there are 48 association rules in the first outcome where minsup is 4% and minconf is 50%; there are 16 association rules in the second outcome where minsup is 5% and minconf is 50%; there are 4 association rules in the third outcome where minsup is 6% and minconf is 55%. Then let's see the differences among mining outcomes when minsup and minconf have different values.

In the first outcome, there are 48 association rules where minsup is 4% and minconf is 50%. Among these 48 rules, the minsup is 4.098%; the maxsup is 7.992%; the minconf is 50%; the maxconf is 84.615%. Some Association rules strength among books are showed in Fig. 2.

Figure 2. Association Rules Strength Among Books I    In Fig. 2, the thicker the line between the two books is, the stronger the association strength of the two books is. The thinner the line is, the weaker the association strength is. Link refers to the number of times of the appearance of the pre-piece and the post-piece at the same time. As is showed in Fig. 2, there are 28 links between 1247.56/9 and 1247.56/6, i.e. 28 readers borrow the two books at the same time. We define it as a strong link when there are more than 30 links between 2 books; a medium link when the number is between 15 and 30; a weak link when the number is under 15. The Fig. 2 is an outcome after deleting some weak link. The aim is to see clearly that which 2 books have stronger association strength, i.e., after borrowing one book, the reader tends to borrow another book.

We change the graph to data showed in TABLE IV. As is showed in TABLE IV, when readers borrow I247.56/6 (<<Ghost Inn>>), I247.7/13(<<Peak Reasoning>>), I247.57/ 118(<<Latent grass Rapids>>), I712.45/2(<<Honey-moon Cry>>), I516.84/2(<<Laura?s Secret>>), I247.56/8(<< Sad death>>), I247.57/119(<<Find Murderer>>), I247.57/ 114(<<Elapsed Beauty>>) and I247.55/6(<<Adventures in urban demon>>), they often borrow I247.56/9(<<Even Ling>>); when readers borrows I247.55/5(<<FLS Legend (Part One)>>), they usually also borrow  I247.56/4(<<Love War KGB>>); when readers borrows I247.57/105(<< Sparrow Revolute>>), they usually also borrow I247.57/78 (<<Spicy Lovers Amber tears>>); when readers borrow I247.55/1(<<Soul Wars>>), they often also borrow I247.55/6 (<<Adventures in urban demon>>).

There are 16 association rules in the second outcome where minsup is 5% and minconf is 50%. Compared with the first outcome, it has deleted the rules with sup under 5%. Among these 16 rules, minsup is 5.123%, maxsup is 7.992%, minconf is 50%, maxconf is 84.615%. The association strength is showed in Fig. 3.

The association strength is showed in detail in Fig. 4. As is showed in Figure IV, I247.56/9 and I247.7/13 have the strongest association strength, I247.56/9 and I247.45/29 come second, and then I247.57/78 and I247.57/78, I247.56/  and I247.55/6  at last.

IV. CONCLUSOION The paper starts with the basic concept of Association rules,  describing the whole processes of how to find association rules by using Clementine through the study of borrowing records about the books association. The mining outcome shows that, <<Even Ling>> and <<Peak Reasoning>>, << Even Ling >>and <<Honeymoon Cry>>, <<Sky Blue>> and <<Spicy Lovers Amber tears>>, << Even Ling >> and <<Adventures in urban demon>> have stronger association strength. According to the association between books, we can do book recommendation. That is to say, when reader borrows a book, the library can recommend the book which has strong association strength with it to the reader; we can rearrange the distribution of books in library by putting books with strong association strength close to each other to save time for readers in choosing books.

Clementine has other association algorithms. As for the length of the paper, we only study the Apriori algorithm. We can use different algorithms of Clementine in a broader area.
