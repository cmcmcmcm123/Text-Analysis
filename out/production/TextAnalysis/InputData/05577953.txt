Transitive Association Rule Discovery by Considering Strategic Importance

Abstract The TSAA(transitive support association Apriori) algorithm of this paper discovers transitively associated relationships as well as the frequent itemsets. It utilizes the join item set to find the transitive association rules. Since the join item of a transitive association which have low support value tends to be removed from the next candidate itemset generation, we used two kinds of support values, ?minimum support? and ?minimum relative support,? in finding the transitive relations. This way the items carrying a strategic importance are given a second chance so that they might be used in discovering the transitive association rules. Our experiments with a real world database showed that the TSAA algorithm was useful in producing transitive itemsets which could not have been obtained otherwise. Observation from other transaction database indicated that there is a ?minimum relative support level? at which the number of transitive association itemset decreases suddenly.

I.  INTRODUCTION Association rule mining is widely used to find interesting relationships among the items of a market basket. Apriori algorithm is generally used to find Boolean associations [1] [7]. RSAA(relative support association Apriori) is a modification to find the association rules among the infrequent data items [5]. Both Apriori and RSAA algorithms make a brute force search of the association rules to test if they meet the condition for ?minimum support? or ?minimum relative support?.

Oftentimes the important semantic relationships among the market basket items are ignored since the associations with low support have to be dropped out from further considerations by most algorithms. For example, Apriori discovers frequent itemsets solely by counting the frequency of occurrence of the items in the database. There is no semantics associated with it. RSAA tries to find association rules with relatively low support [5]. Both algorithms assume that each item has equal importance in its value.

However, in the real world, certain items are more valuable than others even though they show up less frequently in the market basket. For example, the sale of a TV set returns much greater profit than a toaster oven. In this regard, a new data mining technique would be useful to  find the association rules that reflect the semantic aspects or strategic importance. This paper presents a new algorithm that takes into account the semantic aspects of the association. Specifically, this paper considers the transitive association rule as a special case of semantic relation.

This paper is comprised of four sections. The next section reviews the basic concepts of association rule mining and discusses recent improvements and variations of the Apriori method. Section three discusses the main idea of transitive association rule mining technique. TSAA algorithm is presented and its sample usage together with a large scale field data application is provided. The last section discusses some findings, issues for further research, and recent progresses about reflecting strategic aspects into the association rule mining technique.



II. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING AND ITS VARIATIONS  A. Association rule Basic definition about association rule is briefly summarized here for refreshments of the readers? memory. Let ?= {i1, i2, ?, im} be a set of items and D a database of transactions where each transaction T is a set of items such that T??. An association rule is an implication of the form A?B, where A??, B??, and A?B=?. The rule A ? B holds in the transaction set D with support s, where s is the percentage of transaction in D that contains both A and B. The rule A?B has confidence c in the transaction set D if c is the percentage of transaction in D which contains A and it also contains B.

s = Support(A?B) = P(A?B) c = Confidence(A?B) = P(B|A)   B. Algorithms for association rule mining Association rules can be classified into many types such as Boolean, quantitative, single vs. multi-dimensional, and single-level vs. multi-level association rules, etc. [2,3,7].

?Market basket analysis? belongs in the Boolean association rule category and Apriori is a typical algorithm of market basket analysis. Many variations to the Apriori algorithm have been attempted to improve the algorithm performance.

They include AprioriTid, MSApriori (Multiple Support Apriori), MaxOccur (Maximum Occurrence), and RSAA  DOI 10.1109/CIT.2010.292    DOI 10.1109/CIT.2010.292    DOI 10.1109/CIT.2010.292     (Relative Support Apriori algorithm) [2,4,7]. However, they differ only in minor features such as different ordering of the data elements, or placing more importance on scarce data items, etc.

Recent studies on association rule mining address various topics such as multiple support values, recurrent cyclic association rule, spatial association rule, time limited sequential association rule, and intermittent and simultaneous sequential pattern [10,12]. Surveys on these researches indicate that no transitive association rule has been addressed nor explored so far.

1) Apriori Since the Apriori algorithm [7] is the very foundational work of association rule mining, we assume the readers are friendly with the algorithm.

2) AprioriTid AprioriTid uses Apriori-gen function to generate the candidate itemsets. It differs from Apriori in that it does not need to rescan the database to calculate the support level of the candidate itemsets. It scans the database only once to determine the 1-frequent itemsets and then uses only those frequent itemsets to generate the next stage candidate itemsets [12].

3) MSApriori Some items occur more often than others in the transaction database. MSApriori(Multiple Support Apriori) is an improved version of Apriori which considers the frequency of occurrence of individual item. In fact, this algorithm assigns ?minimum item support (MIS)? level to each item in order to take into account the frequency of occurrence of the individual item [8, 9].

4) MaxOccur (Maximum Occurrence) Earlier association rule mining algorithms did not consider recurrence issue. MaxOccur defines the association rules that consider the recurrent items when generating the k- candidate itemsets. The algorithm begins with finding the 1- frequent itemsets. It then examines the frequency of recurrent items in the frequent itemset. The process continues to generate k-itemsets until it finds the predefined ?Maximum Occurrence? item. The infrequent items that fail to meet the support level are removed from further processing [12].

5) RSAA (Relative Support Apriori) RSAA considers the relative frequency of occurrence [5,6,12] and uses two support values in the mining process.

The first one (min_sup_1) is the user defined ?minimum support? which is used to find the frequent itemsets. The items that do not meet this value are grouped into infrequent itemset. The second value is the ?relative support (min_sup_2)? which is used to evaluate the infrequent itemset and to see if they meet the relative support.

?Min_sup_1? must be greater than ?min_sup_2.? RSAA can also be applied to where there is a hierarchical relationship among the data items

III. TRANSITIVE ASSOCIATION RULE DISCOVERY  A. Transitively associated relationship Suppose the Apriori algorithm produced the following 2- candidate itemsets ?{milk, bread}, {bread, toaster}, and {milk, toaster}? with the respective support values 50%, 40%, 30%. If we use 40% as the min_support, we get two ?2-frequent itemsets? out of the three ?2-candidate itemsets,? i.e., {milk, bread} and {bread, toaster}. Here we note that the two association rules {milk, bread} and {bread, toaster} combined together produce the transitive relation <milk?toaster>. A high support is required for the transitive relation to hold. However, in this case, the support is only 30%, and so the {milk, toaster} itemset must be removed from further processing.

This paper is tuned to the development of an algorithm that retains the transitively associated itemsets as well as the normal frequent itemsets. The purpose is to discover useful, and sometimes strategically important, patterns forsaken by the Apriori procedure and to utilize the recovered transitive associations as a useful knowledge for real world applications. As shown in the famous ?beer and diaper? episode of association rule mining [11], we sometimes encounter difficulty in interpreting the semantics of the mining results. However, if we retain the transitive association rules, it may help us to find the missing links of an association. For example, the following two itemsets {beer, milk} and {milk, diaper} may render a reasonable interpretation of the association between ?beer and diaper.?  Most of the association rule mining algorithms do not retain the semantically meaningful rules because they usually use the simple ?support and confidence? criteria. The ?milk?bread?toaster? relation is a typical example which contains semantically meaningful transitive relationship but the {milk, toaster} itemset has to be removed from the frequent itemset. If we keep the transitively associated itemsets as the legitimate course of the association rule mining, we will be able to find out the items which have strategic importance in marketing and sales analysis.

B. The TSAA algorithm The ?TSAA (transitive support association Apriori)? algorithm of this paper utilizes the combination of Apriori and RSAA algorithms. It uses two minimum support values min_support (minimum support) and minRsup (minimum relative support). The algorithm begins with the same Apriori procedure in finding the 1-frequent itemsets. In the next step, we generate the 2-candidate itemsets and compare the support values against the min_support. If the itemset has a support value greater than the min_support, it is grouped into the frequent itemset. If not, it is stored in the infrequent itemsets, and we examine whether there is a transitive relationship. If there are two or more itemsets that lead to a transitive relation, they form the transitive itemsets (TRD).

In the next step, TSAA calculates the ?relative support (Rsup)? to find any ?transitively associated itemsets.? The notations and definitions about the TSAA algorithm are as follows.

Ck = k-candidate transitive itemsets = { Ck1, Ck2, ?, Cki,  ?, Ckm }, Ckj : jth k-candidate transitive itemset Rsupj : relative support value of the jth transitive  itemset TRDsup(Ckj) : the support value of the jth k-candidate  transitive itemset minRsup: Minimum Relative Support (user defined) Ck = { ?1, ?2, ?, ?k } where ?i indicates an item Rsupj = max{ TRDsup(Ckj)/sup(?1), TRDsup(Ckj)/sup(?2), ..., TRDsup(Ckj)/sup(?3), ..., TRDsup(Ckj)/sup(?k) }   If Rsupj  is greater than minRsup, Ckj: is grouped into the  k-transitive itemset TRDk. Suppose we have a transaction database as shown in Table 1. We apply the TSAA algorithm and calculate Rsupj for each of the candidate transitive itemset.

If minRsup=0.4, we obtain the transitive association itemsets TRD2= {{perfume, swimwear}, {swimwear, insurance}, {swimwear, suitcase}, {insurance, suitcase}, {insurance, sunglass}}, and in the next step we obtain 3-frequent itemset {{swimwear, sunglass, suncream}, {swimwear, suitcase, sunglass}, {suitcase, sunglass, suncream}} and 3-transitive itemset {{perfume, swimwear, insurance}, {suitcase, perfume, swimwear}, {sunglass, swimwear, insurance}, {suitcase, sunglass, insurance}}. Detailed procedures for computing Rsupj are discussed in the TSAA algorithm to appear later in this section.

Remark 2. Apply the Apriori-gen procedure [7] on frequent itemset Lk-1 and generate k-candidate itemset Ck.  Join operation is performed in this process and element size is increased by one.

Ck = { Ck1, Ck2, ?, Cki, ?, Ckm }, and m represents the cardinality of itemsets that satisfy the minimum support value.

For example, C2 = { C21, C22, C23 } = {{2,3}, {2,4}, {2,6}}  Ck = { ?1, ?2, ?, ?k }  // k-itemset is composed of k items // And if k=2,  C21 = { ?1, ?2 } = {2, 3}  ?   ?1 = 2,  ?2 = 3 C22 = { ?1, ?2 } = {2, 4}  ?   ?1 = 2,  ?2 = 4   Remark 3. Perform join operation on ?k-candidate transitive itemset? (k?2), and generate ?(k+1)-transitive association itemset (TLk).? Remark 4. Since the ?(k+1)-transitive association itemsets are generated from the join operation of the k-itemsets, (k?2), which meet the minRsup condition, checking for minRsup condition is redundant and unnecessary.

Remark 5. Count the number of transaction records that contain the ?k-candidate itemset.? Remark 6. Calculate the support value for each of the ?k- candidate itemset,? and if each itemset meets the minimum support, it is added to the ?k-frequent itemset (Lk).? Remark 7. k-itemsets that do not meet the minimum support are reviewed for transitive association. If they hold, they are added to the ?k-candidate transitive itemset (TCk).? Remark 8. Calculate the ?relative support? for each of the itemset in TCk.

Remark 9. Collect only those itemsets in TCk that meet the user defined ?minimum relative support,? and form TRDk.

C. Experiment with a field data In order to evaluate and verify the functionality of the TSAA algorithm, we collected a total of 730 customer receipts from a local shopping center (E- mart: a large scale  discount store in Korea). A data cleaning and transformation was performed in the data preparation stage. Table 3 shows the list of items described in terms of their categories.

Table 3.  List of items (categories)  Item ID Item Description  1 Baby food 2 Bread 3 Cooked meal 4 Noodle 5 Frozen food 6 Milk & beverage 7 Coffee & tea 8 Confectionery 9 Canned food  10 Ham & fish cake 11 Sauce 12 Liquor 13 Stock farm product 14 Fish 15 Vegetable 16 Dried fish 17 Gimchie 18 Egg 19 Rice cake 20 Fruit     Figure 3.  Input data screen   ?Fig. 3? is a screen capture of the input data represented in Excel spreadsheet. Each row of the table indicates the transaction data of a customer. If customer i purchased item j, then the cell (i, j) is marked 1, otherwise 0. The TSAA algorithm was implemented using the programming feature of Microsoft Excel. Considering the support level of 1- frequent itemsets we used 20% for ?minimum support? and 50% for ?minimum relative support? in our experiment.

Table 4 shows the result of TSAA algorithm application. It produced the k-frequent itemsets for k=1..4 exactly the same way that we would obtain from the Apriori algorithm. In addition, we obtained 11 ?3-transitive itemsets? as are shown at the bottom of Table 4.

Observation of the 3-transitive itemsets {2, 6, 10}, {2, 6, 11}, {2, 6, 12}, {2, 6, 18} in Table 4 reveals the new knowledge that item 6 (Milk & beverage) plays the linkage role between item 2 (Bread) and other items such as 10, 11, 12, and 18 which represent ?Ham & fish cake,? ?Sauce,? ?Liquor,? and ?Egg? respectively. This knowledge may     provide us with some insight concerning the marketing strategy and shop floor layout design. Looking at the ?3- frequent itemsets? in Table 4, we notice that items 6, 8, and 15 are transitive items. However, the list of ?3-transitive itemset? indicate that items 6, 10, 11, and 12 are also transitive items. So we notice that items 10, 11, and 12 could have been removed from transitivity consideration in case we used the Apriori algorithm only.

Table 4.  Result of the TSAA algorithm        Figure 4.  Number of transitive association itemsets at various levels of minimum relative support   ?Fig. 4? shows the behavior of TSAA algorithm as we  changed the level of minimum relative support.  This figure is obtained from other set of experiment data. However, it indicates that, depending on the transaction database D, there is a minimum relative support level at which the number of transitive association items begins to drop sharply.

Another observation from this study is that when the size of transitive association itemset gets larger than 3, there comes the chance to have multiple join items. That is, two or more join items can appear in the higher-degree transitive association itemset. Although it suffices to have transitive associations among three items, further development of the algorithm would be necessary to derive a useful knowledge concerning multi-linkage transitive associations.



IV. CONCLUSION Transitive association rule mining is a novel approach to market basket analysis. It addresses the strategic issue that mining task is geared to the semantic relationship mining.

It is possible to modify the TSAA algorithm such that we may use different level of minimum support as the size of the itemset(k) gets larger. As the itemset size gets larger, it will become harder to find itemsets that meet the minimum support level. Relaxing the minimum support level to a lower value might be a viable option to increase the possibility of getting more meaningful transitive association rules. Other modification of the algorithm, e.g., combination with MIS or Maxoccur is a likely possibility.

The TSAA algorithm for transitive association mining can be applied to marketing campaigns, sales promotion, customer relationship management, and in many other areas.

The join (linkage) items in the transitively associated itemsets carry special meaning depending on the situation.

With a simple Excel programming of the TSAA algorithm we were able to obtain the transitive itemsets as well as the frequent itemsets. In this paper, the TSAA algorithm focused mainly on finding transitive association itemsets from the transaction database and a single user- defined minimum relative support value was used.
