Tell me all the B734?s arriving SFO on July 11, 2007 from 4 pm to 7pm  Tell me all the air traffic in this geographic area on this day  Tell me all the aircraft leaving IAD enroute to LAX in the month of March 2008  Many more  Air Traffic Analysis  Given descriptive pattern discovered using historical data, compute distinct air traffic within an air space volume of interest (over LAS) on Nov 6, 2013 between 10:15 and 10:30 PM    Copyright ? 2009 Boeing.

Boeing AATM has been receiving live Aircraft Situation Display to Industry (ASDI) data and archiving it for three years  There is not an easy mechanism to perform basic analysis. The incoming data is large, compressed, and requires correlation with other flight data before it can be analyzed  Boeing is implementing a service that records, retrieves, analyzes and visualizes aviation big data  ?Prototype work in progress  Problem Statement    Copyright ? 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.

Provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to deliver flight plan and track information from the NAS to aviation industry in real-time and near real-time  Product of the Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS)  A stream of data packets containing Zlib compressed XML documents with a binary header  Can be flight plan related, oceanic, or host tracks reports  ASDI    Copyright ? 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.

ASDI Message Counts for August 8,  Supporting Record Counts for August 8,  Typical ASDI Data    Copyright ? 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.

Each ASDI message does not always provide enough information to identify the flight it is associated with.

Centers operate independently of each other to assign their own Computer Identification (CID) code to flight plans. So, using CID alone is not sufficient.

Correlator generates a new unique FLIGHT_KEY as it identifies a new unique flight plan.

FLIGHT_KEY is comprised of aircraft id, flight status, departure center, air craft type, destination, etc.

IBM WebSphere Message Broker and MQ for near real- time ASDI feed consumption, message routing and transformation  ? SPSS Modeler for predictive analytics  ?

Database Modeling  Schemas for correlated ASDI messages translated into equivalent relational schemas  ? Database tables generated based on classes created from schema definitions  ? Nine main, eleven supporting tables  ? Each main table contains FLIGHT_KEY    Copyright ? 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.

Database Modeling    Copyright ? 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.

Correlation Process  To archive received ASDI data ?Track messages must be correlated with flight plan messages  FLIGHT_KEY assigned  Uncorrelated data tagged  Approx 30 minutes to correlate one day of data    Copyright ? 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.

Historical Data Processing  To load correlated data ?Uncompress, unmarshall  ?Create a list of files containing the correlated data  ?Write data to warehouse    Copyright ? 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.

Live Data Processing  Processed using IBM MQ, IBM Message Broker and a technique called XML Shredding  Message Broker Compute Nodes  ? Uncompress Node  ? Extract correlated messages  ? Shred Node adds to DB  Stored Procedure ?shreds? XML docs and adds to tables    Copyright ? 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.

Issues and Observations  Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours  Optimizations ? Write data in batches  ? Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  ? Deploy a higher performance machine  ? Use load instead of insert  ? Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables  ? Database tunings  Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes    Copyright ? 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.

Optimizations  Use a mutable data structure to create data strings ? Original application created the SQL statement by appending elements to a Java String  ? It was taking five hours (of the seven hours) to create Strings  ? Instead Java StringBuilder used  ? Java Strings immutable  ? Time savings of 71.4%    Copyright ? 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.

Optimizations  Deployed on a higher-performance machine ? Application ported  from IBM Blade Center HS21 (4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon 5130 processor)  to Dell M4500 computer (4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core Intel Core i7 processor)  ? Reduced the time to thirty minutes  Bulk loading instead of insert ? Application was modified to write CSV files for each table  ? Entire day worth of data bulk loaded  ? Reduced the time to fifteen minutes    Copyright ? 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.

Optimizations  Range-Partitioned tables (RPT) used ? To limit the size of tables, the original code created multiple tables per table type  ? This puts burden on the application to query multiple tables when a range crosses several tables  ? With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries when a range crosses a table boundary  ? Increased the time to thirty minutes  ? Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning enabled time savings during queries    Copyright ? 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.

Optimizations  Database tunings ? Range periods changed from a week to a month  ? Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 512KB  ? Buffer pool size decreased  ? Decreased the time to twenty minutes  Overall, total time savings of 95.2%    Copyright ? 2009 Boeing.
