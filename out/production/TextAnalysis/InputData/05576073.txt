Association Action Rules and Action Paths Triggered by Meta-Actions

Abstract?Action rules are built from atomic expressions called atomic action terms and they describe possible transi- tions of objects from one state to another. They involve changes of values within one decision attribute. Association action rule is similar to an action rule but it may refer to changes of values involving several attributes listed in its decision part. Action paths are defined as sequences of association action rules with the assumption that the last rule in a sequence is as action rule.

Early research on action rule discovery usually required the extraction of classification rules before constructing any action rule. Newest algorithms discover action rules and association action rules directly from an information system. This paper presents a strategy for generating association action rules and action paths by incorporating the use of meta-actions and influence matrices. Action paths show the cascading effect of meta-actions leading to a desired goal.

I. INTRODUCTION  An association action rule is a rule extracted from an information system that describes a cascading effect of changes of attribute values listed on the left-hand side of a rule [10] on changes of attribute values listed on its right-hand side. Similarly to [10], [11], we assume that attributes used to describe objects are partitioned into stable and flexible. Values of flexible attributes can be changed whereas values of stable attributes have to remain the same.

Action rules mining initially required to compare profiles of two groups of targeted objects - those that are desirable and those that are undesirable [11]. An action rule was defined as a term [(?) ? (? ? ?)] ? (? ? ?), where ? is a conjunction of fixed condition features shared by both groups, (? ? ?) represents proposed changes in values of flexible features, and (? ? ?) is a desired effect of the action. To be more precise, it states that ?when the circumstances are ?, changing alpha to beta will cause phi to change to psi?.

In most cases it is not possible to change the values of flexible attributes without having them triggered by some higher-level actions. For instance, we can not lower the temperature of a patient if he does not take a drug used for that purpose. Taking aspirin is an example of a higher-level action which is expected to trigger such a change. In this  paper, such higher-level actions are called meta-actions. The associations between meta-actions and changes of attribute values they trigger can be modeled using either an influence matrix [15] or ontology [3].

Action rules have been introduced in [11] and investigated further in [13], [14], [4], [8]. Paper [6] was probably the first attempt towards formally introducing the problem of mining action rules without pre-existing classification rules.

Authors explicitly formulated it as a search problem in a support-confidence-cost framework. The proposed algorithm is similar to Apriori [1]. Their definition of an action rule allows changes within stable attributes. Clearly, changing the value of an attribute is naturally linked with some cost [14]. In medical area, cost may refer to how expensive is the patient care but also may refer to its safety. In [6], authors used the cost measure for entirely different purpose - to rule out action rules involving changes of stable attribute values by assigning to them very high cost. However, they did not take into account correlations between attributes which may either decrease or increase the cost of rules.

Algorithm ARD, presented in [9], is based on Pawlak?s model of an information system S [7]. The goal was to identify certain relationships between granules defined by the indiscernibility relation on its objects. Some of these relationships uniquely define action rules for S.

Paper [15] introduced the notion of action as a domain- independent way to model the domain knowledge. Given a data set about actionable features and utility measure, a pattern is actionable if it summarizes a population that can be acted upon towards a more promising population observed with a higher utility. Algorithms for mining actionable patterns (changes within flexible attributes) take into account only numerical attributes. The distinguished (decision) at- tribute is called utility. Each action Ai triggers changes of attribute values described by terms [a ?], [b ?], and [c (don?t know)]. They are represented as an influence matrix built by an expert. While previous approaches used only features - mined directly from the decision system, authors in [15] define actions as its foreign concepts. Influence matrix shows the link between actions and changes of attribute values and the same shows correlations between some attributes, i.e. if [a ?], then [b ?]. Clearly, expert does not know   DOI 10.1109/GrC.2010.64     correlations between classification attributes and the decision attribute. Such correlations can be described as action rules and they have to be discovered from the decision system.

In [12], changes of attribute values and action rules are also described using terms [a ?], [b ?].

Authors in [15] did not take into consideration stable attributes. Also, their attributes are only numerical. In this paper, for simplicity reason, we use only symbolic attributes.

Numerical attributes, if any, are discretized before associa- tion rules or action rules are discovered.



II. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES  In this section we introduce the notion of an information system, atomic action term, meta-action, and give examples.

By an information system [7] we mean a triple S = (X,A, V ), where:  1) X is a nonempty, finite set of objects 2) A is a nonempty, finite set of attributes, i.e.

a : U ?? Va is a function for any a ? A, where Va is called the domain of a  3) V = ?{Va : a ? A}.

For example, Table 1 shows an information system S with a set of objects X = {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8}, set of attributes A = {a, b, c, d}, and a set of their values V = {a1, a2, b1, b2, b3, c1, c2, d1, d2, d3}.

a b c d x1 a1 b1 c1 d1 x2 a2 b1 c2 d1 x3 a2 b2 c2 d1 x4 a2 b1 c1 d1 x5 a2 b3 c2 d1 x6 a1 b1 c2 d2 x7 a1 b2 c2 d1 x8 a1 b2 c1 d3  Table 1 : Information System S  An information system S = (X,A, V ) is called a deci- sion system, if one of the attributes in A is distinguished and called the decision. The remaining attributes in A are classification attributes. Additionally, we assume that A = ASt?AFl?{d}, where attributes in ASt are called stable and in AFl flexible. Attribute d is the decision attribute. ?Place of birth? is an example of a stable attribute. ?Marital status? is an example of an attribute which can be either stable or flexible.

By atomic action term t associated with S, we mean any expression t = (a, a1 ? a2), where a1, a2 ? Va, a ? A.

If a1 = a2, then we will also write (a, a1) instead of (a, a1 ? a2). Object x ? X satisfying the description a(x) = a1 belongs to the domain of t if there is a way of changing its attribute value a1 to a2.

By meta-actions associated with S we mean higher con- cepts used to model certain generalizations of actions intro- duced in [15]. Meta-actions, when executed, trigger changes  in values of some flexible attributes in S as described by influence matrix [15] and atomic action terms. To give an example, let us assume that classification attributes in S describe teaching evaluations at some school and the decision attribute represents their overall score. Explain dif- ficult concepts effectively, Speaks English fluently, Stimulate student interest in the course, Provide sufficient feedback are examples of classification attributes. Then, examples of meta-actions associated with S will be: Change the content of the course, Change the textbook of the course, Post all material on the Web. Clearly, any of these three meta-actions will not influence the attribute Speaks English fluently and the same its values will remain unchanged [15]. Let us take Hepatitis as the application domain. Then increase blood cell plague and decrease level of alkaline phosphatase are examples of an atomic action term. Drugs like Hepatil or Hepargen can be seen as meta-actions triggering changes described by these two atomic action terms. It should be noted that Hepatil is also used to get rid of obstruction, eructation, and bleeding. However, Hepargen is not used to get rid of obstruction but it is used to get rid of eructation and bleeding.

Also, it should be mentioned here that an expert knowl- edge related to meta-actions involves only classification attributes. Now, if some of these attributes are correlated with the decision attributes (the ones listed on the right-hand side of an association action rule), then the change of their values will cascade to the decision through the correlation.

The goal of action rule discovery is to identify possibly all such correlations.

In earlier works in [11], [13], action rules are constructed from classification rules. This means that we use pre-existing classification rules or generate them using a rule discovery algorithm, such as LERS [5] or ERID [2] (if the data have probabilistic type), then, construct action rules either from certain pairs of these rules or from a single classification rule. In [10] authors presented a strategy for extracting action rules directly from a decision system. Similarly, authors in [10] presented a strategy for discovering association action rules directly from an information system.

In the next section, we recall the notion of action terms, action rules, association rules [10], and the notion of an influence matrix (see [15]) associated with a set of meta- actions. The values stored in an influence matrix are atomic action terms. We also introduce the notion of an action path.



III. ACTION RULES, ACTION PATHS, AND META-ACTIONS  Let S = (X,A, V ) be an information system, where V =?{Va : a ? A}. First, we recall the notion of an atomic action term [9].

By an atomic action term we mean an expression (a, a1 ? a2), where a is an attribute and a1, a2 ? Va. If a1 = a2, then a is called stable on a1.

By action terms [9] we mean a smallest collection of atomic action terms such that:  1) If t is an atomic action term, then t is an action term.

2) If t1, t2 are action terms, then t1 ? t2 is a candidate  action term.

3) If t is a candidate action term and for any two atomic  action terms (a, a1 ? a2), (b, b1 ? b2) contained in t we have a 	= b, then t is an action term.

By the domain of an action term t, denoted by Dom(t), we mean the set of all attribute names listed in t. For instance, if (a, a2) ? (b, b1 ? b2) is an action term, then Dom(t) = {a, b}. Assume now that  {(a, a2), (b, b1 ? b2)}, {(a, a2), (c, c1 ? c2)} are two collections of atomic action terms. Meta-action  M1 can trigger the changes represented by (a, a2) ? (b, b1 ? b2) and M2 can trigger the changes represented by (a, a2) ? (c, c1 ? c2). It means that attribute a in both cases has to remain stable.

Consider several meta-actions, denoted M1, M2,...,Mn.

Each one can invoke changes within values of some clas- sification attributes in A. We assume here that A ? {d} = A1 ?A2 ? ... ?Am. The expected changes of classification attribute values on objects from S which are triggered by these meta-actions are described by the influence matrix {Ei,j}, 1 ? i ? n, 1 ? j ? m. Table 2 gives an example of an influence matrix associated with 6 meta-actions and attributes a, b, and c.

a b c M1 b1 c2 ? c1 M2 a2 ? a1 b2 M3 a1 ? a2 c2 ? c1 M4 b1 c1 ? c2 M5 c1 ? c2 M6 a1 ? a2 c1 ? c2  Table 2: Influence Matrix associated with S  For instance, let us take meta-action M2. It says that by executing M2 on objects in S, two atomic action terms are triggered. They are: (a2 ? a1) and (b, b2 ? b2). It means that objects in S satisfying the description (a, a2) ? (b, b2) are expected to change their description to (a, a1) ? (b, b2).

Also, it should be noticed that any influence matrix does not have to be associated with a decision system but only with an information system.

By an association action rule we mean any expression r = [t1 ? t2], where t1 and t2 are action terms. Addi- tionally, we assume that Dom(t2) ? Dom(t1) ? A and Dom(t2) ? Dom(t1) = ?. If t2 is an atomic action term, then r is an action rule. The domain of action rule r is defined as Dom(t1) ?Dom(t2).

Now, we give an example of an association action rule as- suming that the information system S is represented by Table  1, attributes a, c, d are flexible and b is stable. Expressions (a, a2), (b, b2), (c, c1 ? c2), (d, d1 ? d2) are examples of atomic action terms. Expression r = [[(a, a2) ? (c, c1 ? c2)] ? (d, d1 ? d2)] is an example of an association action rule which is also an action rule. The rule says that if value a2 for objects in S remains unchanged and the value of c will change from c1 to c2, then it is expected that value d1 for all these objects will change to d2. The domain Dom(r) of action rule r is equal to {a, c, d}.

By an action path we mean a sequence [t1 ? t2 ? ...? tn], where ti is an action term for any 1 ? i ? n ? 1, and tn is an atomic action term. Additionally, we assume that: (?i ? n ? 1)(?ti1, ti2, ti3, ti4)[[ti = ti1 ? ti2 ? ti3] ? [ti+1 = ti1 ? ti4 ? ti3] ? [(ti2 ? ti4) is an action rule extracted from S]].

For instance: [(b1, v1 ? w1) ? (b2, v2 ? w2) ? ... ? (bp, vp ? wp)] ? [(b1, v1 ? w1)? ...? [(bj1, vj1 ? wj1)? (bj2, vj2 ? wj2)? ...? (bjq, vjq ? wjq)]? ...? (bp, vp ? wp)] ? (d, k1 ? k2) is an action path if [(bj1, vj1 ? wj1) ? (bj2, vj2 ? wj2) ? ... ? (bjq, vjq ? wjq)] ? (bj , vj ? wj) is an action rule.

To justify the purpose of introducing the notion of an action path, we take as an example the medical domain.

The medical state of a patient is represented by values of attributes including results of medical tests. Action terms represent possible changes within values of some of these attributes which can be triggered by drugs, consultations with doctors or surgeries. At the same time, the description of a medical state of a patient based on these attributes may not be sufficient to identify any disease and the same what set of drugs should be prescribed to the patient. In such cases, the doctor still may decide to prescribe some drugs with a goal to move the patient to a new medical state which hopefully will be less complex in terms of stating the medical diagnosis. The purpose of introducing the notion of an action path is to model this kind of reasoning which also describes the steps of a medical treatment.

Standard interpretation NS of action terms in S = (X,A, V ) is defined as follow:  1) If (a, a1 ? a2) is an atomic action term, then NS((a, a1 ? a2)) = [{x ? X : a(x) = a1}, {x ? X : a(x) = a2}].

2) If t1 = (a, a1 ? a2) ? t and NS(t) = [Y1, Y2], then NS(t1) = [Y1 ? {x ? X : a(x) = a1}, Y2 ? {x ? X : a(x) = a2}].

Let us define [Y1, Y2] ? [Z1, Z2] as [Y1 ? Z1, Y2 ? Z2] and assume that NS(t1) = [Y1, Y2] and NS(t2) = [Z1, Z2].

Then, NS(t1 ? t2) = NS(t1) ?NS(t2).

If t is an association action rule and NS(t) = {Y1, Y2}, then the support of t in S is defined as sup(t) = min{card(Y1), card(Y2)}.

Now, let r = [t1 ? t2] is an association action rule, where NS(t1) = [Y1, Y2], NS(t2) = [Z1, Z2]. Support and confidence of r is defined as follow:     1) sup(r) = min{card(Y1 ? Z1), card(Y2 ? Z2)}.

2) conf(r) = [ card(Y1?Z1)card(Y1) ] ? [  card(Y2?Z2) card(Y2)  ].

The definition of a confidence requires that card(Y1) 	= 0  and card(Y2) 	= 0. Otherwise, the confidence of an associ- ation action rule is undefined.

Coming back to the example of S given in Table 1, we can find a number of association action rules associated with S. Let us take r = [[(b, b1) ? (c, c1 ? c2)] ? (d, d1 ? d2)] as an example of association action rule. Then,  NS((b, b1)) = [{x1, x2, x4, x6}, {x1, x2, x4, x6}], NS((c, c1 ? c2)) =  [{x1, x4, x8}, {x2, x3, x5, x6, x7}], NS((d, d1 ? d2)) = [{x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x7}, {x6}], NS((b, b1) ? (c, c1 ? c2)) = [{x1, x4}, {x2, x6}].

Clearly, sup(r) = 1 and conf(r) = 1 ? 1 = 1/2.



IV. DISCOVERING ACTION RULES AND ACTION PATHS  The strategy for discovering candidate association action rules was presented in [10]. Influence matrix associated with S is used to identify which candidate association action rules and which action paths are valid with respect to meta-actions and hidden correlations between classification attributes and decision attributes.

Assume that S = (X,A, V ) is an information system, A = {A1, A2, ..., Am}, {M1,M2, ...,Mn} are meta-actions associated with S, {Ei,j : 1 ? i ? n, 1 ? j ? m} is an influence matrix, and r = [(A[i,1], a[i,1] ? a[j,1]) ? (A[i,2], a[i,2] ? a[j,2]) ? ..... ? (A[i,k], a[i,k] ? a[j,k])] ? [(A[i,k+1], a[i,k+1] ? a[j,k+1]) ? (A[i,k+2], a[i,k+2] ? a[j,k+2]) ? ..... ? (A[i,p], a[i,p] ? a[j,p])] is a candi- date association action rule extracted from S, where A[i,1], A[i,2], ....., A[i,k], A[i,k+1], A[i,k+2], ....., A[i,p] ? A.

We assume that A[i,j](Mi) = Ei,j for any 1 ? i ? n, 1 ? j ? m. Value Ei,j is either an atomic action term or NULL (not defined). By meta-actions based information system, we mean a triple consisting with S, the set of meta-actions associated with S, and the influence matrix linking them.

We say that r is valid in S with respect to meta-action Mi, if the following condition holds:  if (?p ? k)[A[i,p](Mi) is defined], then (?p ? k)[ if A[i,p](Mi) is defined, then  (A[i,p], a[i,p] ? a[j,p]) = (A[i,p], Ei,p)] We say that r is valid in S with respect to the set of meta-  actions M , where M ? {M1,M2, ...,Mn}, if r is valid in S with respect to each meta-action in M .

We say that the set of meta-actions M covers association action rule r = [(A[i,1], a[i,1] ? a[j,1]) ? (A[i,2], a[i,2] ? a[j,2]) ? ..... ? (A[i,k], a[i,k] ? a[j,k])] ? [(A[i,k+1], a[i,k+1] ? a[j,k+1])?(A[i,k+2], a[i,k+2] ? a[j,k+2])?.....?(A[i,p], a[i,p] ? a[j,p])] in S if r is valid in S with respect to the set of meta- actions M and  (?p ? k)[(?Mi ? M)[Mi(A[i,p]) = a[i,p] ? r is valid in S with respect to Mi]].

To give an example, assume that S is an information sys- tem represented by Table 1 and {M1,M2,M3,M4,M5,M6} is the set of meta-actions assigned to S with an influence matrix shown in Table 3. Any empty slot in Table 3 represents NULL value.

a b c M1 b1 c2 ? c1 M2 a2 ? a1 b2 M3 a1 ? a2 c2 ? c1 M4 b1 c1 ? c2 M5 c1 ? c2 M6 a1 ? a2 b1  Table 3: Influence Matrix associated with S  In the previous section we explained the strategy for discovering candidate association action rules. Two such rules have been constructed:  r1 = [[(b, b1) ? (c, c1 ? c2)] ? (d, d1 ? d2)] and r2 = [(a, a2 ? a1) ? (d, d1 ? d2)].

Clearly r1 is valid in S with respect to M4, M5, and M6.

Action rule r2 is valid in S with respect to M1, M2, M4, and M5. The meta-action M4 covers rule r1. Also the set of meta-actions {M5,M6} covers that rule.

Assume that S = (X,A ? {d}, V ) is an information sys- tem with meta-actions M = {M1,M2, ...,Mn} associated with S. Any candidate association action rule extracted from S which is covered by a subset of meta-actions in M is called association action rule. In such a case we will also say that the validation process for a candidate association action rule was positive.

Assume now that R is the set of candidate association action rules generated by the algorithm presented in the previous section. The last step in the process of association action rules discovery is used to identify which rules in R are covered by some meta-actions from M .

In our example, r1 is an association action rule because the meta-action M4 covers it. Rule r1 is also applicable to x1 and x4. So, the meta-action M4 will trigger r1 which in turn will generate two new tuples: y1 as the result of its application to x1 and y2 as the result of its application to x4. The resulting information system is of type ? (see [2]) and it is given below:     a b c d x1 a1 b1 c1 d1 x2 a2 b1 c2 d1 x3 a2 b2 c2 d1 x4 a2 b1 c1 d1 x5 a2 b3 c2 d1 x6 a1 b1 c2 d2 x7 a1 b2 c2 d1 x8 a1 b2 c1 d3 y1 a1 b1 c2 (d2, 1/2) y4 a2 b1 c2 (d2, 1/2)  Table 4 : Information System S1.

New candidate association action rules can be extracted from S1, using algorithm similar to the one presented in [10], and next their validity is verified by meta-actions and the corresponding influence matrix associated with S1. Now, if any new association action rules are extracted, then S1 will be updated again and the process will continue till the fix point is reached (information system is not changed).

The validation process for action paths with respect to meta-actions and hidden correlations between classifica- tion attributes and the decision attribute is similar to the validation process for association action rules. Just, we have to verify if action rules used to define each path are valid with respect to meta-actions and correlations between classification and decision attributes.



V. CONCLUSION  We have introduced a meta-action based information system which is as a triple (S, {Mi : i ? n}, {Ei,j : i ? n, j ? m}), where Mi are meta-actions associated with S, and {Ei,j : i ? n, j ? m} is an influence matrix linking them. Meta-actions jointly with the influence matrix are used as a postprocessing tool in association action rules discovery. Influence matrix shows the correlations among attributes triggered off by meta-actions. If the candidate association actions rules are not on par with them, then they are not classified as association action rules. However, if the influence matrix does not show all the interactions between classification attributes, then still some of the resulting association action rules may fail when tested on real data.
