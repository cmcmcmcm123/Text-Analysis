Identifying RESTful Web Services in Service-oriented Software  Product Line

Abstract?In cloud computing, SaaS provider provides applications as services through the Internet. In order to enable SaaS provider to meet the requirements of different tenants as much as possible, we used the method for core asset development in service-oriented software product line to develop the service set provided by SaaS provider. Feature- oriented domain analysis (FODA) is a common used method in the core asset development, but when it is applied to the service-oriented software product line, it has some limitations: 1) Before developing the core asset, we need to know what services are included in the core asset, but FODA is lack of the capability to identify what services need to be developed. 2) Multiple architecture styles of services in the core asset can lead to the result that the target system may use various methods to call for services and make the development of the target system complex. To solve these problems, firstly, we selected RESTful web service as the service type in the core asset to enable the target system call for services in a unified way. Then we proposed an object-operation-independent feature model according to the characteristic of RESTful web services. Finally, we designed a method to identify RESTful web services from the object-operation-independent feature model. Through the verification, the proposed method can support the identification of services in the core asset and enable the target system call for services in a unified way.

I.  INTRODUCTION Cloud computing refers to applications delivered as  services over the Internet[1][2]. Software as a Service (SaaS) is a form to provide services. A SaaS provider need to meet the requirements of different tenants as much as possible to get more benefits. The requirements of the tenants in a specific application domain have many commonalities and variability. The core asset also reflects the commonalities and variability in a specific domain. So the service set provided by the SaaS provider is similar to the core asset in the software product line. For the similarity between core asset and service set provided by SaaS providers, we can use the method for core asset development in the service- oriented software product line to develop the service set provided by SaaS provider in a specific domain. Feature-  oriented domain analysis (FODA) is a common used method in the core asset development phase, but when it is used in the service-oriented software product line, some problems arise, such as identifying what services need to be developed to form the core asset from the feature model, how to unify the architecture style of the services to enable the target system call for services in a unified way and so on. Among these problems, the most important one is identifying what services need to be developed to form the core asset, because the core asset is the fundamental of product development and the most important output in the core asset development phase.

Since identifying what services need to be developed from the feature model is the most key point in the core asset development, many studies have been taken on it. Guo Ying etc.[3] proposed a method to combine service-oriented method and domain engineering together, and propose a new concept named Domain Service, and give the acquisition process and OWL-S based ontology definition of Domain Service. Dongsu Kang and Doo-Kweon Baik[4] proposed a service identification method that bridges the feature models of product lines and the business process models. Paul Istoan etc.[5] distinguished between two types of features: atomic and composite, this method makes the entire system to be ultimately built from atomic features, mapped directly onto a set of existing services. Though from a certain extent, these methods can solve the problem of service identification, the architecture style of services is not taken into consideration, and this is likely to lead the result that the target system may use various methods to call for services and make the development of the target system complex.

For the above situation, in this paper we propose a method to identify what services need to be developed to form the core asset. In order to enable the target system call for services in a unified way, we choose RESTful web services[6][7] as the service type for the core asset.

Therefore the identified web services need to be easy to develop as RESTful web services. According to the characteristic that RESTful web services are resources- based, we propose an Object-Operation-Independent(OOI) feature model that separates the business object and operation. And in order to describe OOI feature model clearly, we design a meta-model for it. Finally, we propose a RESTful web services identification method based on the   DOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.65    DOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.65     OOI feature model to get what services need to be developed to form the core asset.

In general, the main works of this paper are: 1)  propose using the method for core asset development  in the service-oriented software product line to develop the service set provided by SaaS provider,  2) propose an Object-Operation-Independent(OOI) feature model that separates the business object and operation, and design its meta-model,  3) propose a method to identify service sets from the OOI feature model and refine the identified service sets, finally acquire the web services need to be developed in the core asset,  4) select RESTful web services as the service type in the core asset and verify the works by using an example of general cargo transport system domain.

This method can be used in the core asset development phase of service-oriented product line. Before the core asset is developed by the SaaS providers, providers need to know what web services they need to develop. Then when domain experts and molders have modeled the OOI feature model, domain engineers can use this method to identify what RESTful web services need to be developed, and tell SaaS providers to develop. Through the verification, this method can identify what RESTful web services need to be developed in the core asset development phase.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives the overview of the identification method.

Section 3 illustrates the meta-model and feature model that separates the business object and operation. Section 4 introduces the approach of identifying services from the OOI feature model. Section 5 gives examples by using our approach and discussion of the approach. Section 6 is the conclusion.



II. OVERVIEW OF IDENTIFICATION METHOD This method is used in the core asset development phase  in service-oriented product line, and its objective is to identify what services need to be developed to form the core asset. Fig. 1 gives the overview of the service-oriented product line development process.

In Fig. 1, the activities surrounded by the dotted box are the activities in the identification method. The method is used in the core asset development phase of service-oriented software product line. According to the application requirements of all types of enterprises in a specific domain, domain experts and modelers analyze the requirements and model the OOI feature model together. OOI feature model will be described in detail in the following. When the feature model modeled, domain engineers use the OOI feature model to identify what RESTful web services need to be developed to form the core asset and what resources are involved in these services. The identification method includes three activities, and what each activity does will be introduced in detail in the following. After service identification, we will get a list of the RESTful web services needed to be developed and SaaS provider will develop services according to the list. SaaS provider can develop services that meet the requirements of different tenants so far.

Fig. 1.   Overview of  Service-oriented Product Line Development Process  In product development phase, when tenant has specific requirements, developers analyze the requirements and use services directly or develop its own system by using services provided by SaaS provider. Developer can subscribe to the service and get the services from cloud.

This section introduces the overview of the identification method, and the position it is in the whole service-oriented software product line. Next section will introduce the OOI feature model.



III. OOI FEATURE MODEL Feature model describes the commonalities and  variability of all products in a specific domain. It is the fundamental for identifying and developing core asset. For RESTful web services are selected to be the services type in this paper, the traditional feature model cannot support service identification well. So we propose an Object- Operation-Independent (OOI) feature model that separates business object and operation to support the service identification.

A. Meta-model of OOI Feature Model Fig. 2 shows the meta-model of the OOI feature model.

From the meta-model, it can be seen that there are three new elements that are proposed by us and not included in the traditional feature model. The three elements are the subclasses operation feature, object feature and operated-by.

The class feature represents commonalities or variability in a specific domain. The property type has two types of     Fig. 2. Meta-model of OOI Feature Model  values. Feature has two subclasses operation feature and object feature, these two subclasses help separate the business object and operation in the domain. Class relationship represents the relationship between features, and has four subclasses. Operated-by is a new relationship that represents object feature needs to be operated by operation feature. The class constraint represents some constraints between features that cannot be represented by relationship.

Constraint also have two subclasses.

B. Formal Expression of OOI Feature Model When model the OOI feature model, there are some  constraints need to pay attention to: - the object feature need to be the parent node of the  related operation feature, - the relationship between object feature and related  operation feature need to be operated-by, - in the normal case the secondary node is an object  feature.

According to the meta-model, the final feature model can  be represented as FM.

Definition 1. OOI feature model is represented as FM =  (F, R, C).

OOI feature model is mainly composed of feature set F,  relationship set R, and constraint set C.

Definition 2. Feature set is represented as F = (FName,  FType, Fdescription, FC), FC = (OBF, OPF).

FName represents the name of the feature. FType  represents the type of the feature. Namely the feature is mandatory or optional. Fdescription represents the description of the feature. FC represents which class is the feature belonging to, either OBF or OPF. OBF represents object feature and OPF represents operation feature.

Definition 3. Relationship set is represented as R = (Rname, RParent, RChild, RC), RC = (Composed-by, Implemented-by, Specialization, Operated-by).

Rname represents the name of the relationship. RParent represents the parent node in a relationship. RChild represents the child node in a relationship. RC represents which class is the relationship belongs to, Composed-by, Implemented-by, Specialization or Operated-by.

Definition 4. Constraint set is represented as C = (CName, CFormer, CLatter, CC), CC = (Require, Exclude).

CName represents the name of the constraint. CFormer represents the former feature in the constraint. CLatter represents the latter feature in the constraint. For example, in the constraint A requires B, CFormer is A and CLatter is B.

CC represents which class is the relationship belong to, Require or Exclude.

This section introduces the meta-model and the formal expression of the OOI feature model, and the next section will introduce the identification method of RESTful services from the OOI feature model.



IV. IDENTIFYING RESTFUL WEB SERVICES Through the feature modeling activity, we get the OOI  feature model which shows commonalities and variability between products in a specific domain. Then we will identify services through analyzing OOI feature model.

Since we select RESTful web services as the type of services, resources become the main focus in the identification method. Fig. 3 shows the identification process of our method.

There are three activities in the whole process. Activity 1 dividing features into groups to form the candidate service sets. Activity 2 refining the candidate service sets to get service sets. Activity 3 defining RESTful web services from the service sets to get the services need to be developed in the core asset development phase. The three activities will be introduced in detail in the following sections.

A. Dividing Features into Groups The first activity of the identification method is dividing  features into groups to form the candidate service set.

Definition 5. Candidate service set is a subset of the  feature model,  root n  i i FCSFM +=  =? 1  (1)  )( FFFCS ii ?=?          (2) A candidate service set CS is composed of some features  in the feature model, and the feature model is the union set of  Fig. 3. Identification Process of RESTful Web Services     all candidate service sets and the root feature.

When dividing features into candidate service sets, we do  as following steps.

Step 1. Find key feature used to group. Since there is the  constraint that in the normal case the secondary node is an object feature, and the main concern of RESTful web services is resources (i.e. business object). The feature represented by the secondary node of the feature model is selected as the key feature of each candidate service set.

Step 2. Grouping features according to the key feature.

When the key feature is selected, then all features in the feature model will be divided into groups according to the relationships between the key feature and themselves.

Grouping rules are:  - in a relationship R, if the RParent is the key feature, then RChild is grouped into the key feature?s candidate service set.

- in a relationship R, if the RParent is already in a candidate service set, then RChild is grouped into the same candidate service set.

B. Refining Candidate Service Set After the activity of dividing features into groups, we  will get a series candidate service sets. Since the candidate service sets are coarse-grained, developing RESTful web services according to the candidate service set is not proper.

The candidate service sets need to be further refined to get services set in moderate granularity.

When refining candidate service set, the object feature is also the main focus, and the method is composed of the following steps.

Step1. Deciding whether to refine the candidate service set according to the number of object features in the candidate service set.

If the number of object features in the candidate service set is only one. Then the candidate service set is not needed to be refined. If the number of object features in the candidate service set is more than one. Then the candidate service set needed to be refined.

Step 2. Extract new service set from the candidate service set needed to be refined.

If a feature is an object feature in a candidate service set, then form a new service set that the key feature is the object feature. All features associated with the key feature will be added to the new service set. And all operation features associated with the key feature?s parent feature will also be added into the new service set.

Step 3. Refining new service sets to form the final service sets. After all object features in the candidate service set forming new service sets, delete the service sets that the key feature has child object feature.

C. Defining RESTful Web Services After the activity of refining candidate service set, we  will get a series service sets. However, only service sets are not enough. Developer cannot develop RESTful services according to the services sets that composed of features. So we need to define RESTful services that need to be developed from the service sets. Then this section will  introduce the approach to define RESTful web services from the service sets.

For each service set, there is an object feature in the set and many operation features. Then analyzing the operation features.

Case 1. if the operation feature is one of the types add, delete, get, update, analyze that the resource it operated is the object feature itself or a collection of the object features or a property in the object feature. Then merge the operation features all of this type with the resource it operated group by the specific resource to form a RESTful web service;  Case 2. if the operation feature is not one of the four types add, delete, get, update, then analyze what atomic operations are included in the operation feature, and whether each atomic operation belongs to the four types operations or not. If an atomic operation belongs to the four types operations, then follow case 1 to get a RESTful web service.

If an atomic operation does not belong to the four types operations (i.e. the operation is a complicated processing procedure), then regard a service provided the operation as a resource, and then the service resource included a get operation as a RESTful web service.

D. Develop RESTful Web Services After the activity of defining RESTful web services, we  will get a list of the RESTful web services needed to be developed in the core asset development phase. Then SaaS provider can develop services according to the list.

This section introduces the identification method of RESTful web services that need to be developed from the OOI feature model, and the next section will introduce a case study using the OOI feature model and the identification method.



V. CASE STUDY General cargo transport system domain is chosen to be  the specific domain used to verify our method. General cargo transport system is a system that provides support to manage the business process of the enterprises running general cargo transport. The SaaS provider needs to provide services for enterprises running general cargo transport.

A. OOI Feature Model of  General Cargo Transport System Domain Firstly, an OOI feature model of general cargo transport  system domain will be modeled. During the process of modeling, there are some points need to pay attention to other than the constraints OOI feature model needed. The points are:  - Completeness. The features need to reflect the whole business process, and there is no key point missed.

- Universality. The features need to be suitable for most enterprises, so the enterprises of all kinds of size should be taken into consideration to ensure generality.

According to all the requirements, we refer to the business process of relevant enterprises running general cargo transport of all kinds of size (e.g., large, medium, small), then we choose the critical and practical node and     abstract them into features. Fig. 4 shows a simplified OOI feature model of general cargo transport system domain.

From Fig. 4, we can see that different from traditional feature model, the OOI feature model separates business object and operation. In the figure, grey rectangle represents object feature and white rectangle represents operation feature. Dot dash line represents the relationship operated- by.

B. Identifying RESTful Web Services When the OOI feature model is modeled, the RESTful  web services that need to be developed in the core asset development phase will be identified.

Step1: Dividing Features into Groups Firstly, features in the feature model will be divided into  groups to form candidate service sets. According to the steps mentioned in the Chapter 3, the candidate service sets are acquired. Fig. 5 shows the candidate service sets. From Fig.

5, we can see that there are four candidate service sets.

Step2: Refining Candidate Service Set When we get candidate service sets, nextly the candidate  service sets will be refined to get service sets. In the case study, CS1 is chosen as the candidate service sets to verify the refining method.

Since there are three object features in the CS1, so the candidate service sets need to be refined. Then the analysis will be taken against each feature in the three features.

Firstly, advance order is chosen as the key feature to form a new set service set 1, and then transfer has relationship with it, so transfer is added into the new set service set 1. Secondly, the parent node order of advance  Fig. 4. A Simplified OOI Feature Model of General Cargo Transport System Domain  Fig. 5. Candidate Service Sets of General Cargo Transport System Domain  order has relationship with enter and audit, so enter and audit will be also added into the service set 1.

In a similar way, service set 2 which key feature is consignment note and service set 3 which key feature is order will be get. But the key feature order has child features, so service set 3 is deleted.

Finally, we get two refined service sets: service set 1 = {advance order, transfer, enter, audit}, service set 2 = {consignment note, scan, sign for, enter,  audit}.

Step3: Defining RESTful Web Services Then RESTful web services will be identified from the  service set. Service set 1 will be chosen as the example.

Firstly, the three operation features in the service set 1 are analyzed. Enter is the add operation on the resource advance order, so it is defined as a RESTful web service that operated resource is advance order. Audit is the update operation on the resource status property of advance order, so it is defined as a RESTful web service that operated resource is the status property of advance order. Transfer is not one of the four types operations add, delete, update, get, so we analyze the atomic operations transfer includes, transfer operation includes two atomic operations get and transfer. Get is the get operation on the resource advance order, so it is also defined as the RESTful web service that operated resource is advance order. And transfer does not belong to four types operations, so treat the service providing the transfer function as a resource, then transfer is the get operation of the service resource, so it is defined as a RESTful web service that operated resource is transferservice.

Table 1 shows the RESTful web services and the input and output parameters of the RESTful web services identified from CS1.

TABLE I.  INPUT AND OUTPUT PARAMETERS OF THE RESTFUL WEB SERVICES IDENTIFIED FROM CANDIDATE SERVICE SET 1  RESTful web service Operation  Input parameters  Output parameters  AdvanceOrder Add date, consigner, address  advanceOrder Number  AdvanceOrder Get advanceOrderNumber advanceOrder  AdvanceOrder/stat us Update  date, operator, advanceOrder Number, status  boolean  TransferService Get advanceOrder consignmentOrder  ConsignmentNote Add  date, operator, consigner, address, consignee  consignmentN oteNumber  ConsignmentNote/ status Update  consignmentN oteNumber, status  boolean  ConsignmentNote/l ocation Update  consignmentN oteNumber, location  boolean  Step4: Develop RESTful Web Services After defining RESTful web services, we have the list of RESTful web services needed to be developed by the SaaS provider. SaaS provider can develop services according to     the information provided by the list. Fig. 6 shows part of the wadl of the RESTful web service AdvanceOrder.

C. Discussion Table 2 shows the contrast between service-oriented  product line using OOI feature model and traditional service- oriented product line. The result shows that OOI feature model and the related service identification method can support the identification of RESTful web services and rapid development of service-oriented systems.

Fig. 6. Wadl of the RESTful Web Service Advanceorder  TABLE II.  CONTRAST BETWEEN SERVICE-ORIENTED PRODUCT LINE USING OOI FEATURE MODEL AND TRADITIONAL SERVICE-ORIENTED  PRODUCT LINE  Aspect Development method  Service-oriented product line using OOI feature  model  Traditional service- oriented product line  Feature model  In addition to the elements traditional feature model has, there are new elements object feature, operation feature, operated-by relationship.

Only the basic elements needed to represent the features in a specific domain.

Support to service  identificatio n  Can support identification of RESTful web services efficiently.

Can identify services, but cannot unify the architecture styles of services.

The method target  system call for services  Can use a unified method to call for services.

Need to use different methods to call for different types of services.

Maintainabi lity  Easy, when need to modify operation ,only modify operation feature; and if need to modify business object, just modify the object feature, and this change do not affect operation feature.

Hard, especially need to modify business object, then all operation related to the object will need to re-implement.



VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we use the method for core asset  development in the service-oriented software product line to develop the service set provided by SaaS providers in cloud computing. We proposed an OOI feature model that  separates the business object and operation, introduced the meta-model and the formal expression of the OOI feature model. We chose RESTful web service as the service type for the core asset, since it is simpler to implement and use.

Then we proposed an identification method of RESTful web services from the OOI feature model. Finally, we verified the OOI feature model and the identification method by using an example of general cargo transport system domain.

The next step of work to do is to manage the RESTful web services identified for improving reusability and maintainability, and provide computer automation support for the identification of RESTful web services.
