Analysis and development of a reliable fixed wing UAV  control system for mission profiles with restricted GPS

Abstract ? This paper is motivated by the actual need for safer and more reliable flight control systems for fixed wing UAVs. In certain mission scenarios, it is necessary to fly close to big structures at low altitudes where the availability of GPS sensor data cannot be guaranteed. Two different control strategies have been analyzed, with the main difference consisting in the utilization of GPS data for flight control. An extended system allowing those two control strategies to complement one to another has been developed. Its performance has been analyzed through simulation and in flight experiments. The result is a more reliable flight control system for flying in areas with restricted GPS signal.



I. INTRODUCTION The interest in small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been rising in the past years, due to the variety of possibilities they offer. UAVs are already being used for diverse purposes such as remote sensing, traffic monitoring, search and rescue missions, mapping, and surveillance while new application scenarios are being discovered  continuously. For the successful execution of most missions, autonomous flight capabilities are required in order to perform a given task without or with only little, manual guidance. These capabilities are implemented by means of suitable sensors and on-board processing capabilities. An accurate estimation of all system states is needed. Commonly used state estimation methods are based on Kalman filters [1]. Many researchers have studied the problems involved in the guidance and control of small UAVs in environments with restricted conditions, such as lack of GPS signal or poor visibility. To cope with the difficulties arising from the mentioned constraints, they have used a variety of sensors such as lasers or vision sensors, in addition to the most common combination of GPS and INS sensors [2], [3], [4].

During the analysis and development of an integrated UAV system, many aspects have to be considered. Among others, these could include the airframe configuration, the sensor system, the flight control system and the communication system. In this paper we focus on the development of the control strategy.

May 28-31, 2013, Grand Hyatt Atlanta, Atlanta, GA     The DLR Robotics and Mechatronics Center and the Avionics Department of FADA-CATEC have been working on different control strategies for different types of fixed wing UAVs. The goal of the joint work presented here was to investigate the experiences and results made with the different systems and to come up with a new solution that allows those systems to complement each other and answer the need for higher reliability and safety.

This paper is organized as follows: in section 2 a detailed description of both controllers with diagrams will be given and the differences between both strategies will be explained. The simulation environment and results of the performance analysis for each control structure will be shown in section 3. In section 4 the flight experiment setup and the results obtained from telemetry will be described. In section 5 a backup system will be proposed based on a combination of the previously evaluated strategies along with simulation results. Finally, concluding remarks will be presented in section 6.



II. DESCRIPTION OF CONTROLLER SCHEMES Two different control strategies will be compared in this section.

The first controller to be considered will be identified with the letter A and is based on GPS sensor data for the calculation of certain variables in the basic flight control loops. On the other hand, the controller identified with B does not use GPS data to perform the task of flight control. The design of these controllers has been implemented in Matlab/Simulink. Only level flight and trajectory following phases of the flight plan have been analyzed. This paper does not deal with the take-off and landing phases.

Firstly, it is necessary to adapt the inputs of both controllers to the outputs of the flight guidance module (navigator). It is important to standardize the coordinate systems and the data units for both controllers. There are three main inputs: airspeed, height and course. These inputs represent the desired values computed in the navigator and, if maintained correctly by the flight controller, will lead the UAV to perform  the commanded flight plan. A standard fixed wing UAV requires four control parameters where one is related to the engine and the other three are related to three available control surfaces: the elevator, the ailerons and the rudder. In our case the rudder will not be used for flight control. The rudder is usually used for turn coordination and for the compensation of lateral winds. Furthermore, the rudder could also be used in the take-off and landing phases in order to align the UAV with the runway. In this paper we will assume that the rudder remains in the trim position during the whole experiment.

The high level structure of both controllers is composed of three main blocks. The output of each block corresponds to the respective input parameter which is to be controlled and represents the available corrective action (as input to the aircraft?s flight dynamics). Each block represents an independent control loop and will be named after its input parameter. This means that throttle is the output of the airspeed control loop, the elevator output corresponds to the height control loop and the ailerons to the course control loop. Accordingly the input / output table looks as follows:  Airspeed ? Throttle Height  ?  Elevator Course  ?  Aileron  Both, controller A and controller B use a set of cascaded PI controllers. The differences between them appear on the inside of the three main blocks. Controller A is based on GPS sensor data and involves different control loops than controller B, where the used sensor data is based on inertial and barometric measurements. Hence, controller A is suitable for platforms which offer very accurate GPS data (e.g. using enhancement methods like differential GPS) and where failures or signal loss are rather unlikely. This controller would be suitable when precise trajectory following is required. On the other hand, controller B is appropriate for platforms on which GPS data is not as reliable. Sometimes flight plans include areas with poor GPS coverage and it would be dangerous to solely depend on that data.

The approach for the analysis of the schemes presented below is as follows: each control loop is described for both, controller A and controller B and the differences between them are pointed out.

Airspeed control loop The throttle command (?t) is computed directly from the airspeed loop. It consists of a PI controller accounting for the airspeed error, and a Feed-Forward term adding in a predefined throttle position depending on the commanded airspeed.

The average throttle position can be calculated as a function of airspeed based on telemetry from manual flights. This function has to be determined for the operational range of airspeeds for a given UAV. This means that when a certain airspeed is commanded, the expected throttle position is applied and the PI controller will work with the errors around the commanded value. The variables appearing in Fig. 1 refer to the airspeed command Vcmd and the airspeed V.

Fig. 1: Airspeed control loop for both controllers.

Due to this Feed-Forward (FF) term, the airspeed controller is more reactive which helps the aircraft in reaching the commanded airspeed faster.

Height control loop The height control loop acts on the longitudinal dynamics of the UAV which will be considered as decoupled from the lateral aircraft dynamics.

It is advisable though to couple them in order not to lose height in turns, as will be discussed later.

Also, airspeed and height will be controlled separately, without any direct coupling, which is a common approach.

The biggest difference between the two controllers lies within this loop. The global inputs and outputs are the same for both  controllers, but the inner control loop structure is different. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 illustrate the two proposed control schemes where the GPS dependent signals are labeled in bold. The variables in the following figures and expressions refer to: height command hcmd, GPS height hgps, barometric height hbar, climb angle command ?cmd, climb angle ?, pitch angle command ?cmd, pitch angle ? angle of attack ?, angle of attack command ?cmd, GPS velocity Vgps, pitch rate q, pitch rate command qcmd, pitch rate compensation for turns qcomp, and elevator command ?e.

Controller A                     Fig. 2: Height control loop for controller A (based on  GPS).

Controller B              Fig. 3: Height control loop for controller B (independent of  GPS) with Stability Augmentation System (SAS)  q  ?e  q  qcmd    Vgps      +  -  Eq. 2  +  +  P +  -  P error_q  ?e  +    +    +    SAS (damping)  q  hcmd  hbar PI error_h +  -    +  -  error_ P I  Eq. 2    V P  PI  Vcmd  V +  +  error_V  ?t + +  FF  + -  P I  error_?    hcm   hgps error_h  ??  Vgps  Eq.

+  -  P I  qcomp       With climb angle:  = ?  (1)  and pitch rate turn compensation  =   (2)  Here ? is the roll angle. The second equation represents the aforementioned coupling between the longitudinal and lateral dynamics of the aircraft and is called turn compensation [5], [6].

A pitch rate command is calculated from the current flight velocity and roll angle preventing the aircraft to pitch down and loose height when the vertical component of the tilted lift force is reduced in turns.

As can be seen in the above control schemes, both controllers are based on a set of cascaded P and PI controllers. The main difference can be found in the output of the outer loop. In controller A the desired climb angle is generated from a difference in height. In controller B the desired pitch angle is calculated from a given height difference.

It should be noted that the climb angle determines the UAV?s flight path and therefore directly relates to a change in height (1). Instead, the pitch angle is related to the UAV?s attitude, and is computed as the angle between the longitudinal axis of the aircraft and the horizontal plane. It is thus only indirectly related to a change in height as steady flight conditions can be obtained with different trim pitch angles.

The climb angle depends on both the pitch angle and the angle of attack:  :   = +   (3)   Course control loop The course control loop acts on the lateral dynamics of the aircraft. As mentioned before, it can be treated as completely decoupled from the longitudinal dynamics. This loop is very similar for both controllers. Differences can be found in the utilization of GPS data for the computation of the roll angle in controller A as well as the  different configuration of the roll rate loop. The roll rate loop is the innermost loop of cascaded controller A with a dynamically generated command variable. On the other hand, it represents a Stability Augmentation System (SAS) in controller B with a constant desired roll rate of zero. Mathematically these two variations can be transformed into one another and are equivalent. Hence, similar performance is expected in lateral dynamics for both controllers.

Again, the GPS dependent data is in bold characters. The variables that appear in the next figures and expressions refer to: course command ?cmd, GPS course ?gps, magnetometer course ?mag, course rate command ? , GPS velocity Vgps, roll angle command , roll angle , roll rate p, roll rate command pcmd, aileron command ?a.

The following equation is then used to compute the roll angle from measured GPS velocity Vgps and desired course change rate ?:  ? = ? (4)

III. SIMULATION RESULTS For simulations, a flight dynamics model based on [7] and [8] has been used. That model had been validated for a different aircraft with smaller mass but similar flight characteristics.

Certain parameters were changed in order to adapt to the mass and geometry settings of the platform we intended to use in flight experiments. The model was then utilized to determine an initial set of autopilot gains to be used as a starting point for the manual tuning procedure. This approach has been proven valid before, when it was applied to the above mentioned heavier and larger aerial platform and flight controller A. It contains a 6-DOF non- linear aircraft model where forces generated by the plane?s aerodynamic surfaces (including the fuselage), the engine thrust and the non-linear actuator behavior have been considered. The thrust model has been determined from actual measurements on the ground as described in [8].

The contact forces of the landing gear have been incorporated as well, but are of no interest for this paper.

Longitudinal dynamics results In this section, the simulation results for the height control loop will be presented. Fig. 6 shows the step response of both controllers for different height steps.

Even with the appropriate controller gain combination (calculation based on a simplified linear model using pole placement and successive manual fine-tuning) an overshoot can be observed for controller B. This behavior cannot be observed for controller A where no overshoot occurs. The explanation can be found in the different control structures of controller A and controller B (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). As described above, climb angle is used as one of the control variables in controller A. This parameter is a  component of the functional chain of the aircrafts flight dynamics where it directly precedes the actual height change. This means that a change in climb angle will necessarily and immediately induce a change in height. On the other hand, by calculating climb angle from height control deviation (instead of pitch angle as done in controller B) the influence of the angle of attack is not relevant. As for controller B, depending on the angle of attack, different pitch angles can lead to the same flight condition which especially makes an impact during the unsteady transition phases where the overshoot occurs.

Another significant difference is the higher number of cascaded loops present in controller A. Due to the additional loop, controller A can account for disturbances in the primary variable faster and control it more effectively. It also reduces the effects of dead time and phase lag time in the system.

Fig. 6: Height control loop performance for both  controllers in nonlinear simulation  The next figure shows the behavior in pitch- and climb angle for both controllers when performing the steps in height. Controller A is very reactive and performs changes in both angles faster than controller B.

As described in the controller scheme section, the structure of both lateral controllers does not differ significantly.

Hence, a similar behavior was expected. Fig. 8 shows the simulation results; as expected, the lateral flight control performance is very similar in both cases.

IV. FLIGHT TESTS The flight experiments have been performed using ELWIRA, one of DLR?s fixed wing platforms as shown in Fig.  9.

Fig.  9: ELWIRA platform used for flight experiments  With a wingspan of 4.3m and a maximum payload of 20kg ELWIRA is an electrically powered universal test platform suitable for most experiments without the need for miniaturization. The available sensor data consists of inertial measurement data, data from the Air Data System and the data derived from differential GPS (DGPS) working in RTK mode (positioning accuracy of several centimeters).

The ground control equipment consisted of a computer running the Matlab/Simulink, a second computer for telemetry monitoring, the communications equipment and the DGPS  ground station. The communications link is established by means of a wireless 5.8GHz router and a 2.4GHz digital modem as backup solution in case of communication loss. The 5.8GHz high gain antenna has been mounted on an antenna tracker constantly pointing at the aircraft whereat the 2.4GHz omnidirectional antenna was installed on the ground. During the whole flight the safety pilot had the option to switch off the autopilot system and gain full RC control of the aircraft.

As mentioned before all flight control laws have been designed and analyzed with Matlab/Simulink. The Simulink Real Time Workshop (RTW) toolbox has been used for automatic code generation and the code has been compiled for the real-time operating system QNX which is running on the Flight Control Computer. Considering the existing aircraft model as representative enough, it has been used to calculate a first set of controller gains as starting point for a manual tuning procedure. In doing so, the airspeed controller was first tuned, then the height controller, and finally the course controllers.

Longitudinal dynamics results For the analysis of the longitudinal dynamics, it is important to consider both the performance of the height controller as well as the airspeed controller performance. The nominal cruise airspeed for the ELWIRA platform is 22 m/s.

Fig. 10 shows a sequence of the airspeed controller performance during the flight experiments. A good general aircraft behavior can be observed.

Fig. 10: Airspeed control loop performance in real flight  At the moment, few flight experiments have been conducted. The tuning of the height controller has shown to be complex and time-  0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 -200  -150  -100  -50       time (s)  Co ur  se (d  eg )      Reference controller B controller A  0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160  -60  -40  -20      time (s)  Ro ll a  ng le  (d eg  )      controller B controller A  350 360 370 380 390 400 410 420 430 440         A irs  pe ed  ( m  /s )  time (s)     consuming, due its higher number of cascaded loops. It was important to fly in a straight line during the basic tuning process in order to avoid the introduction of any coupling effects with the aircraft?s turning dynamics. Only by doing so it was possible to tune loop by loop, starting with the lower level loops. By following this systematic approach it should be possible to find a good set of controller gains based on the values obtained from the simulator and providing a satisfactory flight performance. Height controller A had already successfully undergone the whole tuning process as just described in previous flight experiments. Unfortunately we were not able to reach this goal for both controllers yet. As can be seen in Fig. 11 the pitch loop has been tuned successfully.

Fig. 11: Pitch loop performance of controller B in real  flight  The outer loop though, which corresponds to the height control loop, was still oscillating. After the tuning process performed so far, Controller B did allow for coarsely following a given height reference but did not perform optimally. Future analyses and flight tests will be devoted to the improvement of the tuning of controller B. The performance of both controllers in their current state is shown in Fig. 12: .

Fig. 12: Height control loop performance in real flight  At this point we can only conclude that controller B is suitable for keeping the aircraft in the air within about 15 meters of a specified altitude. A quantitative comparison of the two control strategies was not possible based on the performed flight experiments. It remains the objective of future research.

Lateral dynamics results  The course control loop performance was analyzed by following an eight-pattern waypoint route successively with both controllers. Only small differences in the performance of the course controllers were expected due to the high similarity of their control structures. Fig. 13 shows the performance of the course- and roll angle control loop. The actual differences are indeed minor.

V. BACKUP CONTROLLER STRATEGY In this section, a new strategy for an extended controller concept will be presented. As previously discussed, some applications require precise trajectory following capabilities in order to adhere to the pre-planned flight routes.

Common examples are mission scenarios such as urban surveillance or rural search and rescue missions where UAVs have to fly around buildings or other structures at low altitudes.

These environments are surrounded by abrupt terrain changes which makes precise trajectory following strictly required. In order to comply with this requirement, two factors play a crucial role. The first is the accuracy of the available positioning data (GPS) and the second is the performance of the flight controller. Controllers based on precise GPS data, such as controller A, are suitable for this kind of application. The problem arises in areas where the GPS reception  600 620 640 660 680 700 720 740 760 -30  -25  -20  -15  -10  -5       time (s)  pi tc  h an  gl e  (d eg  )      reference state  650 660 670 680 690 700 710 720 730 740 750          time (s)  he ig  ht (  m )      reference controller A  600 620 640 660 680 700 720 740 760        time (s)  he ig  ht (m  )      reference controller B  100 120 140 160 180 200 220 -200  -150  -100  -50      co  ur se  (d eg  )  time (s)      Controller B Controller A  0 20 40 60 80 100 120 -60  -40  -20      ro ll  (d eg  )  time (s)     Controller B Controller A     is compromised, which might render the positioning data untrustworthy. In that case another ?backup? controller, not requiring GPS data to perform the basic flight control tasks, would pitch in. This controller would then safely fly the aircraft until the GPS signal is recovered.

In this section a composed control structure will be proposed, having controller A commanding the aircraft when GPS data is of appropriate quality to track the pre-planned trajectory, and controller B commanding when GPS data is compromised or not available.

In addition to changing the active flight controller, it might also be necessary to change the navigation plan. If GPS positioning data is fully unavailable, it will not be possible to track a route of waypoints. In that case controller B would control the aircraft and initiate a turning maneuver with a constant course rate while increasing the altitude to a value high enough in order not to collide with any obstacle.

Fig. 15 shows the result of a simulated GPS failure. The aircraft was supposed to follow an eight-pattern route of waypoints when GPS data suddenly becomes unavailable (beginning of blue dashed line in Fig. 14 and Fig. 15). The fail- safe system kicks in (changeover to GPS independent controller B) and the aircraft starts turning around the position at which the error was first identified. During this turning maneuver the flight altitude is constantly increased to allow for a better GPS reception and consequent recovery as described above. The height controller therefore uses barometric altitude measurements as shown in Fig. 3. The height change is illustrated in Fig. 16. In the moment GPS-lock is re-established, controller A takes back control, returning the aircraft to the previous waypoint route (end of blue dashed line in Fig. 14 and Fig. 15).

Fig. 14: Simulated GPS failure   Fig. 15: Simulated trajectory with sudden GPS failure   Fig. 16: Simulated height control performance in case of  GPS failure during flight  For this type of mission profile it is important to synchronize the height information obtained through GPS measurements and by means of barometric measurements. GPS height information is given in WGS84 coordinates which can differ from the barometric height data depending on the current ground pressure and the deviation of the actual vertical temperature gradient from its definition in the standard atmosphere. It is therefore essential to synchronize both measurements before flight in order not to have offsets when changing from one to another. Another important point to be considered arises from the difference between course angle and heading. The course angle is computed from GPS velocity components and therefore represents the actual direction of flight.

In the case of GPS data being unavailable, it is only possible to compute the heading using a     magnetometer. This parameter represents the pointing direction of the aircraft?s x-axis in relation to magnetic north. The difference between both values is called sideslip angle and is caused by the wind. This means that a smoother controller switching, in terms of course control performance, can be expected in less windy conditions.



VI. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, two different flight controllers for fixed wing UAVs have been analyzed and compared. The main difference between their respective control strategies was rooted in the usage of GPS positioning data within the basic flight control loops. Apart from that, both controller concepts were similar, with some differences in the loop distribution of the cascaded control structures (especially in the longitudinal controller). Both systems have been analyzed in simulation and in flight experiments and a qualitative performance analysis has been conducted. A non-linear model of the test platform was used to compute an initial set of control parameters as starting point for the first test flights. The simulation has shown little difference between both controllers with regard to the lateral dynamics. The longitudinal controller analysis showed a small but systematic overshoot in the height step response of controller B. This effect can be led back to the use of different control variables and the unequal number of loops used in the two cascaded controllers.

Two flight tests have been performed with the ELWIRA aerial platform which was equipped with the full DLR avionics system. The lateral dynamics results were very satisfactory, as no considerable difference between both controllers was observed. However, due to the unsuccessful fine-tuning performed until now, the longitudinal controller B was still showing some oscillations in the height loop. The overshoot which has been encountered during the simulations was observed as well during the flight experiments. The successful termination of the tuning procedure for the height loop of controller B will be part of successive analyses and experiments in the future.

A new backup controller was proposed in the last section, representing a combination of both strategies. This extended controller was able to maintain safe flight conditions in cases when GPS reception was lost during flight. This behavior could only be analyzed in simulation experiments for now. The next step consists in the validation of the proposed method by means of actual flight experiments crossing over GPS denied areas.
