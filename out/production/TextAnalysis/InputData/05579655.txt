An Algorithm of Association Rules for Exploring Defects of College Teaching

Abstract- The teaching appraisal must be done every semester in most of the universities. There are large amounts of data accumulated. In order to find out the relevance between individual background of a teacher and his teaching performance, this thesis introduces an algorithm based on multidimensional Association Rules Mining, which has explored teaching defects when there are the individual differences and use the verdict to guide teachers' work.

Keywords-Data Mining; Association Rules; Teaching Appraisal; Support; Confidence

I. INTRODUCTION  For the rapid development of information technology, the teaching of Computer, Electronics etc. forms its distinguishing features. Because of the rapid update of the relevant knowledge, the teachers are required to have special ability, such as profound basic knowledge, practical experience, strong capability to accept new knowledge and quickly master the cutting-edge knowledge etc[1].

This article describes an Association Rules Mining algorithm, which is used to find the relevance between individual background of a teacher, such as age, position or education, and his teaching performance. It aims to discover the potential impact on the teaching consequence when there are the individual differences, with the purpose to guide teachers' work

II. THE CONCEPT OF ASSOCIATION RULES MINING  The Association Rules is one of the basic tasks of Data Mining, and it is used to determine the links between the different domains. That is to find the interesting connections based on the given data sets.

Given a set of items I = (I), 12 ... 1m) and a transaction database D = (t), t2'" 10), in which, ti = (Ii), li2 ... lim) and lij E

I. The Association Rules is the implication of X ? Y. In it, X and Y are items sets, respectively, and X n Y = <I> [2].

To find the interesting Association Rules, two parameters Support and Confidence need to be defined. Support of X ? Y is a percentage that shows the degree that X U Y is occupied in the all transactions of the database. Confidence means the ratio to the transactions containing X U Y and the transactions containing X, and it is a measurement of the accuracy of Association Rules. In fact, people are only interested in some Association Rules that meet the minimum degree of Support and Confidence. Therefore, in order to  lunfei Gai Information & Technology College  Hebei University of Economics & Business Shijiazhuang China  Email: renlixiaoyue@126.com  find meaningful Association Rules, two thresholds need to be offered, which are MinSupp and MinConf [3].

Confidence (X ? Y) = sup port count(X u Y) (1) sup port _ count(X)

III. THE PREPARATION FOR THE DATA  Here collected 80 teachers' personal information and the appraisal data of their teaching, which were made by the students of one college of Information & Technology. The teacher's information is composed of education, job title and age. Education is subdivided into Bachelor, Master and Doctor. The job title is subdivided into Teaching Assistant, Lecturer, Associate Professor and Professor. Ages are subdivided into three different ranges: under 30, 31-45 years old and above 45 years old. The appraisal of teaching is subdivided into the following items (shown in Table1).

Table2 is the result after data discretization. For the 10 appraisal items, because the aim is to find the unsatisfactory items rather than the good performance items, the appraisal items below 85 points are discreted into value I, which indicates that the appraisal results are unsatisfactory. The otherwise is value 0 that shows the items excellent. For example, the case of teachers No.1 is older than 45 years, Doctor and Associate Professor. In the 10 appraisal items of his teaching, E I is excellent, E2 is imperfect . . .  E9 is imperfect and E 10 is excellent.

IV. ALGORITHM ANALYSIS  A. The teacher classification Before finding the Frequency Sets, the teachers have  been classified according to their personal information. All the 80 teachers have been divided into 36 kinds of types.

For example: ?30 years old, bachelor, Teaching assistant) is type 1, ?30 years old, bachelor, lecturer) is type 2 . . .  and so on, (> 45 years old, Doctor, professor) is type 36.

1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 5 1 0 . .  1 1   To make the classification, a teacher is determined to a certain type after scanning the distribution of value 1 among the columns of age, education and title of every row in table2.

Later the classification numbers can be filled in the classification column. For example, the teacher No. 1 belongs to the 35th category, and teacher NO.2 belongs to the 22nd category. Similarly, the teacher No.80 belongs to the 5th category.

The algorithm is shown as below.

Set 4 arrays: Age(n,3), Edu(n,3), Protitle(n,4), and  ClassifY(n). Here, n is the number of teachers to be classified , Age(n, 3) is used to store the ages of the teachers , Edu (n,3) is used to place their education situation, Protitle (n, 4) is used to store their job title situation , ClassifY (n) is used to store the classification results. For example, as shown in Tablel, to the teacher NO.1 (> 45 years old, Doctor, Associate Professor), the appropriate storage of his situation in the arrays is :Age (1,1) = 0, Age (1,2) = 0 Age (1,3) = 1; Edu (1,1) = 0, Edu (1,2) = 0, Edu (1,3) = 1; Protitle (1,1) = 0, Protitle (1,2) = 0, Protitle (1,3) = 1, Protitle (1,4) = O.

For i = 1 To n fenlei(i) = "" For j = 1 To 3  If Age(i, j) = 1 Then fenlei(i) = fenlei(i) & Str(j)  For k= 1 T03 If Edu(i, k) = 1 Then  fenlei(i) = fenlei(i) & Str(k) For m = 1 To 4  If ProTitle(i, m) = 1 Then  Fenlei (i) = fenlei (i) & Str(m) End If  Next m End If  Next k End If  Next j Next i  The time complexity of the algorithm T(n) = O(n) and the space complexity of the algorithm Sen) = O(n)  B. Finding the frequency sets In this research project, Support is set 10%. The wanted  frequency sets are some subsets that are composed of the same type of teachers whose Support is more than 10%. The process to find frequent sets is as follows: in Table2, count the rows according to different classification numbers in classification column and delete those sets whose proportion is below 10%. The removed parts indicate that the quantity of this kind of teacher is too small to be a representative set.

The detail of the algorithm is as follows. In it, the number 36 represents the classification number and the standard classification numbers are stored in array Iei(i).

For i = 1 To 36 For j = 1 to n  If lei (i) = fenlei (j) Then Sumlei (i) = sumlei (i) + 1  End If Next j If sumlei(i)/n < 10% Then  Sumlei (i) = 0 End If  Next i  C. Generating the Association Rules In this project, the aim is to find the unsatisfactory  appraisal items of certain types of teacher, so a lower confidence level 40% is set. The process to generate the Association Rules is: for each frequency set generated in 4.2, its 10 teaching appraisal items are calculated in order and the results have been filled in Fig.l. Shown in Fig. l, if the Confidence of one appraisal item greater than or equal to 40%, it indicates that the teacher's teaching has problems.

The experimental result has been shown in Fig. I.

The result of Association Rules Mining  The detail of the algorithm is as follows: For i = 1 To 36  V4-88     If sumlei (i) < > 0 Then For j = 1 to n  If flag(i, j) = 1 Then For k= 0 To 9  sumping(i, k) = sumping(i, k) + EvaG, k) Next k Fork=O To 9  sumping(i, k) = sumping(i, k) / sumlei(i) If sumpingl(i, k) < 0.4 then  sumpingl(i, k) = 0 End If  Next k End If  Next j

V. ANALYSIS OF THE CONCLUSION  In Figure 1, the El to EIO columns of a row show the appraisal result of a teacher and the Number column shows the teacher's classification type. The char "#" means this appraisal item no problem, on the contrary, the greater value means the more serious problem of this appraisal item. It can be seen from Fig.1 that most of the 10 teaching appraisal items are unsatisfactory of the first kinds of teacher, and it is also the same of the 17th, the 18th and the 30th kinds of teacher. From the vertical view, the E6 and the E7 appraisal  items are dissatisfied. Similarly, the E3 and E4 appraisal items are also unsatisfactory [4].



VI. SUMMARIES  This paper discusses how to find the defects in teaching by using Association Rules. The data used in this paper are real and reliable. The conclusions generated by this algorithm can be used to reveal defects and also can be used as guidance for improving teaching quality [5].
