I.  INTRODUCTION Immune algorithm is the computer model which  combines with computer technology to solve practical problems, and it has got inspiration from biological system, so it is the combinatorial product of bio-immunology and computer science. In 1986, Farmal et al involved the concept of "Immune Algorithm" in one article called?The Immune System, Adaptation, and Machine Learning?. From then on, the study of immune algorithm has aroused the interest of more and more scholars in the international arena. In the twenty years, the results of these researches have been involved in data mining[1], network security[2], pattern recognition[3], combinatorial optimization[4] and so on. At present, the research of artificial immune algorithm is in full swing and still immature. There are still some questions to be deeper studied, such as the questions of early maturity and search efficiency. In this paper, we introduce the Metropolis criterion of simulated annealing mechanism based on immune algorithm, which accepts ill-conditioned by a certain probability, consequently, the improved algorithm is better to escape from local extremum, improve the speed of convergence speed and avoid degradation etc.

Association Rule Mining is an important branch of the research field in Data Mining, which is uesed to discover the related rules between different commodity(item) in the transaction database. These rules reflect behavior model of buying of customer, such as the impact of purchasing some merchandise. Since Agrawal et al firstly raised the issue of association rules mining in 1993[5], the study of this problem has gained considerable development in some aspects and proposed many mining algorithms. One of the most influential association rule mining algorithms is Apriori  algorithm which is mostly as the core of the rest of algorithm, just to take into improvement and expansion.

However, some of the existing algorithms still widely existe the questions of larger amount of calculation and lower efficiency of excavation etc, therefore, a fast and effective algorithm for association rules mining is urgently needed.

Based on the above problems we try to introduce the MIA into the association rules mining.



II. THE IMMUNE ALGORITHM BASED ON METROPOLIS CRITERION (MIA)  A. Metropolis criterion Metropolis criterion is an importance sampling method  proposed by Metropolis et al in 1953. In the simulated annealing algorithm the criterion of state changing from i to j is the corresponding transition probability, which can be expressed as:   ?1?  Where ? = f(i)-f(j), f(i) and f(j) are the values of  objective funcition in the state i and j; T is the temperature in the process of annealing, which is the control parameter;  Pt( ji ? ) determines whether or not to accept the  transition from the current solution i to new solution j. We generate a random number in range of [0 1] by using the  number generator, when the value of Pt( ji ? ) is larger  than the random number, the new state is important state and take the new state as the current state, or else give up the new state and accept the original state by a certain probability Pt. Then it iterative generates new state.

B. The structure of MIA operator In this paper we carry out some improvement for the  traditional immune operator, that is, introduce Metropolis criterion into the selection operation of immune algorithm.

The improved immune operator is made up of two steps, which are vaccination and Metropolis selection. The former is to improve the fitness of individual, the later is to prevent the degradation of group and to accelerate the speed of convergence. The specific description is as follows:  1)  Vaccination: Set up individual b ? Rn, b = (b1, ..., bn). Vaccinated to them means to amend some genes of the b according to the prior knowledge, so that individuals  ? ? ?  > ?  =? ? )()(,  )()(,1 )( / ifjfe  ifjf jip tt  2009 Third International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application  DOI 10.1109/IITA.2009.260   2009 Third International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application  DOI 10.1109/IITA.2009.260     could have the higher adaptation degree with the greater probability. These prior knowledge can be the probably value range of the optimal solution's some component, may also be certain restrictive relation between some component.

Moreover, the operation should meet the following conditions: if b is already the best individual, b transfer to b with probability 1; if b is the worst individual, that is, every gene of b with is different from the best individual, b transfer to b with probability 0. Let the Groups B = (b1, ..., bN), Vaccinated to B is a sort of operation that randomly selected N? = ?N individuals according to a certain proportion ?(0 ? ? ? 1). The vaccine is extracted from the priori knowledge of the problem, and it contains information and its accuracy that play an important role on the efficiency of the implementation of the algorithm.

2) Metropolis selection: That is, we test individual which was vaccinated. If the fitness of offspring is better than the generation of parent, it will enter into the next generation instead of the parent, which ensures the best individual of group to enter into the next generation; If the fitness of offspring is smaller than the generation of parent, which shows that the group has appeared  serious degradation in the genetic process, then this group enter into the next group by the probability Pt of the formula (1), that is, this can limited accept ill-conditioned while accepting the best individual, which ensures the diversity of group and avoids falling into the local extremum.

3) The flow chat of MIA    Figure 1.  Figure 1 the flow chat of MIA  4) The theoretical analysis and experimental verification of MIA  a) The theoretical analysis of MIA: Metropolis criterion can limited accept ill-conditioned, the probability of acceptance of the ill-conditioned slowly tends to zero with the temperature decreased, which can make the algorithm may jump from the local optimum and find the global optimum solution as far as possible. In the early period of algorithm, that is, the temperature of system is higher, it can accept the new solution algorithm of no improvement by the higher probability, and can effectively avoid to fall into a bad situation in this period; In the later period of algorithm, that is, the temperature of system is lower, it can accept the new solution algorithm of no improvement by the lower probability, and can ensure the convergence of the algorithm while reducing the convergent time of algorithm.

Therefore, through the theoretical analysis we can know theimproved algorithm can further solve the degenerate phenomenon of the current algorithm and improve the speed of convergence after introducing the Metropolis criterion.

b) The experimental verification of MIA?In this paper, we carry out simulation test by using a traditional test function, the function is as follow:  2)10sin( += xxy ?   x ?[-1 2]        ?2? This is a multi-peak one-dimensional variable function  which is commonly used in the detection of evolutionary algorithm. In a given range, it has a number of local extremum, the maximum value f(1.85)=3.85.

The simulations of IA and MIA are shown separately as follows Figure 2:    Figure 2 The figure of simulation  From the figure 2, we can see that the convergence speed of MIA is more quickly than IA; The average optimal value of MIA is 3.8468 while the average optimal value of IA is 3.8298; Compared with IA, the running state of MIA is more stable.

Therefor, through the above we can know that the overall performance of MIA is better than IA.



III. THE ASSOCIATION RULES MINING BASED ON MIA  A. The design of coding transaction database is mainly used for the discovery of  association rules, and some datas(that is, the values of attributes be interested by users) are the specific object application. Therefor, in this paper we adopt the method of real-coded. The real number is used to express the data (that is, antigen) which is disposed in data mining, and the antibody X is made up of a set of real numbers  . Suppose that the fact table is composed of age, sex,income, occuption, category of commodity(where the age has five values, the sex has two values, the income has ten values, the occuption has twenty values, the category of commodity has thirty values), the range of coding is from 0 0 0 0 0 to 5 2 10 20 30, where the attributes not chosed are expressed by the number 0.

B. The structure of the fitness function The fitness is the sole basis of selection operation of  immune algorithm, and it is the symbol of immune algorithm which is directed search different from random blind search.

The fitness function react as bridge between optimization problem and immune algorithm, therefore, the design of the fitness function directly affects the performance and efficiency of immune algorithm when it solves practical problems. MIA must needs in accordance with the value of the fitness function when searching. Therefore, we must solve assessment question of individual in order to  assess the advantage and disadvantage of each individual.

In the association rules mining, the rules discovered must meet some certain Conf(x) and Supp(x), that is, Conf(x) and Supp(x) are the two important parameters of association rules. Therefor, in this paper we take the fitness function as follows ?3?:    Where Ws+Wc=1, Ws?0, Wc?0, Suppmin is the threshold of support, Confmin is the threshold of confidence.

C. The algorithm steps of association rules mining based on MIA ? Randomly generate value of each attribute, select  this value by the probability i?  which takes zero, take the others values of attribute by the probability ?1- i? ?, its range is an integer which is randomly chosed from one to the number of this attribute.

When the corresponding selected probability i?  of some attribute is zero, this attribute must exist in association rules mining, and if i?  is not zero, then the corresponding attribute does not necessarily exist in association rules mining. Choose n original antibodies by circulation, the order of each attribute of these antibodies is the same while ensuring that  each attribute meets the condition of the threshold of support. Thereout, the original group of antibody A0 is formed.

?  Calculate the value of fitness of each antibody according to the formula (3).

? If the current group has included the optimal solution (that is, the antibodies which have been got meet the minimum support and minimum confidence at the same time), the algorithm output the antibodies, revert them to the original values of attribute and interpret rules, but still restore them in the group. If the iteration numbers meet the condition of stop, the algorithm would stop running and output the result; Otherwise continue.

? Extract the vaccines H based on the best antibodies which are generated.

? Carry out mutation operation for the current group of father Ak, extract antibody from Ak by the probability of Pm, carry out mutation of real number for one or more attributes, randomly make them to others values of attributes by some probability; Carry out crossover operation for the current group Bk, in this paper we adopt discrete recombination rule. Delete the antibodies which do not meet the condition of support.

? Carry out the operation of vaccination based on the best vaccines which are extracted.

? Take the criterion of Metropolis selection for the antibodies which have been inoculated, if the fitness of offspring is better than the parent generation, it will enter into the next generation instead of the parent. If the fitness of offspring is smaller than the parent generation, this group enter into the next group by the probability Pt of the formula (1), then transferre to step two.



IV. THE RESULTS OF EXPERIMENT In this paper, according to one thousand record datas of  transaction of customers which are extracted in e-shopping, we conduct the corresponding mining of association rules, and discover the habit of customers who used to buy goods by using MIA.

For some basic informations of customers and the names of commodities (that is, the fields of database), such as the customer's age, occupation, income and the category of the electronic commodity and so on, we express them by means of the real-code. Some values of the attributes  are encoded in the following table 1.

In the experiment the parameters of algorithm are: the initial group is 50, the numbers of iteration are 100 times, the mutation probability Pm is 0.3, the crossover probability Pc is 0.5; The parameter Tk in the Metropolis selection meets the formula: Tk= ln[T0/k+ 1](where T0=100), the threshold of confidence is 70%, the threshold of support is 4%. The evaluation criterion of excavation is category of commodity.

Income of year?30K-39K? ? category of commodity?computer?[support=5%? confidence=80%]  ??  In all, we can excavate eighteen rules, and this algorithm cost 10.204 seconds.

From the result of the experiment we can see that this algorithm could effectively find most frequent sets and generate the association rules. These rules meet the actual conditions, thus show that this algorithm is effective and feasible when used in the association rules mining.



V. CONCLUSION In this paper we propose an improved immune  algorithm(that is, MIA) through combining with the  character of the simulated annealing mechanism. Compared with traditional IA, through theoretical analysis and the result of experiment, MIA can further solve the degenerate phenomenon of the current algorithm and improve the speed of convergence after introducing the Metropolis criterion; Then we try to use this algorithm to excavate association rules, propose a new algorithm of association rule mining.

Through theoretical analysis and experimental results we can verify that the algorithm is feasible and effective.
