AgriMine: A tool for Mining Agricultural Problems

Abstract- This paper presents AgriMine which is a tool that was developed in order to mine agricultural problems accumulated in  a textual database over a period of 5 years. The problems, which are accompanied by their solutions, offer a wealth of knowledge  that can be used by decision makers, researchers, and farmers  alike. However, this wealth of knowledge cannot be unlocked  without first representing these problems in a structured format,  and secondly applying algorithms that can summarize and  analyze this information. Towards the achievement of the first  goal, a multi-faceted object extraction methodology is presented,  and for the achievement of the second, association rules are employed. As a proof of concept, the tool was applied of a set of  weed problems. The presented methodology can be modified to  work with any help and support textual database where both  problems and their solutions are present.

I. INTRODUCTION  The advent of the Web has facilitated the communication between organizations and corporations and their clients as many of those now offer web based help and support services whereby users can enter problems they face in free text format and have an expert or specialist respond to them also in free text. The accumulation of such problems and their solutions offers a wealth of knowledge that can only be unlocked by analyzing these texts and extracting useful information from them. This paper presents the initial approach and results of doing just that on a subset of problems extracted from VERCON's "Farmers problems" database [1].

VERCON(the Virtual Extension and Research Communication Network) was established in order to improve the communication between research institutions and extension personal for the benefit of growers and agrarian businesses.

One of VERVON's main components is the "Farmers Problems Database" which was created in order to address farmer problems for which there are no officially published   recommendations. The idea of this component is a simple one: through a web based interface, a user can input hislher problem using some basic meta-data descriptors that specifY hislher location, the nature of the problem being entered, and the crop for which this problem has been encountered. Slhe would then go on to enter a free text description of the problem listing all concerns and additional important parameters within the text itself. The problem would then be forwarded to a researcher who would reply in free text telling the farmer what slhe should do to address the problem. The idea was that someone with a problem can search this resource for a similar problem to hislhers and readily find a response to hislher concern. If such a solution could not be found, then the person can post their problem, have it answered by an expert, and avail the complaint and its solution to other users of the system. Over a period of five years, this valuable resource has grown to contain 10,000+ problems and their solutions all stored in a textual database.

The goal of this work is to create a tool capable of taking in these problems and presenting a summary of expert opinions on these in a way that can help a reader spot and address any inconsistencies or pin-point desired information depending on who the reader is. The reader of this report can be a decision maker interested in knowing what the widespread problems are in rural areas, and whether recommendations given to complainers agree or contradict with approved recommendations. The reader of this report, may also be a scientist or a researcher interested in discovering unknown relationships among a set of certain features. A farmer or a grower may also use this tool in-order to determine the most likely course of action that should be taken when faced with a particular problem. To develop such a tool, information extraction/opinion mining techniques were employed in conjunction with natural language processing and data mining techniques.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 elaborates on the extraction problem by defining it within the context of the presented work, section 3 presents related work, section 4 describes the developed tool, section 5 shows how the tool was deployed, and finally section 6 concludes this paper and lists areas of future work.



II. THE EXTRACTION PROBLEM: DEFINED  By examining a sample of complaints and solutions entered into the VERCON problem database, it was found that a single complaint may contain 1 or more primary complaint objects (explicitly or implicitly specified) often supported with additional complaint features. An implicitly implied complaint object, is one that is not explicitly entered by the complainer, and which is usually deduced and stated by the expert answering the user's query. For example, a user entering a complaint about a disease may not even know what the disease is and may simply describe it in terms of symptoms occurring on various plant parts. An expert would take this, and in most cases will provide the disease name as well as advice as to how to address this problem. The disease in this case, is the primary object of the complaint, and the symptoms entered by the user are the supporting features. Each of these features typically describe a specific plant part, and the extraction process has to differentiate between these. An expert often describes alternative solutions rather than just one. So extracting each of these without confusing features associated with each, is one of the extraction challenges. A close look at various entered problems and their solutions revealed that farmers and experts alike, enter problems and solutions with varying degrees of details.

The following is an example of typical complaint retrieved from the textual database of VERCON. The complaint has been translated from Arabic to English:  There are spots on the leaves and on the spikes which have a cotton like texture and which turn to grey in some areas within the planted 25 feddan land.

The main object of the complaint (the disease) is not apparent in this text, but we need to identity that the complaint objects are the leaf and spike, and that the complaint features describing each are the spots that have cotton like texture and a color that is changing to grey. More formally, the attributes of the spot feature will be as follows: color = grey, and texture = cotton like So if we find the same features in another complaint then we can predict that these two complaints are similar. However, in real life it is rare to have two problems with the exact same features. For example, the following is another similar complaint that has a different wording and features:  There are white, non-uniform spots with cotton like texture on the lower surface of plant leaves.

Here the complaint object is the leaf, and the feature associated with this descriptor is spots which have the following attributes: (color = white, texture = cotton like, location = lower surface, and distribution= non-uniform). The two problems partially match in terms of problem features as   they both have spots on the leaves characterized by the a cotton like texture. However, this information on its own is not enough to deduce that the two problems are actually similar.

Looking at the solutions for both problems, we find that the solution is the same. We also find that the experts responding to the query name "Powdery mildew" as the cause of the complaint thus we can consider this disease as the main object of the complaint. So the solution can actually help in the production of generalization rules that can determine problems that are similar to each other. These rule can then be used for finding a solution to a previously unseen complaint by matching this complaint to those previously solved ones which are similar to it. The result displayed to the user with the input complaint can be a "standard solution" which was previously stored for all similar problems, or simply a list of all solutions that have previously been offered to stored similar complaints.



III. RELATED WORK  This work aims at analyzing growers' complaints to come up with causes and features of these complaints and their solutions. This area of research has some similarity with opinion mining which has appeared recently to assist customers to sort through product reviews before making a purchase as it has become very difficult to go through the huge amount of reviews available on the web. The growers' complaints represent negative opinions about agricultural objects such as soil, water, climate, plant and others. We can make an analogy between these multiple objects hidden in the complaints and opinion mining of product reviews.

Most opinion mining systems rely on identitying the product features and their possible associated opinions. For example, the feature "display" is associated with opinion words like "bright", "dark", and "clear" for a mobile phone product (2]. In (3], Hu and Liu proposed an automatic way to extract product features from English product reviews using Association Rule Mining (4]. In (5] Berland and Charniak proposed a method to extract 'part-of' features, using possessive constructions and prepositional phrases from news corpora. In (6], Yi et al extract both 'part-of' and 'attribute-of' features from online reviews. In (7], Popescu and Etzioni, extract explicit features for the given product class from parsed review data, and use PM! assessment to evaluate each candidate feature. (8] present a method based on identitying all domain-related phrases and then discriminating them into features and products.

Extracting opinion words that describe a certain feature is a challenging problem and so is the identification of product features. The opinion word dictionary is typically generated by collecting adjectives expressing positive or negative opinion and then automatically searching for synonyms and antonyms using a semantic lexicon such as WordNet (9] (3]. In (10], Liu et aI, propose an Opinion Observer from which users can clearly see the advantage and weakness of each product in the minds of other consumers. Their work has boosted the development of new techniques and systems for opinion analysis.

The work makes use of an ontology to discover these multiple objects and to identity their features.



IV. DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVELOPED TOOL  As stated before, the goal of this work is to create a tool capable of producing a summary of expert opinions on various problems and in different ways depending on who the user is.

For this to happen, problems in the "Farmers problems database" must first be stored in a structured format. This takes  place t?r0ugh an object extractor. The object extraction process IS carned out once on all problems in the database, and again, whenever new problems and their solutions are entered into the textual database. After the problems are stored in the database association rules [4] can be applied in order to extract meaningful patterns and relations from the agricultural data stored in the structured database. Association rules offer a powerful technique whereby analysts and researchers can uncover hidden patterns within large data sets. To facilitate this process, a web based interface is used to allow an expert user to select features that s/he want to apply association rules on. The tool allows the user to enter the minimum required support for the extrapolation of a meaningful relation where support is defined as the probability that a certain problem and its soluti?n contain a given feature or set of features. If a support value IS not reached in any given relation, then chances are that this relation is not a significant one. Examining the results can allow a developer to select important relationships, label them, and avail them to other users of the tool.

Figure 1 presents the tool's architecture. So the main components of this tool are the feature extractor, the association rule engine, and the web based interface. Each of these is described briefly in the following subsections:   A. The object extractor  The object extractor takes in as input problems and their solutions and generates as output, a structured representation of each in the form of feature tuples that can be stored in a database. To carry out this task, the extractor makes use of an Agricultural ontology as well of extraction templates coupled with extraction rules. In the textual complaints database, metadata is provided to classity problems according to the issues they deal with. For example, typical classifications include "weeds", "diseases", "pests", "fertilization", and "irrigation". For each of these categories, a hand crafted extraction template is created. A filled in template would represent a problem and its solution. So basically, a template specifies objects that can be extracted from either and their type. A meta-tag associated with each problem and its solution aids the extractor to determine which templates and rules it should apply. Objects to extract are defined as one of five possible types: Named entities, time based entities numbers  percentages and rates. In this work, the use of an ?ntology i? Instrumental. An ontology plays a major role in the identification of agricultural objects which are the named entities of concern in this work. The ontology not only includes specific objects, but also their associated features and the possible attributes for these. For the extraction task all ontology entries are read, stemmed, and stored in  ' their  stemmed form. Stemming of Arabic is far more complicated than that of English because of its inflected nature. Since the accuracy of this step can affect the overall accuracy of the system, the stemmer presented in [11] and which emphasizes accuracy, was used to carry out this task. When parsing an input complaint (which is actually the complaints and its solution) , the complaint's text is scanned word by word. A search for each stemmed version of word is then carried out within the stemmed version of the ontology. If a match is found, then the object associated with the word, is said to have been identified. For example, when the word "??" is    encountered and searched within the ontology, it will be found to be associated with the 'Weed' object. The object and the location where it was encountered (word number and sentence number) are both stored. This is important as we define a context window for the identification of related features. For example, a pesticide has three related features which are: concentration (percentage), time _ oC Application( time based entity), rate_oCapplication(rate). So, if a pattern matching any of these features is detected in the object's vicinity, then its associated feature can be extracted and the value of its attribute set.

A number is easy to extract as it usually follows a known number format. Time based entities can appear as a number followed by a unit of time as for example: I day, 2 months, 3 years, or they can simply be represented in pure text as for example: after a week. A percentage entity is usually a number followed by a percentage mark and is often a property of a named entity. A rate refers to an amount of one thing considered in relation to a unit of another thing (Kilos per Feddan, dollars/hour, etc). Regular expressions are employed for the extraction of these three entities.

When defining an extraction template, a user can indicate that certain objects are context objects, and can define context windows for the extraction of their associated features. Other objects which are features for this object are associated with this object through a context field which lists this object as their context. A user can also specify a certain object as the main object of a complaint (MaC) and another as a main object of a solution (MaS). During the extraction process, a tuple is for each solution and its complaint is created. This tuple, is replicated each time a new MaC or MaS is encountered.

B. The structured complaint and solution database  The structured complaint and solution database is a relational database that is used to store information about objects that were extracted by the object extractor. Each class of problems (eg .. Weeds, Fertilization, etc) has its own table where tuples generated by the object extractor are stored. Each tuple in the database represents a complete problem and its solution. Since the design of a tuple takes into consideration all features that may be part of a problem and its solution, a tuple is always only partially filled.

C. The association rule engine  The association rule engine takes as input, a problem's class, crop, and features of interest, and retrieves all tuples related to these from the structured database (frequent item sets ) . The apriorio association rule algorithm is then applied to those in order to calculate the probable co? occurrence of features within the frequent itemsets using the support and confidence metrics. As stated before, support reflects how frequently features in an itemset occur together, while confidence is the conditional probability of the feature that represents "the then part an association rule" given the rest of the features which represent the "if part of the rule". These results are then returned to the component that originally called   the engine (the web based user interface m our implementation).

D. The web based user interface  The web based user interface is the means by which a user can invoke and make use of the developed tool. It allows the user to select the class of problems s/he is interested in as well as the specific crop for which various reports are to be generated. Once these two factors have been selected, the user can either choose to view patterns and relations that were previously defined by a developer/an expert user, or if this is a more advanced user s/he can create his/her own report by selecting features s/he is interested in as well as a threshold value. In case the user wants the former type of report, s/he can choose between two kinds: brief or detailed. Brief reports make use of predefined support thresholds, while detailed reports display all possible relationships even if these have a very low support. In both cases, both the support and confidence values are displayed to the user.

The user interface also takes in as input a list of any prohibited material such as prohibited pesticides or herbicides, and whenever any of these appear in a relation, it highlights them in red. Another list that can be input to user interface is a list of weeds, diseases, pests, or any kind of a problem for which there is a published recommendation. Problems derived from the problem database that do not match with any entries in this list, are highlighted in orange so as to bring the attention of decision makers to the fact that there might be a problem that warrants their attention.



V. DEPLOYMENT  For the purpose of experimentation, a subset of the problems and their solutions were selected from VERCON's textual database for use as a proof of concept as to the usefulness of the tool. These were problems related to "Weeds." The reason this specific class of problems was selected is due to the fact that it represents the biggest class of problems in the textual database. After applying association rules to these, the following set of useful patterns and relationships were identified:  1. The distribution of weeds over governorates.

2. The distribution pattern of weed problems among  planting methods.

3. The most commonly used herbicides and their  occurrence frequency.

4. Relationship between a certain weed and a  specific herbicide.

5. Relationship between the control method and  control time.

6. Relationship between herbicides and control  times.

7. Breakdown of weeds into (wide and narrow  weeds) and their occurrence frequency.

A user can have access to these relationships directly using the interface displayed in figure 2. Alternatively, a user may choose to experiment with other types of relations that s/he can define through another interface. Figure 3, exemplifies a sample of a brief report which represents the relationship between a certain weed and a specific herbicide (herbicide properties such as concentration and rate are listed as well). For a grower, this report can inform himlher of what they should probably use if s/he encounters any of the listed weeds and for a decision maker this can serve to verify recommendations by the ministry. The distribution of weeds over governorates can inform decision makers and researchers alike, of where to expect infestations of certain weeds across the country. Pronounced infestations in certain governorates may warrant specific actions that might lead to the reduction of these infestations. Using this system on real problems has revealed that farmers reported three weeds for which there were no published recommendations. It has also shown, that experts have recommended four herbicides that have been prohibited by the government.
