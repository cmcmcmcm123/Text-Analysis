I. INTRODUCTION  Individual?s protection is very important both in physical  or mental form when living in a risk environment. Insurance  is one of the individual protections that cover a person from  problem such as accident, blaze, critical diseases or death.

Insurance company plays a critical role in providing  competitive and flexible insurance product that covers  customer requirements. Currently with a number of  insurance products in the market and in order to be able to  compete with other competitors, insurance company needs a  wise and proper business strategy. Knowledge in identifying  potential customers whom will give positive response to the  product being offered is crucial and will benefit the  company. The knowledge may in terms of a specific pattern  on customer characteristics that always buy on certain  insurance products. This knowledge can improve the  company revenue resources if they use in the right way.

They may offer more friendly services to customers. The  quality of the decision can be improved and this will give a  positive impact to the company. To get knowledge and  quality information, data mining can be applied to the  insurance industry. This technique is widely used in various  domains such as medical, marketing, banking and science in  supplying useful and quality information.

In this study, one of the data mining techniques, the  associative classification approach will be used to find  interesting relationship and frequent pattern in insurance  data. An association rules mining is a well-known approach  in generating huge number of rules. The discovered rules  then will be transformed into the classification rules. The  generated rules can be used to assist the company in  expanding their business by offering more competitive  insurance products and reducing insurance cancellation rate.

Also, it can focus on the potential customers whom capable  of buying insurance and maintaining the insurance. This  brings profits to customers and the company. Therefore, this  technique offers a huge benefit to company insurance in  expanding their business segmentations. The insurance data  used in this study are obtained from an insurance company  in Malaysia and it contains 200,000 records with 74  attributes. These records contain customer data such as  name, age, race, religion, premium amount, policy status,  and address of the policy holders. There are often a huge  number of association rules discovered in a data mining  practice, making it difficult for users to identify those that  are of particular interest to them. Therefore, it is important  to remove insignificant rules and prune redundancy as well  as summarize, visualize and post-mine the discovered rules.

Moreover, the information obtained from traditional  association rules are very limited, so new forms of  association rules are needed to discover useful and  actionable knowledge.

This paper is organized into five sections. The related  work of associative classification model and insurance  domain will be discussed in section II. Section III and IV  present the main methodology of our associative  classification modeling and experiments. Finally, section V  concludes the work in this paper.



II. RELATED WORK  Associative classification is a data mining approach of  using association rules mining to construct a classification  model. This approach is commonly employed when there  are a vast amount of data and a lot of information need to be     discovered from the data. It also used when the actual class  of the data is uncertain to the researcher and post mining of  association may support the identification of appropriate  attributes. There are several techniques in associative  classification as discussed in [1] such as the Classification  based on Predictive Association Rules (CPAR),  Classification based on Multiple Association Rules  (CMAR), Multi Class classification based on Association  Rules (MCAR), and Multi Label Associative Classification  (MMAC). The main functions of these algorithms are  employing different rule discovery, rule ranking, rule  pruning, rule prediction and rule evaluation methods.

Recently, the data mining technology has been  supporting the statistical techniques in solving business  problem. In particular, data mining improves the existing  predictive models by investigating the new form of rules  that are more meaningful and interesting. The predictive  models that are able to predict the behavior and relationship  among data will strongly support the process of decision  making thus enhanced the quality of company?s strategic  planning and business intelligence [2]. The main challenge  in sustaining a business is to increase the number of new  customer and to fulfil various customer needs. Recently, the  term business intelligence used in business is commonly  associated with data mining. In business intelligence,  satisfying the customer needs is the main aim of a company.

Thus, a company needs to investigate and do research on  how to strategize their products in fulfilling these needs. In  insurance industry, companies are aggressively offering  various insurance products to attract customers.

Understanding the demographic and cutomer personal  profiles leads to a new view in setting and offering better  products. The policy holder interests in having more than  one insurance policies is higher than obtaining a single  policy only [2,3,4,5,6,7]. Therefore, it is good for a  company to plan for a new insurance product that support  various customer needs to make the customer financially  managable. Indirectly, the company gains more profits in  retaining the customer with that special policy product.

In this study, we propose a data mining approach called  associative classification to discover important association  and relationship within large amount of insurance dataset.

These data associations will be processed using the  classification-based association (CBA) technique [1] where  important knowledge model is obtained. The knowledge  model will be analyzed further and based on the developed  model, the strategic decision is proposed.



III. METHODOLOGY  The associative model development involves four  important steps: i) Data collection and preprocessing, ii)  Association Rules Mining (ARM), iii) Association Rules  Post-Mining, and iv) Associative Classification Model  Development.

A. Data Collection and Preprocessing  The insurance policy holders and products data are  collected from the Malaysian Insurance Company contains  about 200,000 records. The data consists of 74 attributes  about the insurances policy and policy holder profiles. There  are five types of insurance products offered such as  Dynamic Asia Capital Protected (DACP), Group Mortgage  Reducing Term Assurance (GMRTA), Hire Purchase  Reducing Term Assurance (HPRTA), Medic Freedom  (MEDF2) and FD Freedom (PEFD1). Table I shows the  attributes involves in each insurance product.

The purpose of data  cleaning stage is to handle the missing values and to smooth  out the noises. This is important to ensure a consistent  dataset for further mining processes. The continuous valued  attributes are transformed into categorical values and  reduced to limited categories to ensure the efficiency of the  mining process. The main challenge in preprocessing the  data was to perform a data reduction process where several  identified attributes have to be removed. These attributes  were the redundant attributes, key attributes and attributes  with low data distribution. During the data reduction  process, many redundant attributes have been identified and  removed from the data set. This leaved eight most relevant  attributes.

B. Association Rules Mining  In this study we propose an Apriori Algorithm for the  association rules mining to find association within the  insurance data. The apriori algorithm generates the frequent  patterns of the data prepared in the form of transactions  [10]. It generates rules and these rules will be further  processed in the post mining stage. Apriori algorithm  generally performs two important tasks; generation of  frequent pattern candidates and generation of rules [9].

The rules generated during this process can be measured  in terms of the confidence and support value measurement.

The support value measures how frequent an item occurs  and the confidence value measures the strength of the  generated rules. The minimum value of support (min_sup)  and confidence (min_conf) are predetermined to control the  quality and the amount of generated rules. Various threshold  values are suggested for both measures [10, 11, 12]. In this  study the initial min_sup was set to 10% and the initial  min_conf was set to 80%. Several different minimum  support and confidence values were used in the experiments  to ensure the generated rules represent many frequent cases  and attributes. The consistent values of min_conf and  min_sup indicated the obtained rules are consistent and  reliable.

The Apriori algorithm was run on the insurance dataset  based on individual product. The results from our initial  experiment indicated that the best initial min_support and  min_conf obtained were 10% and 80% respectively.

Therefore, these initial measures were used on the other  different products data. Table II shows the example of  association rules generated from the DACP insurance  product. Five sets of association rules from each product  were generated and the rules were further analyzed in the  next stage of the experiment.

Status=Inforce LA Gender=Female LA ENTRY AGE=A04 518 ==> LA Marital=Married 514    conf:(0.99)  C. Association Rules Post Mining  Association rules mining often discovers a huge number  of rules and it is difficult to interpret and to select the most  interesting rules. This situation such as rules redundancy  will always occurs. Therefore, it is important to remove  insignificant rules and prune redundancy as well as  summarize, visualize and post-mine the discovered rules.

The generated association rules are further analyzed to  identify the appropriate class attribute for associative  classification. Four post mining steps are adapted in this  study: i) removing the redundancy in association rules, ii)  summarization and generalization of association rules, iii)  clustering the association rules and iv) creating associative  classifier. The association rules mining are filtered by  identifying the redundant rules where some rules can be  subsumed by other rules. The summarization and  generalization of rules involves searching for rules that  satisfy certain minimum confidence. In this study, the  minimum confidence is determined by simulating series of  confidence values to find one suitable values to be the  threshold confidence. This work is tedious and time  consuming. Finally, the frequency of the attributes at the  antecedent of the rules is computed and the potential class  attribute with the highest frequency will be considered as  the class attribute. In this study, the insurance product name  is focused to be the potential class and therefore the  associative classifier was obtained using this attribute.

D. Associative Classification Model Development  Association rules mining have shown interesting  findings in discovering interesting rules in data. Recently,  the association rules have been actively used for effective  classification. This is due to their corresponding  associations that have an interesting relationship between  attribute condition and class attribute. In this study, we used  the classification-based association (CBA) approach that  uses an iterative approach to frequent itemset mining [1,9].

In general CBA was empirically found to be more accurate  than C4.5 on a good number of dataset [9].

We enhance the CBA by introducing a heuristic to  construct the classifier with the following steps:  Step 1: Organize rules in decreasing precedence based on  confidence and support.

Step 2: If a set of rules has the same antecedent, then the  rules with highest confidence   is selected to  represent the set.

Step  3: Classify the test data using the first rule method.

Step 4: Classify the test data on correctly classified and  uncertainly classified.

Step 5: Verification of uncertainly classified rules by expert.

Step 6: Construct the knowledge model based on classified  and the verified uncertainly classified rules.



IV. EXPERIMENTS  A. Experimental Setup  In this study, we used datasets from five types of  insurance product: Dynamic Asia Capital Protected (DACP-  4564 records), Group Mortgage Reducing Term Assurance  (GMRTA-29854 records), Hire Purchase Reducing Term  Assurance (HPRTA-8729 records), Medic Freedom  (MEDF2-5922 records) and FD Freedom (PEFD1-2444  records). The initial threshold values of min_sup and  min_conf of every product were determined from our initial  parameter settings that were 10% for min_sup and 80% for  min_conf. However, various parameter settings were still  being used to ensure the stability of the selected parameters.

Various sizes of rules were obtained from these parameters  settings. The association rules mining towards the five  insurance product has produced many rules with various  confidence values and the combination of items. The total of  1818 rules were generated for the DACP product, 1044  rules for GMRT product, 2409 for the HPRTA product,  2252 with MEDF2 product and 628 rules for PEDF1  product. For each generation of association rules, the  interesting and strong rules were determined for  summarization and generalization of association rules. The  strong rules are obtained by determining the difference  between the confidence value of the rules and the minimum  confidence value.

The strong and interesting rules (that obtained after the  post mining stage) are defined as the rules that have  confidence ranges between 80% to 100%. In this study we  obtained 14 rules from DACP, 13 rules from GMRTA, 11  rules from HPRTA, 11 rules from MEDF2, and 9 rules from  PSFDI insurance products. Later, we filtered again all the  rules together and obtained three interesting rules from each  product. Therefore for the classification model, we obtained  15 association rules. Table III depicted the association rules  generated for insurance product profile data. The next  section will discuss how the associative model is  constructed from these association rules.

B. Results  We used the generated rules for testing the accuracy of  the associative classification rules. The testing is conducted  by reconstructing the rules. In the rules reconstruction, the  consequent part of the rule is the product class and the  existing consequent becomes the antecedent. All rules were  used to test the unseen cases and the classification accuracy  was recorded. The total of one hundred test data was taken  from all products classes where 20 data from each class  were selected. These data were the unseen examples that not  been used for mining. A simple voting procedure was used  for classification. The experimental results were noted by  the percentage of correct classification and uncertain  classification.

The uncertain classification indicates that the records are  uncertainly classified by having more than one product  class. In this case the uncertain classified records were  further analyzed to verify whether these records could also  be classified with other product class. If the verification is  true then, the consequence part of the rules is added with the  selection of two or more products. In this study, the  experimental results obtained 58% correctly classified  records and 42% uncertain classified records. The rules that  contributed to the uncertain classified records were then  investigated by the insurance experts and are verified  whether it is possible to offer more than one product with  the same cases. Therefore, the associative classification  rules obtained from this study is showed in Table IV. The  insurance experts verified that the generated rules indicated  that the company could offer a combination of products or  an alternative product to the potential customers. For  example, the insurance company can offer either product  DACP or GMRTA if the applicant fulfils the condition in  R1.

V. CONCLUSION  In this paper, we proposed an associative classification  approach to develop a knowledge model for insurance  product selection decision. We enhance the CBA algorithm  by introducing a heuristic in processing the extracted rules.

Two types of rules are observed i.e. rules obtained from the  correctly classified data and rules constructed from the  uncertain classified data. The uncertain classified rules are  constructed by considering the decision made by the  classification rules and by the original data decision. Policy  product expert verified these rules and the rules with  alternative decision are obtained. The knowledge model  obtained in this study is yet to be employed in the full  working system.

To conclude in business term, the insurance company  can offer more than one different plans in one policy or a  clustered insurance policy. For example, customer can have  both life and car insurance in a single policy. This will give  the value added to insurance product as well as the company  sustainability. The product will be more competitive and  flexible to the customers.
