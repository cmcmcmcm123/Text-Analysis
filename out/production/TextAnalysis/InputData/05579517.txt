I. INTRODUCTION  After 20 years of rapid economic development, China's car market has entered a phase characterized by civilian con? sumption, a car economic model which treat the car service and road transport activities as center has walked into a ma? ture track, step by step, and become an important component of economic development.

In this crowded traffic situation, it is urgently required to develop a net-work and information-oriented vehicle and road traffic information management system, besides plan? ning capital urban structure rationally, in order to improve public services management platform and to provide quick, reliable messaging services.

For the Network bottlenecks and latency time issues which existed during the data transmission process in the city driving service system, this paper introduces a new data min? ing algorithm which optimizes the scheduling model and improves the system data transmission capabilities, based on historical experience.

The experiment data in this paper results from historical traffic records in Shanghai World Expo.

U. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL ASSOCIATION RULES IN DATA MINING  A. Multi-dimensional association rules  Currently, one-dimensional association rule mining algo? rithm is mainly used in mining Boolean property database, which is not suitable to data transfer problem in the urban driving service system. Therefore, this paper proposes multi? dimensional association rules mining algorithm on traffic flow.

Cheng Yang Computer Engineering and Science College  Shanghai University Shanghai, China  lyyc5 8@126.com  Multi-dimensional association rule mmmg algorithm transforms the data into the n-dimensional feedback system expressed by n-element. These vehicle data comes from every data base and is sent to main base station. Through integrating these data, get an edited multi-dimensional data? base system which takes the perspective of the vehicle? oriented.

B. Vehicle orientation prediction rules  Firstly, data analysis is needed from each vehicle record.

Table I is formulated from a single transmission of the base station.

TABLE I. VEHICLE INFORMATION RECORD  Number Time Vehicle Vehicle type direction:outlin  N T X Oil  Next, select the vehicle-oriented module based on time, space, vehicles. Furthermore, release the priority scheduling scheme based on this three-dimensional structure, which called vehicle orientation prediction algorithm, characterized for vehicle's time and spatial data.



III. VEHICLE ORIENTATION PREDICTION ALGORITHM  Vehicle orientation prediction algorithm is as shown in Fig. 1.

Input: passing vehicle history records to database 0, col? lection of all attributes set to X, minimum support set to min sup, minimum confidence set to min conf, collection of user  concerned attributes set to P,P ? X.

Output: multi-dimensional frequent items between P.

Variable Description: Indiv(P) is the equivalence relation  constructed by P. Thus, after getting equivalence relation on P attributes by calculation, 0 can be divided into several equivalence classes, this division is described by D/Indiv(P).

Di describes the i-th subset in D/Indiv(P) equivalence class, {P: P(Di)} expresses P attribute values of any object in Di.

Step 1: take vehicle records into the form of Boolean in? formation system, initialize L into null set.

Step2: calculate equivalence class D/Indiv(P) on P attribute value of D.

For each sub-class of Di in D/Indiv (P), calculate Card (Di). If Card (Di) :::: min sup, then set Card (Di) into set K, K = K U { P:P(Di)}.

Figure 1 .  Vehicle orientation prediction algorithm  Step3: for each item sets in the set K, generate all non? empty subset of set K, then compute confidence's value of s=> (k-s); if confidence ? min conf, take P into multi? dimensional frequent item sets.



IV. PREDICTION ALGORITHM PROCESSES  The part of the Passing Vehicle Record from the Expo database is explained in Table II.

In order to obtain priority rules on the deployment of network transmission, take date, time, base station, three? dimensional into consideration, and then set min sup=0.3,  min conf=75%, From table II, get that: X={XI, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7}.

Make P= {X2, X5, X7}, means the relationship be? tween the base station and traffic flow.

Firstly, take a pre? treatment process for time ,divide one day as forenoon 6:00 ?  9:59, noon 1O:00?13:59, afternoon 14:00?17:59, nightfall l8:00?2l:59, midnight 22:00?5:59 for time division.

Second, because of the data distribution, it is difficult to find strong association rules in the most detail level data.

Thus, a concept is presented that means Regional division of the Expo to solve this discrete problem.

According to the World Expo exhibition, theme building, piping, etc, which have been shaping the regional settings, the whole Expo area is divided into A, B, C, D and E five areas. Among them, the pipe (network connection) distribu? tion is also in accordance with the five areas of construction design. So through their region, determine their membership of a particular area. Thus, needn't care about any particular moment, dozens of base stations in the busy state and just predict the flow of vehicles in a regional section. The results which are converted twice are shown in Table III.

Set the support of the frequent item sets as 3, after poly? merization, recalculate the equivalence classes of P. At this point, Dlindiv(X2X5X7(Il =1? obtains two equivalence classes, one contains four data elements {xl, x2, x5, x7}, and the other only has a single data element {x8}; also, can ob? tain D/lndiv(X2X5X7(I2=1? as {x3}, DI In? div(X2X5X7(I3=I? is {x4}, D/Indiv(X2X5X7(I4=1? as {x6}, DI Indiv(X2X5X7(I5=1?is null. It can clearly be seen that the I {xl,x2,x5,x7} I =4 In DI In? div(X2X5X7(II=I?={ {xl, x2,x5,x7},{x8}} satisfy the min? imum support. Thus, only this rule { Monday, D District, forenoon } meets the conditions of three-dimensional fre? quent item sets. And this means that the cars which go through D section areas are more frequently.

Thus, get following rules: I) Monday, D District -> am 80%; 2) Monday morning -> D District 80%; 3) D area in the morning -> Monday, 100%; 4) Monday -> the morning, D District 50%.

By the min conf = 75%, get three strong rules. Among  this, the issues we concerned that the relationship between time and base station are related to the information in the above rules: vehicle driving record in Monday morning, 80% came from D region segment. Thus, these rules are we need that its ability to dig out the three-dimensional relation? ship among date, time and base station.

By example analysis and processing, multi-dimensional frequent items algorithm which is applied for the Expo ve? hicle platform can tum multi-dimensional association rule mining into equivalence classes seeking for multiple attributes and tum user's different requirements into the combination of these attributes. And the multi-dimensional frequent items produced by this algorithm only contains user concerned dimension, thus, it can be more productive to meet the users concerned.

The instance mainly explains data mining process and al? gorithms. The aim of the data mining is to realize traffic flow in all regions.

Thus, do not need to require the mlllimum confidence and only dig out the frequent sequence of A, B, C, D, E- this five propagation section. Then give the moment a transmis? sion priority from high to low.

The example describes this three-dimensional relation? ship among date, time and base station by use algorithm.

Then, these algorithms can also be used to calculate the flow of vehicle condition. At this point, we take that:  X= {Xl, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7} , P= {X2,  X5, X6, X7}.

For this four-dimensional relationship, still calculate by  use mining multi-dimensional above. Thus, can obtain rules like this from table III  Monday, D District, am -> D area (flow) 75%.

That means that 75% of the vehicles which go into D area also leave from D area on Monday morning, while the rest vehicles flow into the E area except for other areas. Thus, scheduling algorithms can be improved again and make fre? quency range of each areas more precisely.



V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  Because the scheduling module of the transmission sys? tem runs in the background, experimental data can't be ob? served in this design of system architecture. In order to ob? tain experimental data, two blocks of data are embodied in the window platform.

Before applying these rules above, first add a priority scheduling algorithm which considers the value of the task, the latest transmission frequency and average transfer time.

In the application of the rules above before the addition of a comprehensive consideration of task value, the latest transmission frequency and average transfer time of the task priority scheduling algorithm, task scheduling to improve the overall performance to improve the overall performance of scheduling.

In the actual interface, the real-time parameters recorded in the server-side are shown in Table IV, before using asso? ciation rules.

By 22ms transmission, observe the priority changes again which has shown in Table V.
