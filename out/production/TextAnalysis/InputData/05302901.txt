I.  INTRODUCTION Data Mining is the process of finding hidden patterns in a large data set. It can be defined   as the nontrivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from data .spatial data mining can be defined as a set of exploratory computational and statistical approaches for analyzing very large spatial and spatiotemporal data sets.

Data mining techniques are often grouped into categories that include clustering, categorization, summarization, rule- mining, and feature extraction[1].  All of these types of techniques are generally oriented towards identifying spatial or spatio-temporal patterns in geographic observations or measurements. Challenges in spatial data mining arises because traditional data mining deals with continues and discrete variables whereas spatial data is more complex and rich comprising of objects like points, lines and polygons.

Spatial Data Mining comprises of spatial attributes like distance, spatial autocorrelation and spatial predicates like overlap that are quite implicit as compared to tradition data mining where inputs are explicit [2].

Several methods has been developed to discover spatial association rules. These are statistical analysis, generalization techniques, extension of techniques from mining association rules based on market basket transaction data and collocation rules discovery techniques. Statistical techniques handles numerical data very well and there is rich set of algorithms developed using these techniques [3]. But they usually assume statistical independence of spatial data which proves to be unrealistic due to influence of neighboring regions. These techniques heavily depend on domain and statistical  knowledge [4]. Generalization techniques employ high level concepts. These concepts describe general relation ships between spatial and non-spatial data.

Extension of techniques for mining association rules in transaction-based databases to mining spatial association rules is another solution. A transaction is artificially created in some of these techniques so support, confidence, pruning from transaction-based algorithm can be applied to spatial databases.

As mentioned in previous section Statistical algorithms to discover spatial association rules is one of the methods. These methods heavily depend on numerical data and they make unrealistic assumption in case of spatial data [5]. Influence of neighboring regions is an example where it becomes very challenging for these methods. These methods also deals very poorly with symbolic names like Expensive(condo) <-> inside(condo, downtown)^area(condo,large).

Generalization techniques use high level concepts. These algorithms are used for non-spatial dominant generalization and spatial-dominant generalization. These methods can not deal with the rules reflecting structure of spatial objects and relationships which contain spatial predicates such as adjacent_to, inside, close_to etc [6].

Moreover, spatial data has a strong auto correlation wherein different spatial variables are correlated with other whereas traditional data mining focuses on independence of variables.

A concept lattice is generated automatically from a relation between two sets, objects and attributes The concept (or Galois) Lattice of a binary relation formalizes it as a concept system, dually ordered in "extension" / "intension".

All implications between conjunctions of properties holding in it are summarized by a canonical basis - all basis having the same cardinality [7]. Using these tools lattices have been used to analyze binary data since the early eighties. Some procedures address more the former direction (lattice drawing, gluing decomposition, sub-lattices...) while others the latter (canonical basis of implications and lattice's core, box decomposition, weighted lattices).

This paper proposes an algorithm about spatial association rule mining which is based on concept lattice. Then, conception lattice is used in mining spatial association rules by the way that used in attribute association rules. Hence, the     method of mining spatial association rules is reduced to the method of mining attribute association rules.



II. DEFINITION OF SPATIAL CONCEPT LATTICE Concept lattice, which is also named as Galois lattice, is a  relatively new approach to the mathematics normalization and representation of conceptual knowledge. A concept lattice (a concept hierarchy) can be represented graphically using line (or Hasse) diagrams. These structures are composed of nodes and links. Each node represents a concept with its associated intensional description. The links connecting nodes represent the sub-concept and super-concept relation among them. This relation indicates that the parent?s extension is a superset of each child?s intension. A node covers all of the instances covered by the union of its descendents, making the concept hierarchy a sub-graph of the partial ordering by generality.

More abstract or general nodes occur higher in the hierarchy, whereas more specific ones occur at lower levels [8]. Object concepts are named with the specific object that produces the concept while attribute concepts are labeled with the specific attribute that generates the concept. A diagram contains all the context information; an object has an attribute if and only if there is an upwards leading path from its object concept to this attribute concept (Figure 1 shows the diagram for the attribute concept).

information  status cancel  line documents format  lp subm  lpq nroff  lpstat remove  queue   display  lprm send  attributes objects  lpr  job  printer  request  cancel      First, we give some standard definitions of formal concept  analysis and some new definitions: Definition 1: The formal context is a triple ( , , )T O D R= ,  where O is a set of objects, D is a set of their attributes, and R is the binary relation between O and D. according to the inclusion relationships between extensions, there is a unique lattice structure lattice L, which defines natural groupings and relationships descriptions between the objects and their attributes in the context.  .

Corresponding, besides the set of descriptors (attributes), definition of spatial concept lattice is the same as that of concept lattice which is proposed by Wille. The set of descriptors (attributes) is defined as the set of spatial relations and other spatial attributes of objects in spatial concept lattice.

Spatial concept satisfies properties described as follow [9]: Each node of lattice L is a pair ( , )A B   as concept, A pair ( , )A B  is called an object oriented concept, Sets A, B are called the intension and extension of formal concept ( , )Y X respectively.

Definition 2: For a set A O?  of objects and a set B P? of properties we define: The set of properties common to the objects in A: { }A p P oRp for all A= ? |    ??                             (1) The set of objects which have all properties in B:  { }B o O oRp for all p B= ? |    ?                               (2) The couple of operators ( , ) is a Galois Connection.

The set of all concepts of a context ( , , )O D R together with the order relation  is always a complete lattice, called the concept lattice of ( ( , , )T O D R=  and denoted by ( , , )B O D R . The lattice structure imposes a partial order on concepts and any concept subset must have one greatest common sub-concept and one smallest common super- concept.



III. GENERALIZATION OF SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP A spatial association rule indicates certain relationship among a set of spatial and possibly non-spatial predicates. It describes the implication of one or a set of features in spatial databases.

Extension techniques for mining association rules in transaction-based databases is used for spatial association rule mining. A spatial association rule is in the form of ?X->Y? where X and Y are set of predicates and some of which are spatial ones. The predicates involved in spatial association rules may represent topological relationships between spatial objects such as disjoint, intersects, inside/outside, adjacent to, cover/covered by equal etc [10]. They may also be in form of spatial orientation or ordering such as left, right, north, east etc. They may contain some distance information such as close to, faraway etc. Many spatial association rules are expressed at a relatively high concept level. Support and confidence concepts from traditional data mining are applied to discover spatial association rules. Support indicates the probability of a patterns occurrence in set of spatial objects.

Confidence X->Y is the occurring probability of Y whenever X occurs. Minimum support and minimum confidence threshold levels are used to eliminate the patterns that are not supposed to be interesting. This also reduces the number of the candidates and speeds up pattern discovery process. A concept hierarchy defines a sequence of mappings from a set of low-level concepts to higher-level, more general concepts. Consider a concept hierarchy for the dimension location. City values for  Figure 1 the diagram for the attribute concept     location include some cities. Each city, however, can be mapped to the province or state to which it belongs. For example, Wuhan can be mapped to Hubei, and Changsha to Hunan. The provinces and states can in turn be mapped to the country to which they belong, such as China or the USA. These mappings form a concept hierarchy for the dimension location, mapping a set of low-level concepts (i.e., cities) to higher-level, more general concepts (i.e., countries). The concept hierarchy described above is illustrated in Figure 2.

Many concept hierarchies are implicit within the database schema. For example, suppose that the dimension location is described by the attributes number, street, city, province or state, zip-code, and country. These attributes are related by a total order, forming a concept hierarchy such as "street < city < province or state < country". Alternatively, the attributes of a dimension may be organized in a partial order, forming a lattice. An example of a partial order for the time dimension based on the attributes day, week, month, quarter, and year is "day < {month <quarter; week} < year".2 A concept hierarchy that is a total or partial order among attributes in a database schema is called a schema hierarchy. Concept hierarchies that are common to many applications may be predefined in the data mining system, such as the concept hierarchy for time.

Data mining systems should provide users with the flexibility to tailor predefined hierarchies according to their particular  needs. For example, users may like to define a fiscal year starting on April 1, or an academic year starting on September 1.

Based on attribute values and distances, we will identify the data mining context this can be identified with a concept hierarchy, or in our model a ?partition hierarchy?.  Concept hierarchies are commonly defined as a tree of mappings from a set of low-level concepts to more general concepts, such as "city" < "province or state" < "country". This section begins by introducing two constructs that are fundamental to the framework subsequently developed. Assume we are given a spatial dataset providing information about some geospatial phenomenon and structured according to a prescribed representation. This representation will possess both extent and granularity.



IV. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING ALGORITHM BASED ON SPATIAL CONCEPT LATTICE  Association Rule Mining aims at finding rules on the basis of their relevance.. Its basic idea is to create all rules of each node without redundancy and its primary gist is the number and form of the parent node. When the graph has set of spatial concept lattice is given, the spatial association rule mining algorithm can be divided into two steps: the first step is to acquire parent nodes of all lattice nodes; the second one is to create association rule using theorem 1~3.

Theorem1. If node '( , )H X X=  in the lattice has only one parent node '( , )M Y Y=  , then any rules? foreside created from H could only be a single descriptor, and for  ' '( )p X Y=  ?  there exists a rule '( )p X p=>  ?  without redundancy.

Proof: Suppose a rule created from node H is:  '1 2 1 2... ...n np p p X p p p=>  ? 1n >   and ' , 1, 2,...,ip Y i n?  =   Then for x Y? ? , the  rule '1 2 1 2... ...n np p p X p p p=>  ?  comes into existence.

So this rule should be created from parent node M.

If there is a descriptor ' '{ }, {1,2,....., }kp X Y k n?  ? ? in 1 2... np p p  , Then rule '1 2 1 2... ...n np p p X p p p=>  ?  is redundant relative to rule ' 'kp X Y?  ? Hence, any rules? foreside created from node H could only be  a single descriptor 'kp  , and for ' '{ }kp X Y? ?  ? , rule  'p X p=>  ?  is irredundant.

Theorem2. If node '( , )H X X=  in the lattice has parent nodes with the number of d ,which are  '1 1 1( , )M Y Y= ?  ' 2 2 2( , )M Y Y= ,? , ( , )d d dM Y Y= , then for any descriptor  Figure.2 A concept  hierarchy for the dimension location.

V. EXPERIMENTATIONS RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To examine the above algorithm, We test the execution time  with the increasing of records, and increase the number from 0 at first to 1000 gradually.

The algorithms were carried out on a laptop with an Intel Pentium IV 1GHz CPU and 512M main memory, running Microsoft WindowsXP. All programs were coded in Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. The experimental dataset consists of two kinds of data , a pwer transmission lines graph and then transformed into a talbe; The two attribute table of the power pole which respectively contain five attributes. An attribute has 2~10 attribute values after generalization. During the mining of the single layer spatial association rule, these two tables are connected into a dataset of six attributes. The minimum support of each data layer is 6%, and the minimum confidence is  75%.Figure3 shows the CPU-time of the experiments with iris data set when using Apriori algorithm and this method presented in this paper. Moreover, from the Figure.4, we can see that this approach based on Concept Lattice is quite effective in reducing memory. According to the experimental results, we can see that CPU-times decreases significantly when we use this algorithm based on Concept Lattice

VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we presented a new an algorithm about spatial association rule mining based on concept lattice. A concept hierarchy defines a sequence of mappings from a set of low-level concepts to higher-level, more general concepts is introduced, Moreover, we gave association rule mining algorithm to build the coverage of formal concepts and to create optimal item- sets from data records. The experimentation of the proposed method is done on a variety of data sets having different data formats (structured and unstructured). The proposed method is faster than Apriori.
