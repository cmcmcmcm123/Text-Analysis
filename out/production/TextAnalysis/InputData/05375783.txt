Exploring the Relationship between Parental Information Literacy and Regulating

Abstract?Internet is filled with opportunities for learning, communicating, and sharing information. It is a valuable  resource for children and adults alike. However, the online  world presents some underlying risks, especially for children.

Parents need to be aware of some of the potential problems  their children could encounter, and try to take adequate  measures to protect their children from injury. In this paper,  research tried to explore the relationship between parent?s  information literary, the confidence in child?s ability of self-  defense on the internet, and adequate measures to promote  child using the internet more effectively. Association rule, a  kind of data mining strategy, was the main tool to manipulate  the dataset.

I. Introduction  Over the past few years, a fast growing number of  households have added electronic games, home computers,  and the Internet to other technologies to consume children's  time [1]. Surveys of parents suggested that they bought  home computers and subscribed to Internet access to  provide educational opportunities for their children, and to  prepare them for the ?information-age? [2]. Although they  were increasingly concerned about the influence of the Web  on their children and expressed disappointment over their  children using the computer for activities such as playing  games and browsing the Internet to download lyrics of  popular songs and pictures of rock stars, they generally  considered time wasted on the computer preferable to time  wasted on TV, and even considered children without  computers to be at a disadvantage [3]. Nowadays,  multimedia and interactive live video technologies  innovates the argument of ?information-age?. While digital  content becomes more and more complicated and diverged  from normal educational purport or entertainment, parents  don?t regard home computer and Internet as only a toy  anymore. Now, they concern how to regulate the rules to  conduct children?s online behavior correctly.



II. Literature review    A. Information literacy  Nowadays, the manipulation of new operation system in  computer and peripheral seems to become more  complicated, graphic interface doesn?t substantively  decrease the perplexity of operation; it is actually  information literacy that should be the concern. Information  literacy is much more than knowing how to open a Web  browser and type a search term into Google. Information  literacy is the ability to recognize when information is  needed and to locate, evaluate, and use that information  effectively. Moreover, information literacy is not just a skill  required in college; there is ?a lifelong need for being  informed and up-to-date [4].?Information literacy includes  cognitive activities, such as acquiring, interpreting, and  evaluating the quality of information. It is enabled by  technical skills, such as using a computer to research,  organize, analyze, and communicate. Information literacy  also is increasingly important in the contemporary  environment of rapid technological change and proliferating  information resources. Because of the escalating complexity  of this environment, individuals are faced with diverse,  abundant information choices?in their academic studies, in  the workplace, and in their personal lives [5]. ?  B. Data mining  While addressing the relationships between parent?s  information literacy and children?s attitude of using  computer, some content of association between parents,  children and computer was worthy to explore more deeply.

Data mining is one kind of tool often used to express the  context of complicated structure. There are four basically  different styles of learning appear in data mining application,  they are classification learning, clustering, numeric  predication, and association learning. Association rules  identify collections of data attributes that are statistically  related in the underlying data. An association rule is of the  form X => Y where X and Y are disjoint conjunctions of  attribute-value pairs. The confidence of the rule is the  conditional probability of Y given X, Pr(Y|X), and the  support of the rule is the prior probability of X and Y, Pr(X  and Y). Here probability is taken to be the observed   DOI 10.1109/CIS.2009.161     frequency in the data set. The traditional association rule  mining problem can be described as follows. Given a  database of transactions, a minimal confidence threshold  and a minimal support threshold, find all association rules  whose confidence and support are above the corresponding  thresholds. Some researches have extended this traditional  framework to better fit new application domains, in  particular genetic analysis and electronic commerce.



III. Data and method  In this study, the dataset of UK Children Go Online  Project (UKCGO) [6] was applied on the analysis to  examine parents? strategies on monitoring child?s behavior  online. The UK Children Go Online Project conducted  between 2003 and 2005, this project surveyed parents of the  9?17 year olds children by a variety of detailed questions  focused on young people?s Internet access and use. This  study aims at three subjects. First, whether or how parents  understand the intention and content of children?s  manipulation on the internet? Second, how do parent keep  with their children while they are on the internet? Third, is  there any activity which is not permitted while children on  the internet? The deviation of the strategies to there four  subjects depends on the different level of information  literacy which the parents have. The research of this paper  will focus on exploring the relationship between information  literacy and these three subjects (Table 1).

Weka , a system developed at the University of Waikato  in New Zealand, applies to this research, is a collection of  machine learning algorithms for solving real-world data  mining problems. Association rule, a kind of data mining  strategies, is the main tool to manipulate the dataset, Apriori,  a classic algorithm for learning association rules, is  designed to operate on databases containing transactions  As is common in association rule mining, given a set of  item sets (for instance, sets of retail transactions each listing  individual items purchased), the algorithm attempts to find  subsets which are common to at least a minimum number C  (the cutoff, or confidence threshold) of the item sets. Apriori  uses a "bottom up" approach, where frequent subsets are  extended one item at a time (a step known as candidate  generation), and groups of candidates are tested against the  data. The algorithm terminates when no further successful  extensions are found.

Apriori uses breadth-first search or a generate-and-test  type structure to count candidate item sets efficiently. It  generates candidate item sets of length k from item sets of  length k ? 1. Then it prunes the candidates which have an  infrequent sub pattern, the candidate set contains all  frequent k-length item sets. After that, it scans the  transaction database to determine frequent item sets among  the candidates.

Apriori, while historically significant, suffers from a  number of inefficiencies or trade-offs, which have spawned  other algorithms. Candidate generation generates large  numbers of subsets (the algorithm attempts to load up the  candidate set with as many as possible before each scan).

Bottom-up subset exploration (essentially a breadth-first  traversal of the subset lattice) finds any maximal subset S  only after all 2 | S |  ? 1 of its proper subsets.



IV. Result and discussion  In this research, the information literate parents (653  instances) were divided into three levels, according to their  self-determination on how deep and wide they comprehend  the information technology and knowledge. These three  levels were are beginner, average, and advanced. The  proportion of these parents in these different four levels  were beginner 30.47% (199 instances), average 54.67%  (357 instance), and advanced 14.85% (97 instances).

First, whether parents understood the intention and  content of children?s manipulation on the internet? The  rules as follows:  For the beginner: (N=No, Y=Yes)  1. q12=N q13=N q14=N 85 ==> q15=N 82   conf:(0.96)  2. q13=N q14=N 98 ==> q15=N 94               conf:(0.96)  3. q12=N q14=N 93 ==> q15=N 88               conf:(0.95)  4. q14=N 109 ==> q15=N 102                       conf:(0.94)  For the average:  1. q11=Y q13=Y q15=Y 183 ==> q14=Y 180  conf:(0.98)  2. q13=Y q15=Y 192 ==> q14=Y 187           conf:(0.97)  3. q13=Y q14=Y 210 ==> q11=Y 203           conf:(0.97)  4. q11=Y q15=Y 20 3 ==> q14=Y 196          conf:(0.97)  5.q13=Y  q14=Y q15=Y  18 7==>q11=Y180  conf:(0.96)  6. q13=Y q15=Y 192 ==> q11=Y 183           conf:(0.95)  7. q12=Y 188 ==> q11=Y 178                       conf:(0.95)  8. q14=Y q15=Y 208 ==> q11=Y 196           conf:(0.94)  9. q15=Y 221==> q14=Y 208                        conf:(0.94)  For the advanced:  1. q11=Y q15=Y 74 ==> q14=Y 74              conf:(1)  2. q11=Y 78 ==> q14=Y 77                          conf:(0.99)  3. q11=Y q13=Y 76 ==> q14=Y 75              conf:(0.99)  4. q13=Y q15=Y 76 ==> q14=Y 75              conf:(0.99)  5. q15=Y 81 ==> q14=Y 79                          conf:(0.98)  6. q11=Y 78 ==> q13=Y 76                          conf:(0.97)  7. q11=Y q14=Y 77 ==> q13=Y 75              conf:(0.97)  8. q13=Y 81 ==> q14=Y 78                          conf:(0.96)  9. q13=Y q14=Y 78 ==> q11=Y 75              conf:(0.96)  10. q11=Y 78 ==> q13=Y q14=Y 75             conf:(0.96)  After analyzing the rules of first question, it was found  that the parents of beginner lacked ability to check what  website the child has visited. And also, they could not help  child get the best from the internet. But to the most parents  of average and advanced, they knew child?s activities on the  internet, and how to check the websites the child has visited.

Table I       Attributes and details of dataset  Attribute                                                                    Detail Value  q11~q15: Does parent understand enough about the internet to do any of these things  q11 know what kinds of things the child does on the internet Yes/No  q12 know how to access child's email account Yes/No  q13 know how to check which websites child has visited Yes/No  q14 help child use the internet safely Yes/No  q15 help child get the best out of the internet Yes/No  q21~q24: Do parent do any of these nowadays?

q21 keep an eye on what's on the screen while the child is online Yes/No  q22 check the computer later, to see which sites the child visited Yes/No  q23 check the message in the child's email account Yes/No  q24 get annoyed with the child about his/her use of the internet Yes/No  q31~q36: Some thing child is not allowed to do on the internet.

q31 child is not allowed to give out personal information Yes/No  q32 child is not allowed use email Yes/No  q33 child is not allowed use chat rooms Yes/No  q34 child is not allowed to use instant messaging Yes/No  q35 child is not allowed to play game on the internet Yes/No  q36 child is not allowed to download things (e.g. music, games) Yes/No    Second, how did parents oversee their children while  they were on the internet? The rules as follows:  For the beginners:  1.q21=N q22=N q24=N 60==> q23=N 56    conf:(0.93)  2. q22=N q24=N 131 ==> q23=N 122          conf:(0.93)  3. q21=N q22=N 72 ==> q23=N 67              conf:(0.93)  4. q21=Y q22=N q24=N 71==> q23=N 66   conf:(0.93)  5. q21=N q24=N 68 ==> q23=N 63              conf:(0.93)  For the average:  1. q21=N q22=N q24=N 86 ==> q23=N 83  conf:(0.97)  2. q21=N q22=N 102 ==> q23=N 98           conf:(0.96)  3.q21=Y q22=Y q23=Y 51 ==> q24=N 49  conf:(0.96)  For the advanced  1. q21=N q22=N 26 ==> q23=N 24             conf:(0.92)  2. q21=Y q22=N 22 ==> q24=N 20             conf:(0.91)  From the rules extracted from the second question,  research illustrated that these parents of beginner seemed  not to (or lack the ability to) oversee the content on the  screen or check the message in child?s email account. While  parents of average and advanced would check the sites the  child visited, kept an eye on content, and didn?t get annoyed  with child?s use of the internet.

Third, was there any activity which was not permitted  while children on the internet? The rules as follows:  For the beginners:  1. q34=N q36=N 133 ==> q32=N 129           conf:(0.97)  2. q34=N q36=N 133 ==> q35=N 129           conf:(0.97)  3. q32=N q36=N 143 ==> q35=N 138           conf:(0.97)  4. q34=N 158 ==> q32=N 152                       conf:(0.96)  5. q34=N q35=N 149 ==> q32=N 143           conf:(0.96)  6. q36=N 157 ==> q35=N 150                       conf:(0.96)  7. q34=N 158==> q35=N 149                        conf:(0.94)  8. q32=N q34=N 152 ==> q35=N 143           conf:(0.94)  For the average:  1. q34=N 278  ==> q32=N 274                      conf:(0.99)  2. q34=N q35=N 260 ==> q32=N 256           conf:(0.98)  3. q36=N 277 ==> q35=N 263                      conf:(0.95)  4. q32=N q36=N 262 ==> q35=N 248           conf:(0.95)  5. q36=N 277 ==> q32=N 262                     conf:(0.95)  6. q35=N q36=N 263 ==> q32=N 248         conf:(0.94)  7. q34=N 278 ==> q35=N 260                     conf:(0.94)  For the advanced  1. q34=N 73 ==> q32=N 71                         conf:(0.97)  2. q34=N q35=N 70 ==> q32=N 68             conf:(0.97)  3. q36=N 75 ==> q32=N 72                         conf:(0.96)  4. q34=N 73 ==> q35=N 70                         conf:(0.96)  5. q32=N q34=N 71==> q35=N 68              conf:(0.96)  6. q35=N q36=N 71 ==> q32=N 68             conf:(0.96)     7. q36=N 75==> q35=N 71                          conf:(0.95)  8. q32=N q36=N 72 ==> q35=N 68             conf:(0.94)  To most of the parents in the group of beginner, they did  not permit child using email and playing games on the  internet while the child was not allowed to use instant  messaging. But to another two groups of parents? average  and advanced, using chat rooms was not permitted besides  playing games on the internet if child was not allowed to use  instant messaging.



V. Conclusion Appropriate restriction and conduct can provide children  a safe cyber environment to use home computer and Internet  access, the variation of parents? information literacy will  regulate different rules, but same group of information  literate parents seem to have similar manner and cognition.

By data mining technology, the class owned same  associations between attributes can be sieved out and try to  regularize the rules. But it is not enough, further research  will be necessary to deeply explore the causes and  influences of these associations.
