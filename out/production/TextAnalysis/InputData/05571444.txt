Abstract    Apriori algorithm is a popular classical algorithm of association rule mining. This paper discusses the limitations of the original Apriori algorithm and presents an advanced version of Apriori algorithm to increase the efficiency of generating association rules. Our algorithm uses organized transaction selection approach, where in the rules are generated by picking up the transactions according to the highest order first basis and hence avoiding generation of un-necessary patterns that are not a part of the original database.

The major advantage of our approach is that, the number of database scans is massively reduced, to the order of O(n) i.e., of the order of number of transactions available for frequent  patterns generation. Hence overcomes the time complexity of original Apriori algorithm which is of the order O(en) .

1. Introduction   Data mining is the discovery of the hidden information found in databases and can be viewed as a step in knowledge discovery process. Data mining function includes clustering, classification, prediction and associations [1].

Association rule is first introduced in 1993 by R. Agrawal [2] [3], are used to identify relationship among a set of items in a database. These relationships are not based on inherent properties of the database themselves, but rather based on co-occurrence of the data items.

Association rules are used to show the relationship between data items and are formally defined as follows: Given a  P   DOI 10.1109/ICIIC.2010.64      set of   items I={I1,I2,.,Im} and a database of transaction D={t1,t2,...,tn} where ti={Ii1,Ii2,?,Iik} and Iij ? I, an association rule is an implication of the form x=>y where x,y ? I are set of items called item sets and x?y=? , x  is called antecedent & y  is consequent. The two important basic measures used in association rules are support (s) and confidence (?).

Support (s) of an association rule x=>y is the percentage of transaction in the database that contain x?y.

Confidence or strength (?) for an association rule x=>y is the ratio of the number of transaction that contain x?y to the number of transactions that contain x.

Support(s) is the statistical significance of an association rule and the confidence of a rule indicates the degree of co-relation in the dataset between x and y. Apriori is the most established well known association rule algorithm and used in most commercial products.

The algorithm generates the association rules from a large database using Support and Confidence value. Generally smaller Support value and larger Confidence value are used as thresholds. The original Apriori algorithm is explained in the next section.

1.1 Apriori algorithm  Input: Minimum Support, Minimum Confidence Output: Generation of Association rules Method: 01. k = 1.

02. Fk = {i | i ?I ? ? ({i}) ? N ? minsup}.

03. repeat 04.  k = k+1.

05. Ck = apriori-gen(Fk-1); {Generate candidate item sets} 06. for each transaction t ? T do 07.Ct=subset(Ck, t); {Identify all candidates that belong to t} 08. for each candidate item set c ? Ct do 09.  ?(c) =  ?(c) + 1.

{Increment support count} 10. end for 11. end for 12.Fk = {c| c ?Ck ? ?(c)  ? N ? minsup}.

{Extract the frequent k-itemsets} 13. until Fk = ? 14.  Result = U Fk.

Following steps describes the working nature of the Apriori algorithm.

? The algorithm initially makes a single pass over the data set to determine the support of each item. Upon completion of this step the set of all frequent 1- item sets, F1, will be known (step 1 and 2).

? Next, the algorithm will iteratively generate new candidate k-item sets using the frequent (k-1)-item sets found in the previous iteration (step 5). Candidate generation is implemented using a function called apriori-gen().

? To count the support of the candidates, the algorithm needs to make an additional pass over the data set (Steps 6-10).The subset function is used to determine all the candidate item sets in Ck that are contained in each transaction t.

? After counting their supports, the algorithm eliminates all candidates? item sets whose support counts are less than minimum support (step 12).

? The algorithm terminates when there is no new frequent item sets generated, i.e., Fk=? (step 13).

The basic draw back of this algorithm  is i) generation of huge number of candidate sets ii) repeatedly scans the database for a large set of candidates by pattern matching, hence the original algorithm consumes more time and space.

To overcome the deficiency we modified the Apriori and proposed the new approach of generating the rules.

The structure of the paper is as follows: section2 covers relative work, section3 provides proposed model, section4 presents advanced version of Apriori algorithm and its details, section5 shows theoretical analysis of time complexity, and section6 concludes the paper.

2. Related Work   The FP works [4] [5] on the basis of Depth-first search strategy, but it is infeasible if the database is huge and sparse. The FP-tree grows along with the growth of the number of transactions. In our work we are interested in getting itemsets that are interrelated rather than only the frequency.

Existing Apriori based algorithms are focused on the way candidate itemsets are  generated, usage of optimized data structures for storing itemsets, and implementation details. Several versions of Apriori algorithm are used in various research works. We surveyed all these versions and are presented below.

The paper [6] improves the Apriori All algorithm by including user-ID during every step of candidate set generation and of scanning the data base to decide whether an item in the candidate set generation should be put into large set, which will be used to generate next candidate set. The enhanced version of Apriori algorithm is presented in the paper [7], the efficiency is improved by scanning the database in forward and backward directions. The authors Xiang-wei Liu and Pi-Lian[8] presented Improved Association Rule Mining algorithm. It reduces scanning time of candidate sets using hash tree.

The paper [9] proposed an algorithm named IApriori algorithm, which optimizes the join procedure of frequent itemsets generated to reduce the size of the candidate itemsets. The algorithm presented in the paper [10] scans the database only once to generate a frequent itemsets, thereby saving time and increases efficiency. These methods even though focused on reducing time and space, in real time still needs improvement. We proposes new advanced version of Apriori algorithm to further reduce the time and is discussed in detail in the following sections.

3. Proposed Work      The classical Apriori algorithm follows Bottom-Up approach, it starts from L1 (the single m element set) and proceeds till a Lk (k is lengthiest possible frequent pattern). At each pass, it determines which candidates are frequent by counting their occurrences that exceed the minimum support threshold(s). Then, it checks how often these candidates occur together to measure the support.

Due to combinatory explosion, it leads to poor performance when frequent patterns sizes are large. In our proposed work the bottom-up approach is replaced by organized transaction selection approach.

It starts with maximum element set and proceeds lower down the order that is from Lm down till L1. The following section presents the new advanced version of Apriori Algorithm in detail.

4. Advanced Version of Apriori Algorithm  Input: Database (D), minimum support (min_sup).

Output: frequent item sets in L.

Algorithm steps:  T[array][array]=[Transaction][items] (D) k = No..of items in the longest transaction ( in T[ ] ); for ( Ti = Tid  (longest unvisited T[ ] ) { for each Tl of order Ti.length in T[ ] if (Ti = Tl) Ti.count++; for(temp=0; temp< (k- i.length) temp++) for each Tj of order (k-temp) in T[ ] If ( Ti is a subset of Tj ) Ti.count++; if(Ti.count >= min_sup) Add Ti to L(i); }   Description for the algorithm: ? The transactional data base is considered as T[ ][ ]. Scan the transactional data base to find longest transaction with maximum number of items as Ttemp.

Block Diagram of proposed work      ? For each transaction taken according to their order of length from T[][] as Ti, do the following steps.

For all transactions of length same as Ti.length as Tl  If  Ti == Tl then increment Ti.

Count by 1 For all transactions of order > Ti.length; as Tj  If Ti belongs to Tj increment count of Ti by 1.

Finally check for the Support count validation and add to the corresponding Li.

5. Time complexity Analysis   This section provides a comparative analysis of time complexities between original Apriori algorithm and our new Advanced Version of Apriori algorithm.

5.1 Time complexity of Apriori algorithm   Worst Case conditions, ? All transactions have m items, where m is number of  items ? Each count needs for L(i) needs [n  mCi] operations, where n is  number of transactions ? At the worst case there can appear  frequent items of length m.

Total Complexity of time ? Time taken for generation of frequent items + Time taken for rule generation.

Time taken for generation of frequent items  = n  mC1 + nm C2 +  .. n. mCm  =  n ??? naseO n )( .

Time for Rule generation of k terms set is given by  =  kC1 + kC2 + ........ + k Cn  = ? ? ?  ?  ? ? ?  ? ?? =  =  ==  j  i i  j mk  mJk  C kc 11    = O(n)  Total time ?  n.

5.2 Time complexity of the proposed algorithm   Satisfactory worst case conditions, ? min ? sup = 1.

? k = m, m is number of items.

? =? m  Tj of order j (j < = n)      i.e., there exists at least one transaction for all orders from 1 to m where j is transaction ID (J < n) )   Total Complexity of time ?Time for generation of frequent items + Time for rule generation.

Time for generation of frequent items =  ? ? ?  ?  ? ? ?  ? +??  ?  ? ?? ?  ? ?+?? ??  ?  ==  1)1())1((  im  temp  m  i nmn   Here (n-(m-1)) is got by assuming except (m-1) items all item are of order i for each ith  iteration.

The     is for each (temp) iteration, there can exist at the max (n-1) higher order elements considering the current order elements considering the current one to be of the least order.

And final validation for support count is indicated as 1.

Time for Rule generation of m terms sets = O(n)(same as in Apriori algorithm)  Total time ?  O(n) ______  (2)  5.3 Comparative result   From equation (1) we observe that original Apriori algorithm has an exponential time complexity of order O(en).

From equation (2) we have a linear time complexity for our new Advanced version of Apriori algorithm i.e., of the order O(n).

Hence proposed algorithm works efficiently compared to classical Apriori algorithm with a linear growth of timings with respect to number of transactions.

6. Experimental Results   NASA server web log file of 195MB data is used for experimental purpose.

After preprocessing, the data base size is reduced to 36MB due to the elimination unnecessary data sets. From this preprocessed data 1891715 records were considered and from which, we obtained 26938 unique users of 38714 sessions as a training data set.

The experiments were run on Pentium? dual CPU working at 1.73GHz, with 2GB of RAM. The observation is carried out under WAMP server.

The performances of both Apriori and proposed advanced version of Apriori are observed with respect to Execution time measured under number of PHP instruction norms.

The following Tables 1.and Table 2.

shows experimental values of number of transactions and execution time for Original Apriori and proposed Advanced Apriori algorithms respectively.

7. Conclusions   In this paper, the advanced version of Apriori algorithm is proposed to overcome the deficiency of the basic      Apriori algorithm. The basic Apriori algorithm follows Bottom-Up approach where as the proposed method follows organized transaction selection approach.

It avoids the generation of combinations of items which inturn reduces the number of database scans. The result shows improvement in execution time.
