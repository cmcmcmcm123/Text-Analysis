Abstract-This paper proposes a new method of data mining called Association Network (AE), combining the association analysis and sequential pattern. After having AE positioned in terms of time and quantity, it could be used to control inventory without main plans. AE is proved to be able to improve the efficiency of inventory control though simulation and test on inventory data. Besides, this paper also builds a framework of decision support system which can improve the performance of inventory control by making full use of AE.

Keywords:  inventory control; associated demand; association analysis; sequential patterns    ?.  INTRODUCTION  Data Mining has been widely used in business application. However there is relatively scarce literature on data mining application in inventory management. Xiao, Chang and Guo (2008) examined the project importance evaluation under the cross-effects, their paper presents an ?Expect the amount of Occupation? index by the association as well as a new ABC classification of inventory. Besides, Ma has also introduced the associated rules into the goods classification in customs declarations audit, aiming to find the relationship between the declaration of goods and classification with the Apriori algorithm. On the other hand, for last  few decades, there has been a lot of achievement made in research of the inventory control theory.

The optimal economic lot size models solve the problem of the most cost-effective order number and order quantity, Corporate MRP solve problem of arrangements for the production of materials procurement and inventory.

Just-in-time aims to reduce the production uncertainty by establishing a good relationship with suppliers, and thereby reducing the inventory. However, due to various reasons, these inventory management methods have already emerged a variety of constraints and disadvantages. Little data mining literature in inventory control.

Data mining can help solve the complicated issues like the huge amount of data as well as the internal relationships. However, there are many problems if we use the existing classical algorithm for data mining in inventory control.

In this paper, we will select an appropriate mining algorithm and modify it for inventory control models. Therefore, a new method of data mining called association network will prove efficiency and flexibility.

?.   ASSOCIATION NETWORK   Stock data and flow data constitute an  inventory database since different materials and their time of using has a wide range of uncertain relevance. As the materials commonly used in the production have frequent records while some      materials may occur once in the inventory database. Considering of the characteristics, methods like simple association rules, sequential patterns mining as well as the traditional time-series model or a more advanced support vector regression and random forest regression will not well solve the problem of forecasting on inventory data. Construction steps of association network:   A.   Preliminary Work  Firstly, divide the database into several sub-libraries. Make sure materials within the same sub-division of library has strong correlation while not strong correlation between different sub-libraries. Secondly, association rules and sequential patterns mining on each library, we can get correspondingly A-Rule base and S-Rule base.

B.  Construction of Association Networks  For every sub-libraries, construction steps are alike. They are Initial main path selection, Branch generation and then Branch pruning   Time positioning Time interval between the various elements  needed determining if we use the above association network into inventory control. The data sample shows that transaction corresponding to each rule takes on different time interval, sometimes even great difference.

Therefore, a more robust statistics is required.

Considering the material?s time interval distribution is skewed to the right at most of the time, trimmed mean is a better choice. We use 30% unequal trimmed mean,  that is remove the smallest 5% and the largest 25%of the transaction. Here we have an example, see as follows. Diagram shows the sequential pattern rules? time interval: requisitioned materials?? antifreeze cream\DingJiaYi 1*4\? then ?line gloves\21*9 Unit\?   FREQUENCY               i nterval  MIDPOINT  3 9 15 21 27 33 39 45 51 57 63   Obviously, the time interval is not concentrated, distributed in a segment from 5 days to 65 days. 5% of quantile is 7.0000000, while 75% of quantile is 35.0000000, 10% of censored quantile is 18.823333. So count the interval as 19 days if ignoring decimals.

Quantity positioning One more step can we use the network in  demand forecasting, that?s determination the quantitative relationship. Using ratio or fitting linear regression is a proper way. Same example from above. Consideration of outliers, we use the 20% trimmed mean.

FREQUENCY                  r MIDPOINT  0.1 0. 2 0. 3 0. 4 0. 5 0.6 0. 7 0. 8 0. 9 1. 0 1.1 1.2   The ratio is mostly concentrated in 0.2 to 0.6, with the truncation average of 0.341759. That is, if the demand of gloves is 100 then the next will be demand of 35 sets of antifreeze cream in 19 days. With this quantitative relationship in network, we can easily provide information on quantity and timing of future demand.

?.   APPLICATION OF ASSOCIATION  NETWORK IN INVENTORY CONTROL    Here we use a real data empirical analysis to investigate whether the association network can      improve the inventory management performance.

The data sample was taken from the Henan Olifield?s SAP system of China Sinopec. Data is mainly consisted of two parts, one is warehouse materials payment flow from October 31,2005 to March 17,2009. The other is warehouse stock of March 17, 2009.

A.  Association Rules Mining   First, let the ?cost center? as the ID variable, mobile type as ZT5, that defines the sending materials to cost center as a pick-up activities, and materials code as the target variable.

Secondly, divide all the transactions from October 31, 2005 to March 17, 2009 into the same time point in accordance with the date.

Different to customer shopping behavior, the demanded materials in warehouse are not picked up in the point time but always removed in a period of time, according to production schedules. Therefore, we should consider the point time as a period of time. Here we take 10 days as a period time, materials picked up within 10 days is counted as a ?blanket?. Mining individually on a random sample of 50 time periods, SAS EM association node would be of great help. The parameters we set is minsup of 20%, minconf of 10%. From the results of 50 models, we select the results of confidence level greater than 20% and support more than 10% as rules.

B.  Sequential Pattern Mining   Let the ?cost center? as the ID variable, mobile type as ZT5, that?s define the sending materials to cost center as a pick up activities , materials code as the target variable, and the pick up data as sequential variables. Sequential data mining on all the 137,986 records set both minsup and minconf 10%.

C.  Association Network   We establish the inventory control association  network based on the above association and sequential rules. Besides, two exogenous variables required setting parameter: minimum support and maximum width. As shown below, box represent a node material, arrows represent the main path. Information included in box is the material code, description, calculated demand time frame as well as upstream materials and the ratio between the quantity of materials. In the vicinity of arrows, S indicates the rule?s support while C indicates the rule?s confidence. As we can see, the depth of main path is 5, maximum width is 2. Up to two-layer hierarchy, a pre-determined minsup of 10%,minconf of 40%.

Then the overall support for the main path is 10.43%, confidence is 75%.

D.  Simulation and Test       Still use the example above. We take anti-freeze cream as the input node. On one hand, the time picking up the cream is relatively determined, on the other hand, the sequence with anti-freeze cream as starting point has relatively high support. Therefore, anti-freeze cream as the input node is appropriate. Input the information of actual storage and requisition records, then simulate the procurement plan of the other materials on the network. Supposing that the materials can be obtained instantly and generate a new storage date and quantity while requisition information remains as the original data. Here we get the turnover rate, calculated from simulated data and original data.

Wool-like material pants, transparent soap and some have very obvious improvement.

Sorghum broom is the only one whose turnover days get a slight increase than before. In order to better illustrate the changes in inventory turnover days, we get further statistical test.

Test Statistics P value  Significant under 5%  Student t 2.380967 0.0385 Yes Sign 4.5 0.0117 Yes Signed-rank 32 0.0020 Yes   The test agrees with the results that inventory  turnover days of these materials in the network have decreased. It means association network do have significant effect in inventory control.

?.   INVENTORY MANAGEMENT  SUPPORT SYSTEM BASED ON  ASSOCIATION NETWORK    Follow the ways of establishing and using association network, we can design an appropriate inventory management decision support system which can be embedded into the existing ERP or MRP system. If done, people may get better knowledge management and more convenient inventory planner. We try as you can see below.

After starting the inventory management  decision support system, input the information of the node, including the specific time of the needs, quantity. If the date between the system and the starting node of the main path are far in distance, you should use the latest material information as  Man-Machine Interface  Use  DMS  Databas  cont  rol  sup por  Inference  Association  Constructu on network  A-Rule  S-Rule base  Rule-ba      the initial information. Pre-process module calls in the inventory stock data in association network, and searches the needed materials? code, stock and demand quantity. Then it goes to the inference agency of which the function has been described above. Ways the planner can take are, no procurement plan (with external information that there is no need of the materials), make the procurement plan follow the tips (the tips are reasonable), make the procurement plan but partly refer the tips (the tips somewhat reasonable and there is some other more clearly information like quantity), delay the decision (not clear sure of whether we should purchase or a clear idea of the demand after this date). At last, the system output the procurement plan as the way what the planner input.

?.   SUMMARY   Though information is critical resources for  enterprise especially in increasingly fierce competition, for the today?s enterprise, the problem is not lack but how if the manager manage and make good use of the information.

In this paper, we establish an inventory association network, both simulation and test prove its efficiency. As we can see, model used in Information management should not only re-model by the result but also adapt to the specific background, what?s more, updating is of great importance since knowledge is always on the way and needs to modify.

However, there are still some shortcomings in our study. May it can take as a reference for the future researchers. First, when mining the inventory data with association rule and sequential pattern, there is no much consideration of the hierarchy. Since some materials can replace each other while other materials are irreplaceable. The consideration of hierarchy is appropriate. Though the hierarchy  association rule can improve the situation, there is difficulties in identify relationship from huge amount of inventory data. Secondly, it is still worth discussing how to divide database into sub-libraries. Different divisions can have different effects on the network performance. In the end, whether or not can the association network be applicable to other business area such as network marketing, etc.
