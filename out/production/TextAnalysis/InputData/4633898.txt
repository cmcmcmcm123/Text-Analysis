Discovery of Association Rules in Metabolic Syndrome Related Diseases

Abstract?Since 1980, the Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus in Metabolic Syndrome have appeared in the top ten causes of death every year in Taiwan. This research aims to study Metabolic Syndrome related disease by using data mining technique, and to understand the strength of association between Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia. The data of this research came from the National Health Insurance Research Database provided by the Bureau of National Health Insurance, Department of Health. It includes the Diabetes Mellitus patients? health insurance record during 2003-2005 in Taiwan. We used association rules to find diseases patterns of Metabolic Syndrome related disease. Using data mining technique can find and confirm the relation between diseases. We found Diabetes Mellitus is related to oral diseases and blear eyes.

We also found that patients with Metabolic Syndrome have higher connection with liver diseases than patients with Diabetes Mellitus.

I. INTRODUCTION  The whole National Health Insurance Research Database is a goldmine with tons of undiscovered knowledge and information. Gillespic [1] proposed to find important relation in diseases is helpful in constructing diagnose guideline and preventing of diseases. Owing to the sedentary life style and the lack of the exercise, there exist many diseases related to bad metabolism [2]. In 1998, Reaven gave the concept of Metabolic Syndrome, which includes five symptoms, they are Abdominal obesity (excessive fat tissue in and around the abdomen), Atherogenic dyslipidemia (blood fat disorders ? high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol and high LDL cholesterol ? that foster plaque buildups in artery walls), Elevated blood pressure, Insulin resistance or glucose intolerance (the body can?t properly use insulin or blood sugar) Prothrombotic state (e.g., high fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitor?1 in the blood), Proinflammatory state (e.g., elevated C-reactive protein in the blood). The most related diseases are Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus. These two diseases in the past twenty years are listed on the Top Ten Causes of Death in  Manuscript received November 30, 2007. This work was supported by National Science Council, Taivan. Project NSC 94-2745-E-155-009-URD.

Taiwan[3]. According to the prevalence and high mortality rate, Metabolic Syndrome involves many people over the world. People with Metabolic Syndrome have twice risk to get heart diseases, and the death rate is 2.5 times more than normal people. This research use data mining technique and the National Health Insurance Research Database to find the diseases associated with Diabetes Mellitus.



II. METABOLIC SYNDROME  Metabolic Syndrome was announced when Reaven [4] get the most representative award-Banting Award from American Diabetes Association in 1988. He mentioned that if one person has three of the five symptoms: Type two Diabetes, Blood Pressure? 140/90mmHg, HDL cholesterol<35mg/dl, Central obesity, Triglycerides? 150mg/dl, he can be decided as a Metabolic Syndrome patient. Researchers have shown that Metabolic Syndrome is connected with cardiovascular diseases [5-9].



III. DATA AND METHOD  This study used the data from National Health Insurance Research Database, and focus on the population from northern Taiwan area, including Taipei city, Taipei County, Keelung, Yilan County, Kinmen County. We used the diabetes ICD-9 to sift our data out of the whole database. All patients who have the Diabetes Mellitus ICD-9 in the past two years from 2003-2005 are included in this study. We used the SPSS Clementine 8.1 package software to clean the data and adopted the Apriori as the mining method to find the association rules.



IV. RESULT  A. Diabetes Mellitus  The raw data of this study contains 10,192,166 records, which includes total 163,045 diabetes patients, 79,721(48.89%) male patients, 82,978(50.89%) female patients and 336(0.19%) of foreign patients. The average times of consultation per Diabetes patient in two years is 62.51. The average times of consultation per Diabetes patient in one year is 31.25. Compared with the National Health Insurance Annual Statistics Information Service released data, the average times of consultation per patient between 40 and 64 is 13.99 and age over 65 is 38.21.

The significant difference shows that the high frequent consultation of diabetes patient is very serious. The      patients? ages ranged mostly from 50 to 80 years old.

Female diabetes patients on 60 years old to 80 have more than one third proportion. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus will increase with age, and the aging affect on female is more apparently (Fig 1).

Fig1. Diabetes prevalence  B. Hypertension & Hyperlipidemia  There is 2,440,107 records of ICD-9 Hypertension and hyperlipidemia in the database, which consists of 32,167 patients. Among them, they are 13,543 males and 18,624 females; apparently there is higher population on female.

After calculation, the prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome shows in table 1. From the table we can see that there will be one more Metabolic Syndrome patient in every hundred of adults. Female patients have higher prevalence at age over 55, and it increased with time. The trend of Metabolic Syndrome prevalence goes with linear, there is strong connection with age and prevalence, as the following Fig 2.

Fig 2. Metabolic Syndrome Prevalence  C. Data mining  1) Strength of Diabetes Among type two Diabetes Mellitus, can categorize into  diabetes mellitus without mention of complication, diabetes with ketoacidosis, diabetes with hyperosmolar coma, diabetes with other coma, diabetes with renal manifestations, diabetes with ophthalmic manifestations, diabetes with neurological manifestations, diabetes with peripheral circulatory disorders, Diabetes with other specified manifestations, diabetes with unspecified complication. In the main Taipei area, diabetes mellitus without mention of complication has the largest proportion, then is diabetes with neurological manifestations, then is diabetes with renal manifestations, then is diabetes with ophthalmic manifestations. The distribution of diseases on male and female is the same as the whole group.

On the strength of sex and diseases, there exist diagnoses that diabetes mellitus and Hypertrophy (benign) of prostate appear in the same time that doctor diagnose a male patient. And on the female patients have urinary tract infection, Menopausal or female climacteric state diagnosed by doctor in the same time. Diabetes patients have apparently complication over embolism. In the past research has talk about the connection, it?s worthy of diabetes patients? concern. Conjunctivitis and cataract has more appearance on female patients more than male.

2) Data mining on Diabetes  Diabetes has been recognized as a disease of civilization in medical science and it belongs to chronic diseases. Patients need to fight and treat it in a long-term period. Without careful diet, it?s easily to get complication.

This research aims the main factor of Metabolic Syndrome to find the relation between diseases, and verify the result from the research at present. The following describes the mining result and the explanation specifically by diseases section.

? Flu  The mining results with the highest support are ICD-9 related with flu. They are Acute upper respiretory infection(4659), Acute bronchitis(4660), Acute laryngopharyngitis(460), Acute nasopharyngitis (4650). In the past two year diabetes records, the confidence patients diagnosed flu up to 90 percent. Following table 2 shows the mining result. The flu is the infection of the upper respiratory tract caused by filterable virus, and the kind of the filterable virus reaches 150 kinds, its symptom includes: Shed nose ink, a stuffy nose, sneeze , cough , sore throat , the sound is hoarse , have a fever , be tired , have a headache , suffer from diarrhea etc., when human body' s resistance is lowered, it will be apt to beinfected by the virus naturally. Diabetes patient will be lower than common people at immunity, the body metabolism is worse than common people. The resistances of filterable virus become useless and catch a cold frequently.

? Oral Diseases  Through the mining of Apriori, there is lot of oral diseases association rules exist in the result. As the following table 3, these diseases includes Dental caries (5210), Pulpitis (5250), Acute gingivitis (5230), Periodontosis (5235). Taylor probe into relevant research since 1960 , half research show diabetes influence oral diseases , the research of the remaining half thinks that there is not absolute relation in the diabetes and oral disease (Taylor et al., ). The scholar in Taiwan mostly admit that the diabetes influence the oral cavity disease as major factor. Though the scholars have different argument, the mining results assure findings that diabetes is one main factor that influences oral diseases. People need extra attention to clean the mouth area in order to prevent the oral diseases.

? Blear There are higher confidence and related diabetes with  Senile cataract (36610), and Chronic conjunctivitis (37210),as the following table 4. Kurse used the way of human experiment to prove that the diabetes in the  chronic disease is a dangerous factor which causes conjunctivitis. Diabetes is related with conjunctivitis and Senile cataract. In the result of Apriori, its confidence and support shows that these relations covered 12.8% of the dataset. It?s still need to be noticed.

The most obvious disease is hypertension, and then is hyperlipidemia and diabetes. The number of times that diabetes and heart disease are diagnosed at the same time is up to 49,020. In addition, every hundred patients have 2 diagnosed heart diseases. Metabolic Syndrome Patients need care about the high risk of getting cardiovascular disease. In addition, there also have the diagnose relation similar with the Diabetes patients. Among the three major diseases of Metabolic Syndrome, there is more records related with Mixed hyperlipidemia and Diabetes with neurological manifestations, then is Diabetes with renal manifestations and Diabetes mellitus without mention of  complication. The frequency can also be a guide. when diagnose, and to know the relation between specific diabetes and hyperlipidemia.

4) Data mining on Metabolic Syndrome On the association rules of Apriori, the disease has a lot  of repetitiveness with the diabetes patients. The main factor of Metabolic Syndrome is type two Diabetes, so the relevant disease that the diabetes causes - oral diseases, blear and kidney failure all need to pay extra attention.

The other special association ones are described as following.

Contact dermatitis and other eczema In the results, Contact dermatitis and other eczema  (6929) have the highest support and confidence. Table 5 shows the data and related diseases. Contact dermatitis  Instances Support Confidence Consequent Antecedent1 Antecedent2  20656 13.3 61.7 Diabetes mellitus  without mention of complication, Type II  Chronic conjunctivitis,  unspecified  Acute upper respiratory infections of other  multiple sites  16978 10.9 59.7 Acute upper respiratory  infections of other multiple sites  Senile cataract, unspecified  Diabetes mellitus without mention of  complication, Type II  20656 13.3 39.6 Dental caries Chronic  conjunctivitis, unspecified  Diabetes mellitus without mention of  complication, Type II  Table 4. Diabetes Apriori Mining Result Blear  2008 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2008) 859    and other eczema is the skin that contacts materials and causes the inflammation of producing and irritated phenomenon. As long as find out the source and avoid the pathogenically, belong to Contact Dermatitis, not the complication of the nonspecific chronic disease.

Urinary system In the urinary system, male have the diagnosis on  disease about Hypertrophy (benign) of prostate, and the whole group have the diseases connected with urinary infection. Table 6 shows the data and ICD-9 in detail.

There is no relevant research probe into the disease of  urinary system to Metabolic Syndrome. But in type II Diabetes, Holland scholar, Meller proved Diabetes as a dangerous factor infected the urinary system in the way of linear regression. The result confirmed that the type II Diabetes is dangerous factors causing the urinary tract to infect. This association rules in type II Diabetes didn?t appear, but was found in the Metabolic Syndrome result.

It revealed that patients with Diabetes, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia will get urinary diseases easier than patient with only Diabetes diseases.

There is up to 70% of confidence that Metabolic Syndrome patients have liver disease connection with Diabetes, Hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The following table 7 shows the mining result. The chronic hepatitis includes chronic virus hepatitis mainly have A , B , C , D , E five types, the alcoholic hepatitis, and fatty liver. Metabolic Syndrome patients may have unusual liver function cause of fat, or other metabolism causes induce to chronic hepatitis. No related studies show this connection at present. This research used the mining of Apriori find a considerable association that can help specialist as an assistance of diagnose. And it also warned the metabolic syndromes patients to take care of their livers.



V. CONCLUSION This research used the method of descriptive statistic to  realize the prevalence and population of the two groups, Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome patients.

From the descriptive statistic, there are more patients of females than males, and it will increase with aging.

Insurance used in these two groups are calculated and is useful for the National Health Insurance .Our result can provide the National Health Insurance carrying on survey on the related insurance fee. Adjust the expense and the incoming of specific groups, and improve the reasonable use of health resources.

In practical, data mining used in lots of area and had a great outcomes, but in medical diagnose assistance, there  is few research that study on the relation between ICD-9.

This research used the association rules mining the Health Insurance Data which includes more than 10 million records. Complete consultation records made this research more significant. The Metabolic Syndrome gets more and more attention from the public and the medical science and considered as a disease of civilization. The coming diseases are discussed in many researches. Using mining method to find diseases from Diabetes and from Metabolic Syndrome is the main goal of this research, the result can be concluded into two region as follow.

1) Type two diabetes associated diseases In the past diagnosed records of type two Diabetes  patients, ICD-9 of Diabetes will be related with oral diseases (Periodontosis, Pulpitis, Dental caries, Acute gingivitis). These mining results are the same as the clinical experiments and the present research.

Furthermore, diseases conjunctivitis and Senile cataract, cardiovascular disease are connected with Diabetes.

Because there exist intersection influence between diseases, the mining result can be a diagnose support when doctors giving a diagnosis.

2) Metabolic Syndrome associated diseases Besides the association rules found in the Diabetes, the  more important is that the affect of urinary system and the liver organ. Metabolic Syndrome patients have more issues than Diabetes patients in urinary system. The association rules mining from the data have higher support and confidence. Besides, chronic liver and the  Instances Support Confidence Consequent Antecedent 1 Antecedent 2  5148 16 68.5 Diabetes mellitus  without mention of complication, Type II  Chronic hepatitis, unspecified  Malignant hypertensive heart disease without  congestive heart failure  7957 24.7 40.8 Chronic hepatitis, unspecified  Acute upper respiratory infections of other multiple  sites  Table 7. Diabetes Apriori Mining Result Liver  2008 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2008) 861    relation between Metabolic Syndrome is the new findings from our research.

From our research, we prove that using data mining can find the relation of diseases that are similar with the results which are experimented from clinical. And some results that are not proved by clinical experiment, such as the connection between liver and Metabolic Syndrome.

The relation between diseases can help the doctor diagnose in order to prevent the occurrence of illness. The way of our research also provides the medical research a different way to explore physical mystery.
