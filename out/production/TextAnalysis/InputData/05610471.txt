Incremental Association Rule Mining Based on Artificial Immune

Abstract-Most of the incremental association rule mining methods must rerun through processed data and have not made the best of the given rules. In this paper we propose an incremental association rules algorithm, this algorithm applies artificial immune theory and takes advantage of the given rules produced by original data set. Based on the quickly response during the memory cell recognizing the antigen, the algorithm is faster. The best rules are selected from the given rules as the optimum memory cell through promoting or inhibiting the antibodies, so the interest of the final rules is improved. The algorithm has better performance compared to FUP algorithm, especially in the number of the new transactions is less than half the number of transactions in the original data set, the time-consuming of the FUP algorithm is more than 10 times to this algorithm.

I. INTRODUCTION  Association rule mining is an important area of data mining. An classical association rule mining algorithm was introduced by Agrawal et al[l], breadth-first method is adopted in the algorithm to produce a set of candidate itemsets and then frequent itemsets. J .Han come up with the FP-Growth algorithm[2] which need not produce the candidate itemsets, the database is compressed into a structure called FP-tree, then mining the FP-tree in the way of recursion, and produce the whole frequent itemsets at last.

These algorithms are data mining methods in static database, but the database in reality is dynamic. When the new data are put into database, the rules based on the initial database can not be adapted to the updated database.

Cheung put forward an incremental association rule algorithm based Apriori algorithm called Fast Update(FUpi3].To execute Apriori on both the new data set and the old data set, then compare the frequent itemsets produced by the two data set, to decide whether to mine the old data set again or not.

The incremental association rule algorithms described above are executed again on the whole updated data set or on the data set which is composed by the new data set and some transactions from the old database. The algorithms can not take full advantage of the produced association rules. In this paper, an incremental association rule based   Wei Xiao Limei Zhang Computer Science and Computer Science and  Engineering School Engineering School ChangChun University of ChangChun University of  Technology Technology ChangChun, JiLin, PR ChangChun, JiLin, PR  China China xiaowei@mail.ccut.edu.cn zhanglimei@mail.ccut.edu  .cn  on Artificial Immune is proposed, the produced association rules are used to mine the new data set and then to update the association rule set.

The remaining of this paper is organized as follows.

We brief review of basic knowledge in Section 2. The Promising incremental association rule algorithm is described in Section 3. We evaluate the application in Section 4. Finally, we conclude the work of this paper in section 5

II. BASIC KNOWLEDGE  In this paper, the Artificial Immune theory is applied into the association rules mining, the produced association rules are used during the updating of association rule set.

We introduce some related knowledge and theory in this section.

A. Association rules  Association rule mmmg searches for interesting relationships among items in a given data set, the earliest form of association rule mining is market basket analysis.

For instance, if customers are buying milk, how likely are they to also buy bread on the same trip to the supermarket?

So, the association rule is an implication like X?Y, where X and Y are sets of items called itemsets, An itemset that contains k items is a k-itemset.

There are two measures for each association rule support and confidence, where support representing the percentage of data samples that contains X and Y in the data set at the same time, which measures the statistic importance of the association rule. Confidence describes the percentage of data samples that contains X and also contain Y in D, which assesses the degree of certainty of the detected association rule. Let D be a related data set, count(X) is the count of samples which contain X in D, support(X) describes the support of X, confidence(X) is  the confidence of X, XuY is the transaction that contain X  and Y in D. the support and confidence of association rule X?Y can be described as the following expression (1) and (2).

(X y) count(X u J? support => = --'------'- IDI (1)  con I e nc => = ----'---'---'---------'-ifid e(X Y) sup port( Xu Y)  sup port( X ) (2)  CMCE 2010    In the application of association rule mining, user need to appoint the a minimum support threshold (min_sup) and a minimum confidence threshold (min_cont), rules that satisfY both min_sup and min_conf are useful rules called strong, the object of association rule mining is to fmd the strong rules.

B. Artificial Immune theory  At present, more and more research focus on the Artificial Immune area, the works on Artificial Immune extend to more wide fields from theory studying, the research production involve computer security, engineering optimization, data mining, controlling, fault diagnosis and so on. Artificial Immune has been a focus in artificial intelligence field after neural network, fuzzy logic and evolutionary computing.

Artificial Immune System (AIS) is from biology immune system, the biomimetic mechanism of AIS include immune recognition, immune study, immune memory, clone selection etc.

Immune recognition is a critical in AIS, it's nature is to distinguish self and non-self. Immune recognition distinguishes non-self through the combination of antibody on lymphocyte and antigen, the intensity of the combination is called affinity. Accordingly, signature matching is used to recognize antigen in AIS, it's essence is to define a threshold value, and we can measure the matching in many ways. Immune recognition is a learning process as well, the result is to improve the affmity of the immune cell, to extend the population size and save the best individuality as immune memory cell.

Immune memory is corresponding to secondary response and crossing response. When the antigens invade, Immune system will produce the antibody and remember the antigen, so that the immune system will response more efficiently and quickly when the same or the similar antigens come again.

Immune control means that immune system can promote or inhibit the antibody through the immune balance functions by itself. For the antibody with higher affmity in the antibody population, we will examine it's concentration, then to decide whether put it into the memory cell pool or not. If the antibody has higher affmity and lower concentration, it will be put into the memory cell pool. If the antibody has higher affmity and higher concentration, it will be put into the memory cell pool too, but those antibody which has high affmity with it will be inhibited. With immune control the antibody population will contain the antibody with high affmity and keep the diversity of antibody.



III. INCREMENTAL ASSOCIATION RULES MINING BASED ON ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE  A. Basic Concepts  Antigen[4] means the molecule which can be recognized by antibody in immunology. In Artificial Immune system, antigen indicates the solving problem, and it has distinct code for different problems.

Antibody[4] means the receptor produced by B lymphocyte which react with antigen in immunology. In Artificial Immune system, antibody is the optimized solution of solving problem.

Information entropy[5], there are M antibodies, each one has N genes. The information entropy of the gene j on all antibodies is defmed by following expression (3).

s Ej(M) = L - Pi) 19(pi))  ;=1 (3) Where s is the number of characters in character set  coded for gene, if binary is adopted, s is equal to 2. Pi) is the probability of gene i located on location j, namely the ratio between counts of the gene i located on the locationj and M The average information entropy of M antibodies can be defmed by the following expression (4).

E(M)=_I IEj(M) N j? ?  Affinity[4] means the intensity of combination between the antibody and antigen. In Artificial Immune system, it is the similarity defined by the distance between the two data.

Information entropy is introduced in this paper to indicate the affinity between an antibody and an antigen or two antibodies. The affmity Avw for antibodies v and w can be defined by the following expression (5).

Avw = ----1 + E(2) (5)  Adaptive function of antibody[4] is used to judge the antibody. To select a right adaptive function is a key problem of data mining based on immune. For antibody X, the adaptive function f(x) is defined as the following expression (6).

f ( X ) = a x support( X) + b x confidence( X ) minsupport min confidence (6)  Where O<a<I, O<b<l, a<b, and a+b=l.

Concentration[5] is used to measure the diversity of  antibody population. The concentration of antibody v can be defined by the following expression (7).

C = N v v M (7) Where Nv is the number of antibodies whose affinity is  higher than the affinity threshold.

In immunology, remember cell[4] is the B cell stored in  the immune system, so that the same or similar pathogen can be killed later. In this paper, the rules which has high adaptive value and low concentration are selected as remember cells to recognize the transactions inserted into the database later.

To kill the pathogen, immune system need produce a number of B cell, while antibodies are increased. This procedure is called clone amplification[4] and this property of immune system indicates that immune system has adaptability.

B. Algorithm step and algorithm description  There are three steps in this algorithm as following.

(I) Select antibodies as memory cell To compute the adaptive value by adaptive function for  each rule in the given rule set, the affmity between antibodies, and then to compute the concentration of antibody. To select the rules with high adaptive value into the memory cell set, if the concentration of the selected antibody is higher than the concentration threshold, inhibit those rules whose affinity with the selected rule is higher    than the affinity threshold. This method can keep the diversity and orthogonality.

Calculate the affinity between rule r in M and the transactions in the new data set d, put the transactions whose affinity is higher than affinity threshold into the subset Subr? Calculate the affinity between the left part of rule r in M and the transactions in the new data set d, put the transactions whose affinity is higher than affinity threshold into the subset Subr(l).

According to the definition of support and confidence, recalculate the support and confidence for each rule based on the following expressions (8) and (9).

I D I x Sup old (r )+ I d I x ? Sup (r) = I d I IDI+ldl ?)  con I l ? ?: 1 ?Ub r 1 x (I D 1 x Sup old (r)+ 1 Sub r I)  Con(r} = r(l) IDlxSupoAr)xSubr +IS b 1 C () U r X onold r Subr(l) (9) Input: memory cell set M, the adaptive value array F,  the count of transactions in the original data set IDI, the new data set d, support threshold min_support, confidence threshold min _ corifidence.

Output: Rule set Rnew Main procedure: For (each rule r in M) {  Execute clone amplification[61, the number is F(r)  xlal For (each transaction t in d) {   }  }  Calculate the affmity Ar-t between r and t, calculate the affinity Ar(l)-t between t and the left part of r  If (Ar_t>min _ afJ) then Put t into the sub set Subr  If (Ar(l)-t> min _ afJ) then Put t into the sub set Subr(l)  Calculate the support Sup(r) of rule r follow the expression (8)  Calculate the confidence Con(r) of rule r follow the expression (9)  If (Sup (r?min _support and Con(r?min_corifidence) then  Put r into the rule set Rnew  (3) Generate the new rules For those transactions which can not be assigned to sub  set, we will execute any association rule mining algorithm to create some new rules. Calculate the support and confidence of the new rule in the additional data set d, if the support and confidence is higher than the support threshold and confidence threshold, put the rule into the updated rule set Rnew. In this paper we execute the Apriori algorithm on the left transactions.



IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS  The incremental association rule mining algorithm was applied in the communication network alarm. The alarm data describe the abnormal condition of hardware or software during the communication network is working.

There are 5 properties in alarm information, include alarm devices, alarm ports, alarm type, alarm time and alarm level, the value of the front 4 properties decide the value of the alarm level as critical alarm, important alarm, secondary alarm or warning alarm. To discrete the values of the 5 properties and then code them with integer before execute the algorithm.

During the whole experiment, the threshold of minimum support is 0.10 and the minimum confidence is 0.50. There are 10000 records in the original data set, the additional data set include 1000,2000,3000,4000 and 5000 records respectively. Figure I describes the ratio of FUP and the algorithm introduced in this paper with the increasing of the additional data set. Commonly, the bigger additional data set, the more different between the additional data set and the original data set, so figure I shows that the distance between the two algorithms is reducing with the increasing of the additional data set.

When the additional data set is not bigger than the original data set, the algorithm is efficient.

Ration of running time between FUP and the algorithm  introduced in this paper  In addition, the algorithm extract the memory cell on the given rule set before executing the data mining on the additional data set. Calculate the affinity of rules and select the rule with high adaptive value as memory cell, so the rules produced by the algorithm are more interesting than those created by FUP.



V. CONCLUSION  The database is changing in reality; the rules on the original data set will be changed with the insertion of the new transactions. The aim of the incremental association rule mining based on Artificial Immune is to update the given rules with the updating of the database, and to discover the new rules as well. The experiment shows that   This algorithm is faster than FUP, especially when the additional data set is smaller than the original data set, and the rules would be more believable. When the additional data set is bigger, the efficient of the algorithm is lower.

The reason is that what algorithm will be selected to produce the new rules, so we will research a more efficient algorithm to create new rules in the future.
