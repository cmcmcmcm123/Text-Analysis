Intelligent Computational Argumentation for Evaluating Performance Scores in  Multi-Criteria Decision Making

ABSTRACT  Multi-Criteria decision making (MCDM), is a discipline aimed at assisting multiple stakeholders in contemplating a decision paradigm in an uncertain environment. The decision analysis to be performed involves numerous alternative positions assessed under varied criterion. A performance score is assigned for each alternative in terms of every criterion and it represents satisfaction of the criteria by that alternative. In real applications, performance scores are sometimes hard to determine and they are often subjective. We have developed an intelligent computational argumentation approach for dealing with the problem of uncertainty in resolving the subjective scores. In this approach, an argumentation tree is developed to assess a performance score for an alternative under a criterion. The argumentation takes into consideration the strength of an argument i.e. the degree of support or attack for that argument, and priorities of stake-holders. A set of fuzzy argumentation rules in a fuzzy association matrix is used to assess the indirect impact of an argument on alternatives.

Aggregation of strengths of supporting and attacking; direct and indirect arguments represents a performance score of an alternative for a criterion in the decision making domain. A decision making case study for developing a mine detection simulator is used to illustrate the method.

1.  INTRODUCTION  Multi-Criteria decision making techniques and models assist in the process of searching for decisions which best satisfy a magnitude of conflicting objectives in an absolute or an uncertain environment. Criterion outcomes for decision alternatives are represented through a  performance chart, also called a decision matrix. The decision matrix contains performance scores of different alternatives, which represent their satisfactions for different criteria. The quality of decision is directly related to that of the performance scores. Performance scores are sometimes hard to determine. There is a wide range of different opinions about their values from different stakeholders and they might become controversial in these situations.  They need an in depth analysis of different views and concerns of the stakeholders. As an example, consider a decision problem in which we have three car models from which we need to find the most favorable model in terms of cost, mileage and looks. While it is easy to find performance scores of a car model for cost and mileage, the quantitative evaluation of car models under the third criteria looks is difficult since different stakeholders may have different views about the looks of a car. A consensus may not be easily achieved in this case and a more rigorous approach is needed to find these objective scores.

To deal with the issue of uncertainty in the evaluation of performance scores, many methods make use of linguistic variables in fuzzy logic [9]. Several fuzzy logic based multi-criteria decision making methods are developed using linguistic variables for representing performance scores. They either aid in finding the most favorable alternative from among a set of various alternatives as illustrated in [4] [16] or they determine the alternative with the nearest match to an ideal solution [17]. However, these methods do not resolve the issue; that different stakeholders have different opinions about a performance score and do not help stakeholders to give objective evaluation of performance scores. Actually, many scores given by stakeholders may not be justifiable. This is why stakeholders need to provide rationales for their performance scores. In this paper, we propose to use intelligent argumentation to capture rationale of performance scores from stakeholders.

Intelligent Computational Argumentation is an effective technique for quantifying and measuring subjective factors involved in multi-criteria decision making because          it stresses the need for reaching conclusions through logical reasoning. Argumentation based decision making allows stakeholders to provide arguments and justifications as a part of decision process, which in turn increases the speed of agreements being reached.

Arguments are intended to support or attack other arguments or decision alternatives. Indeed, an argumentation based approach for collaborative decision making has the advantage of letting a stakeholder specify his views and beliefs along with reasons supporting the same. These reasons may lead their receivers to change their preferences. Consequently, an agreement may be more easily reached with such approaches, when in other approaches (where stakeholder?s preferences are fixed) consensus may be more difficult to achieve.

This paper is aimed at evaluating the subjective performance scores in an MCDM framework using intelligent computational argumentation. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a review of related work. Section 3 gives a brief overview of our previous research. Section 4 explains the technique involved in determining the performance scores through argumentation. Section 5 demonstrates a case study in which we make use of the proposed technique to select a platform for the development of mine detection training software.

2. RELATED WORK  For the purpose of this research, two paradigms had to be reviewed. Firstly, the existing techniques for the evaluation of subjective scores in Multi-Criteria decision making had to be studied. Secondly, various argumentation approaches for decision making developed so far had to be reviewed. The following sections provide some insight into the work already done in this regard.

2.1. Current State-Of-The-Art Techniques For Evaluating Performance Scores In MCDM  Multi-Criteria decision making paradigm has been supported by many mathematical models in the past.

These models evaluate performance scores for alternatives with respect to different criterion. Tsaur, Chang and Yen [16] use the fuzzy MCDM framework for evaluating airline service quality. Their implementation integrates the use of Analytic Hierarchy process (AHP) for evaluating the weights of criteria and fuzzy theory for finding out the performance scores. Wang and Lee [17] develop a fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order preference by Similarity to Ideal Situation) approach based on subjective and Objective weights. They extend the Shannon?s entropy method to measure weights in MCDM. The Shannon entropy is a measure of uncertainty  in information formulated in terms of probability theory.

Chen, Tzeng and Ding [4] also make use of fuzzy MCDM approach to ?Select a service provider?. They use the pair wise comparison technique for assessing the criteria, and a set of fuzzy linguistic terms for calculating the favorability of the alternatives.

2.2. Current State-Of-The-Art Techniques For Aiding Decision Making Using Arguments  Philosopher Stephen Toulmin developed a very influential model for argumentation that has guided the development of software tools and systems intended to support the detection and resolution of conflicts in many knowledge domains. Amgoud and Prade [1] extended the argumentation framework to define mathematical models for epistemic and practical arguments. gIBIS (graphical IBIS), represents the design dialog as a graph [5]. While being capable of representing issues, positions, and arguments, gIBIS did not support representation of goals (requirements) and outcomes. IBE [8] extended gIBIS by integrating a document editor. HERMES [14] is a system that aids decision makers to reach a decision by structuring arguments and evidences together in a hierarchy. The evidences are also arguments that are targeted to particular arguments which are in conflict or have contrasting views. The system assigns weights to the arguments and then evaluates those weights to find the closest alternative to an ideal solution. HERMES is a collaborative system which allows a real time decision making environment for participation among multiple stakeholders.

3. INTELLIGENT COMPUTATIONAL ARGUMENTATION SYSTEM  We have previously developed an intelligent computational argumentation system that allows stakeholders to determine the concerning issue, enumerate the available alternatives, and specify the arguments for those alternatives. The issue signifies a point, matter, or dispute, the decision of which is of special importance to the stakeholders. Alternative positions represent possible choices for dealing with the issue. An argument symbolizes a statement, reason, or fact for or against another argument or an alternative. The decision to be made can also be referred to as ?Strategic Decision?.

In the following sub-sections, we provide a brief description of the underlined argumentation system and fuzzy intelligence techniques applied on it.

3.1. Background  We have developed an intelligent collaborative engineering design system based on argumentation [11].The design environment supports client-server architecture. On the client side, the system provides user interfaces for solid modeling, annotation, whiteboards for design alternatives, argumentation based conflict resolution, and a chat feature for real time information exchange. On the server side, it manages client communication, concurrent access to design objects, and argumentation network.

The argumentation structure is organized as a weighted directed graph also called a dialog graph [5], as shown in figure 1.  The node denoted by circle is a Position or an Alternative and the nodes denoted by rectangles are Arguments. Arrows depict relationship either between two argument nodes or between an argument node and position. The relationship can be either an Attack or a Support. The strength of an argument is realized by the weight assigned to it. This weight symbolizes the degree of attack or support to an argument or position. The weight value is real number between -1 and 1. A positive weight value implies support and a negative weight value expresses attack. A weight of zero exhibits indecision.

For the purpose of implementing the methodology in our current system, we let the stakeholders decide the score of an argument by discussions and reaching a general agreement.

Figure 1. Position Dialog Graph   Strengths of arguments are viewed as a fuzzy set and are represented using a set of five linguistic labels. We use Strong Support, Medium Support, Indecisive, Medium Attack and Strong Attack as our linguistic labels.

A fuzzy associative matrix is developed and used alongside a fuzzy inference engine, which deal with reducing arguments to a single level and incorporating priority based reassessment for weights of an argument.

The two approaches have been discussed in the following sections.

3.2. Argumentation Reduction Using Fuzzy Inference Engine  The structure of the argumentation tree may become too large and complex to be easily understood and dealt with.

A fuzzy inference engine [11] is therefore developed to deal with this problem. It comprises of a set of 25 fuzzy rules which deal with the task of reducing the arguments to a single level. These rules assess the impacts of indirect arguments on alternative positions using fuzzy logic. The argument reduction follows a set of four general heuristic rules:  Argument Reduction Rule 1: If argument B supports argument A and argument A supports position P, then argument B supports position P.

Argument Reduction Rule 2: If argument B   attacks argument A and argument A supports position P, then argument B attacks position P.

Argument Reduction Rule 3: If argument B supports argument A and argument A attacks position P, then argument B attacks position P.

Argument Reduction Rule 4: If argument B   attacks argument A and argument A attacks position P, then argument B supports position P.

Based on the above set of heuristic rules, twenty-five fuzzy argumentation inference rules are generated. These rules are specified in a matrix called as fuzzy association memory matrix (FAM); which takes into account the five linguistic variables already defined. The fuzzy inference engine uses the fuzzy association matrix and takes two inputs to produce one output. One of the inputs is the strength of argument to be reduced and the other input is the strength of argument right above it. The output is the reduced strength of the argument. Details of the Fuzzy Association Matrix are provided in [11] and are left to the reader for further understanding.

Figure 2 shows the argumentation tree in its initial form as put in by the stakeholders and its reduced form after applying the fuzzy association rules. The labels with prefixes ?O? in the figure represent different stakeholders.

The detailed process for argumentation reduction via the fuzzy inference engine is explained in [11].

Figure 2. Argumentation Reduction   3.3. Inclusion Of Priority Of Stakeholder In Intelligent Argumentation  Priority of a stakeholder represents an authoritative rating that establishes precedence of a stakeholder over other stakeholders. Every stakeholder is assigned a priority [10] which is nothing but a value between 0 and 1. The higher the value of the priority for the stakeholder, the higher is his importance in the argumentation system. Priority is incorporated into the decision making either through weighted summation method or through priority based reassessment of argument?s strength using fuzzy logic [10]. We allow the priority of a stakeholder to be decided by the stakeholders themselves, same way as the weights of arguments are decided.

3.3.1. Weighted Summation After reducing the argumentation tree to a single level using fuzzy association matrix as explained in [11], the favorability factors of an alternative are calculated using the weighted sum of strengths of arguments and priority as follows:  Favorability =  ? ?  ? m  i ii wp     In the equation above ?wi? is the strength of an argument at the highest level achieved after reduction and ?pi? is the priority of the stakeholder who raises the argument.

3.3.2. Reassessment Of Argument?s Strength Based On Stakeholder?s Priority Reassessment of an argument?s weight using priority of a stakeholder follows a set of priority reassessment heuristic rules [10]:   General Priority Re-assessment Heuristic Rule 1: If the stakeholder specifying an argument A has a higher priority, the strength of the argument should be higher than it is.

General Priority Re-assessment Heuristic Rule 2: If the stakeholder specifying an argument A has a lower priority, the strength of the argument should be lower than it is.

A set of 3 linguistic variables are used to represent the priorities of a stakeholder. The linguistic variables used are high (H), medium (M), low (L) [10]. These 3 linguistic variables are combined with 5 linguistic variables stated in figure 2 to produce a set of 15 new heuristic rules. The detailed process for reassessment of arguments weight using priority is given in [10].

4.  ARGUMENTATION BASED PERFORMANCE SCORE EVALUATION IN MULTI CRITERIA DECISION MAKING  Argumentation can be exclusively used for evaluating those performance scores in a multi criteria decision framework for which the objective interpretation is debatable among various stakeholders. These scores are controversial in nature and require deep analysis and rigorous discussions before they can be developed into a quantifiable value. Argumentation between stakeholders provides a logical way to figure out these subjective performance scores and the scores thus obtained represent a consensus.

4.1. Argumentation Framework For Evaluating Performance Scores  The argumentation framework for multi criteria decision making involves multiple stakeholders who establish an issue to be dealt with. Issue here symbolizes a point, the decision of which determines a matter. The issue serves as a decision problem for which various considerations are laid. The Stakeholders decide the criteria set upon which the alternatives are to be analyzed. The alternative positions are evaluated against the entire criteria set and their respective performance scores are given in the decision matrix. The argumentation framework for evaluating performance scores is illustrated in figure 3.

The rectangle boxes describe the objects involved in the decision making framework whereas the tilted rectangle boxes show the input and output associated with the system. The diamond shaped box shows the possible branching condition and the arrows exhibit the possible transition between various objects.

Figure 3. The Framework   As can be deduced from the figure, we can make use of the argumentation system whenever the stakeholders cannot reach a consensus in deciding the performance scores. Figure 3 shows the criteria specific argumentation that takes place once the need for deriving performance scores through argumentation arises. Every alternative is scored against criteria in the decision matrix. The arguments are entered in to the system by the stakeholders target a specific criterion for an alternative. The argumentation input itself consists of four inputs i.e. the name of the stake holder, the argument specification, the weight of the argument and the priority of the stakeholder.

The name of the stake holder specifies the identity of the person specifying the argument. The argument is a sentence in English language which portrays the views and opinions of the stakeholder. The weight of the argument represents the degree of attack or support of that argument for that criterion.

Figure 4. Argumentation Input  Figure 4 demonstrates how the addition of an argument is handled in our present system. The input for ?Group Name? and ?User Name? correspond to a specific user and his group. The rest of the entries i.e. priority and weight are the same as discussed previously. The terms ?Alternative? and ?Position? are synonymous in the system.

4.2. Multi-Criteria Argumentation Tree Structure  Table 1 shows a sample decision matrix in which various alternatives are evaluated against different criterion. The scores specified in the decision matrix can be either ?Easily Determined? or ?Controversial?. Figure 5 shows argumentation tree that will be developed for evaluation of subjective scores for the decision matrix in Table 1.

Table 1. Sample Decision Matrix      Every criterion in Table 1 has an alternative as a child node. A detailed argumentation tree is developed for this alternative. In this way, the arguments are stated targeting this very criterion. This pin-points the arguments being stated to the highlighted matter and can extract the finer details of the concerning issue.

Figure 5. Sample Argumentation Tree   Using the above sample tree approach, we can evaluate the performance score of every alternative using the techniques of fuzzy association matrix to derive the impact of indirect arguments and aggregating the scores derived from the argumentation sub-tree with the weight of the criteria to derive the performance scores in the decision matrix.

5. CASE STUDY  As a part of our investigation, we took a project which was being implemented at the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department of Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla. The project served as an ideal platform for us to test our proposed technique because the issue involved a decision problem which was under review of concerned research team. The issue had certain evaluation criteria which were laid down by the team members themselves. Every criterion in the criterion set had a favorability factor or weight which represented the role that criteria played in deciding the winning alternative. We decided to use Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for prioritizing the criteria due to its wide use and acceptability. The alternatives to be evaluated were also proposed by the team members or more so; the stakeholders. The nature of the issue involved selecting  the most favorable alternative from the set of underlined alternatives. The alternative positions were first evaluated on the specified criteria. Each alternative was given a quantified value which indicated its degree of satisfaction for the given criterion. This score was given by stakeholders after rigorous discussions and reviews. The values were then put in the decision matrix and the favorability of all the alternatives was calculated using the sum of products of the weights of criteria and the score of an alternative with respect to that criteria. The alternative with the highest favorability score was selected. The following sections describe the steps taken to resolve the issue for this research project.

5.1. Description  The artifacts presented at the time of decision making were; the issue, the criterion set, a set of alternatives and concerned stakeholders. The subsections describe how and why the artifacts were important for decision making.

5.1.1. The Issue The issue deals with selecting a suitable software platform for developing a Mine Detection Training Software. The development of mine detection training tool is a research project supported by the US army. The project deals with simulating the real world conditions while detecting mines; into a system which could be used for training purposes. The development of this kind of a simulated tool has a lot of advantage over the previously developed systems. The systems already present for mine detection and training purposes are very basic and do not have much flexibility in terms of customization. The simulated environment for such an environment will require an efficient software tool which can display the performance of a trainee on a real time basis. The system will also support some very important functionalities like recognizing different intensities of sound generation on identification of different kinds of mines, a control panel for customizing the simulated mine field and generation of reports showing quantitative summary performance in terms of coverage rate statistics, covered area statistics and mine target location.

5.1.2. The Stakeholders The stakeholders involved in the decision process are two students from the ?Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department? who are responsible for developing the sound detection algorithm. Another stakeholder is a ?Computer Science? student responsible for developing the software tool. This software tool will help the trainer evaluate a trainee?s performance with respect to functionalities defined above. Two professors, one from Computer Science and another from Mechanical Engineering department act as stakeholders responsible          for overlooking the overall software development process and playing a crucial role in making important decisions.

5.1.3. The Criterion Set As stated earlier, criterion is the attribute for which favorability of an alternative is calculated. The criterion set defined for this case study comprises of Reusability, Meeting Operational Requirements, and Meeting Project Deadline. By reusability, we mean, the amount of reuse of different functionalities that can be achieved from the previously developed system on Mine detection training tool. Meeting operational requirements implies how effectively a desired operational capability can be satisfied by an alternative. For example, some alternative might lack a certain operational capability like database support whereas another may support it with enhanced features. Meeting project deadline stresses on the fact, whether the project requirements can be satisfactorily achieved within the stipulated deadline which in our case was around one year.

5.1.4. The Alternatives To resolve the concerned issue, the stakeholders decided to choose one software platform for developing the mine detection training tool among the three stated alternatives.

Adobe Director, Adobe Flash, Open GL were chosen as the three possible alternatives along with some justifications. Adobe Flash was chosen as one of the alternatives because; the stakeholders already had a previous developed system for mine detection developed using Adobe Flash.

Figure 6. Mine Detection System Along With Three Alternatives  One of the considerations involved here was to enhance this system rather than develop a new system from scratch. Same reason applied to choosing Adobe Director as one of the other alternatives. Open GL was picked up as one of the three alternatives in the case when a new development had to be started. Open GL is an advanced software development platform and it could have served as a good platform for the mine detection training system.

Figure 6 summarizes the project and its three alternatives positions available.

5.2. Prioritizing The Criteria  For an effective decision making, we had to weigh the criteria according to their importance in the decision making process. For this, we choose Analytic Hierarchy process because of its effectiveness in performing pair wise comparison of elements .Table 2 shows the ranking table used for comparing the two criteria.

Table 2. Criteria Comparison Table For AHP   Value aij  Comparison Description  1 Criteria i and j are of equal importance  3 Criteria i is weakly more important than j  5 Criteria i is strongly more important than j  7 Criteria i is very strongly more important than j  9 Criteria i is absolutely more important than j     Table 3. Comparison Values For Prioritizing Different Criteria    Reusability Meeting  Operational Requirements  Meeting project  Deadline  Reusability 1 1/5 3  Meeting Operational  Requirements 5 1 7  Meeting Project Deadline 1/3 1/7 1             Table 4. Normalized Criteria Comparison Table In AHP    Reusability Meeting  Operational Requirements  Meeting project  Deadline  Reusability 0.157 0.148 0.272  Meeting Operational  Requirements 0.789 0.744 0.636  Meeting Project  Deadline 0.052 0.106 0.090   Table 3 and Table 4 show the weight values of the three criterions as compared to each other using the AHP process. These weights have been decided by the stakeholders after discussions among themselves.

Average weights can be derived from Table 4 as follows: Reusability- 0.193, Meeting Operational Requirements- 0.724 Meeting Project Deadline- 0.083 These weights represent the priority of each criterion on a scale of 0 to 1.

5.3. Argumentation Tree  We develop argumentation tree for each and every alternative separately. The arguments are stated by stake holders and assembled under the alternative but they target a specific criterion. These arguments can either be supporting or attacking each other or their respective alternative nodes. We present three figures, where each figure represents the argumentation hierarchy for one alternative. Rectangular boxes represent the alternatives with the name of the alternative under it. Ovals represent the criteria with their description. The arguments are specified by labels ?A?, ?B?, ?C? for alternative ?Adobe flash?, ?Adobe Director? and ?Open GL? respectively.

Along with the labels, the arguments also have indexes associated with them. Beneath the labels are two boxes.

The box on left shows the weight of the argument whereas the box on right shows the priority of the stakeholder who specifies the argument.

Once the argument has been specified, the user enters its weight. We first reassess the weights of the arguments using priority reassessment discussed in [10].Then using the techniques specified in [11], we reduce the arguments to a single level. Finally, the weighted summation of the arguments with the criteria weights helps us evaluate the final weights for the decision matrix. It is important to  note here that, the aggregation method used for calculating the favorability is a weighted summation.

The three argumentation hierarchies for the three alternatives are presented in the Figures 7, 8, and 9. The diagrams contain arguments, their weights and the stakeholder?s priorities.

Figure 7. Argumentation Tree For Adobe Flash     Figure 8. Argumentation Tree For Adobe Director             Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL   A1-The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly.

A4.1-Flash doesn?t support database but database support is very important and critical.

A4.1.1-The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on previous records stored in the database.

A5-Flash doesn?t create sound clips.

A5.1-We don?t need sound creating features as the system has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6-Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7-The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1-We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1-The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete  B1.2- That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3- The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2- Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines.

B2.1-Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUI?s.

B2.2- A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1- We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3-The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future.

B4- Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director.

B4.1-Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs.

B5- A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash (Evidence supported) B6-If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily.

B7-The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director.

We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1-Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2-Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1-Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have.

C4-Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3-Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4-The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch.

C4.1-If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be developed faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C#.

C4.2-Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease.

C4.3-Developer has very little experience in working with Open GL platform.

For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system.

6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in Multi- Criteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work, we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness.
