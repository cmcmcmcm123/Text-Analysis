Abstract? A ?high level?, deductive-reasoning-based  (?holistic?), approach is aimed at the direct analysis of the  behavior of a system as a whole, rather than with an attempt to  understand the system?s behavior by conducting first a ?low  level?, inductive-reasoning-based, analysis of the behavior and  the contributions of the system?s elements. The holistic view on  treatment is widely accepted in medical practice, and ?holistic  health? concept upholds that all the aspects of people's needs  (psychological, physical or social), should be seen as a whole,  and that a disease is caused by the combined effect of physical,  emotional, spiritual, social and environmental imbalances.

Holistic reasoning is applied in our analysis to model the  behavior of engineering products (?species?) subjected to  various economic, marketing, and reliability ?health? factors.

Vehicular products (cars, aircraft, boats, etc.), e.g., might be  still robust enough, but could be out-of-date, or functionally  obsolete, or their further use might be viewed as unjustifiably  expensive. High-level-performance functions (HLPF) are the  essential feature of the approach. HLPFs are, in effect,  ?signatures? of the ?species? of interest. The HLPFs describe,  in a ?holistic?, and certainly in a probabilistic, way, numerous  complex multi-dependable relations among the representatives  of the ?species? under consideration.  ;umerous inter-related  ?stresses?, both actual (?physical?) and nonphysical, which  affect the probabilistic predictions are inherently being taken  into account by the HLPFs. There is no need, and might even  be counter-productive, to conduct tedious, time- and labor-  consuming experimentations and to invest significant amount  of time and resources to accumulate ?representative statistics?  to predict the governing probabilistic characteristics of the  system behavior, such as, e.g., life expectancy of a particular  type of products.

?Species? of military aircraft, commercial aircraft and private  cars have been chosen in our analysis as illustrations of the  fruitfulness of the "holistic" approach. The obtained data show  that both commercial ?species? exhibit similar ?survival  dynamics? in compare with those of the military species of  aircraft: lifetime distributions were found to be Weibull  distributions for all ?species? however for commercial vehicles,  the shape parameters were a little higher than 2, and scale  parameters were 19.8 years (aircraft) and 21.7 (cars) whereas  for military aircraft, the shape parameters were much higher  and the mean time to failure much longer. The difference  between the lifetime characteristics of the ?species? can be  attributed to the differences in the social, operational,  economic and safety-and-reliability requirements and  constraints. The obtained information can be used to make  tentative predictions for the most likely trends in the given  field of vehicular technology.  The following major conclusions  can be drawn from our analysis:  ? The suggested concept based on the use of HLPFs reflects  the current state and the general perceptions in the given field  of engineering, including aerospace technologies, and allows  for all the inherent and induced factors to be taken into  account: any type of failures, usage profiles, economic factors,  environmental conditions, etc. The concept requires only very  general input data for the entire population. There is no need  for the less available information about individual articles.

? Failure modes are not restricted to the physical type of  failures and include economic, cultural or social effects. All  possible causes, which might lead to making a decision to  terminate the use of a particular type of product, are  considered by the HLPF. The failure modes do not need to be  differentiated and their characteristics do not need to be  identified, addressed and determined.

? Practical, easy-to-use and physically meaningful algorithms  and techniques have been developed for the description of the  age distribution of the population (?species?) at the beginning  of the time period of interest, and recommendations for the  most adequate HLPF model are provided. Obtaining HLPF for  competing species may serve as an effective and a powerful tool  for comparing different trademarks, manufacturers, usage  environments or even different technologies.

? The suggested holistic approach expands the scope of the art  and science of reliability engineering and considers, in a very  general, yet practically useful, way, the philosophies and  attitudes of both the manufacturers and customers  communities. The approach can be viewed as a constituent  part of rather general and broad areas of probabilistic design  for reliability (PDfR) concept and probabilistic risk  analysis/management.

I;TRODUCTIO;  Holism (from Greek ???? holos, a word meaning all, whole, entire, total) is the idea that ?high level? properties of a system (?species?), whether physical, technical, biological, chemical, social, economic, mental, statistical, etc., cannot be satisfactorily determined, explained and described in an inductive fashion, i.e., from an ?inductive? reasoning that makes generalizations based on the behavior of the ?individuals? (component parts). In contrast, a deductive (?holistic?) reasoning should be employed to determine how the particular system of interest behaves and performs.  It is the system as a whole that determines the way how its parts behave or perform, not the other way around. The term ?holism? was coined in 1926 by Jan Smuts [1], South African and British statesman, military leader and philosopher. Smuts? concept regards objects, both animate and inanimate, as "wholes" and not merely as assemblages of elements or parts, and makes the existence of "wholes" a fundamental feature of the world.  In the analysis that follows we apply general principles of holistic reasoning to the reliability engineering field and treat a particular area of engineering, from the reliability standpoint, on a broad holistic basis of the performance of engineering objects (?species?).

The structure of the currently used reliability function aimed at the assessment of the life-time of a particular population implies, to be statistically meaningful, extensive life duration measurements for a large sample size (see, e.g., [2,3]). In many cases there is indeed a need to use an ?inductive? approach, when there is an objective to understand the roles and contributions of different factors of different nature to the general distribution of interest. This is the case, e.g., when one wants to understand the role of different underlying factors affecting a design, a phenomenon or a mission, with consideration of the roles of both technical and human factors (see, e.g., [4,5]).  There are, however, numerous situations, which, by their very nature, are just the opposite of such a situation. For high- level predictions and applications, thorough consideration of numerous impacts of a large number of stresses of different significance and of different nature might not be a must at all. Only the bottom-line, the holistic, effect is important, and it is this type of systems and situations that are addressed in the present article.  As a possible future work we are considering using the above two opposite approaches in particular reliability engineering related problems to assess how these two approaches could be combined and how they might interact.

In the present analysis we suggest an approach aimed at the evaluation of the performance (reliability) of a population, not necessarily a homogeneous one.  It might be OK to combine ?apples? with ?oranges?, as long as one is interested in the bottom-line impact of the behavior of this group of ?fruits? or perhaps in even fruits or even plants in general. We combine all these objects as ?species?.  These ?species? could be, e.g., consumer products (cell phones, cars, personal computers), or software products, or even service packages, provided that the relevant data are  obtainable and manageable. Our down-to-earth objective is to indicate some practically useful applications of the holistic approach and to suggest a way for obtaining the HLPF from the most general available data for a certain population. Particularly, the suggested approach can be used to compare the role of the human factor (the society impact) in different countries (US, Europe, Japan, Mexico, etc.) on the life expectancy of particular consumer products or the group of products. For the automotive market, for instance, one will most likely establish that the longest car life would be in Mexico and the shortest perhaps in the US, and that the life expectancy for the car population increases during the time of a recession and decreases during the periods of economic growth. One can also establish, using our high- level approach that the lifespan of a product increases with an increase in the design maturity and/or in a situation, when long term reliability of a product is predicted and assured. At the system-of-systems level our HLPF based model becomes a unique high-level measurement tool for lifecycle management (see section 8). We intend to pursue this application in our future work.

An obvious challenge has to do with the recognition and identification of different kinds of stresses that may cause the seeming, but economically meaningful, ?death? of a product, as well as with the definition of what should be considered as the end of a product's life. For instance, many still functionally good and undamaged old computer accessories that, in effect, did not fail, neither functionally nor mechanically, are often abandoned in old drawers.

These might be considered as failed products because of the appearance of more attractive innovative technical solutions.

Economic prosperity may encourage diminution of used cars in favor of new ones, or because of high cost of gasoline. The threat of high pollution might force consumers to trade in their still good conventional cars for hybrid ones.

Various healthcare related considerations and issues might lead to the avoidance of, or, on the contrary, to the preference in, use of a particular product. The imaginary or actual consequences of electromagnetic radiation, e.g., may adversely affect the cellular phone market. As far as mass- production of today?s consumer products is concerned, the human factor (human preference, ergonomics, fashion, etc.) often plays a decisive role in many nonphysical socioeconomic, cultural and social failure modes and mechanisms and their interdependencies. On the other hand, more complex products require a more general, birds-eye, holistic, view, assessment of their dependable life characteristics in terms of market survivability. This statement is true not only for some particular models or products, but for a wide collection of related applications and designs ? ?species?. This is certainly true for consumer products (household devices, laptop computers, cars, etc.), but might be also true for more complex products of public use (spaceships, satellites, aircrafts, ships, buildings, bridges, etc.), whose failure, unlike in many consumer products, is a catastrophe and might be even associated with the loss of human lives. These products are often so costly and are produced in such large quantities that their cost- effectiveness is critical [6]. This situation might also be       valid for some military objects that are produced in large quantities (shells, warheads, torpedoes, etc.). We believe that our holistic approach is particularly suitable for modern consumer markets that do not lend themselves to traditional survivability assessments: software products, insurance contracts, or various service packages.

Note that in the analysis below we use the term failure as an end-of-life event. Any repairable random malfunction during the item?s lifetime is ignored.  Hence, time-to-failure (TTF) means the time to the out-of-service condition.

2. BASIC CO;CEPT  The reliability function R(t1,t2) is defined in the reliability theory [2,3] as the probability to fulfill a certain mission during the time period [t1,t2] under prescribed, specified, predetermined conditions. This function is obtained from the probability density function f(t) for the TTF:    1 2( , ) 1 ( )  t  t  R t t f t dt= ? ?                          (1)  In the absence of prior knowledge, the function f(t) is obtained using various goodness-of-fit criteria (Pierson?s, Kolmogorov?s, etc.) from the histogram of failure times for the given population. The data are being collected throughout an experiment either at actual or at accelerated test conditions [6].  Most of the existing procedures aimed at the evaluation of the adequate reliability function suffer from a number of drawbacks. Examples are significant time and labor consumption, substantial cost ineffectiveness, the need for using oversimplified assumptions about the acceleration factors, inaccurate specifications of the environmental and operating conditions, unsubstantiated modeling of the combined action of various stresses and of the unclear intervening uncertainties, difficulties in the interpretation of the accelerated test information to make it applicable to the final products at the system level, etc.

Despite these well known drawbacks, the existing statistical methods and techniques (accelerated tests, sequential tests, Bayesian statistics, etc.) are being widely used to experimentally process, evaluate and accumulate life statistics for various populations and products [3,7,8].

Unlike the existing approaches, which require, and are based on, the statistics of the TTF for individual products in order to obtain the information reflected by the formula (1), our approach is based on the existing and even routinely recorded and, hence, well-known and readily available information (data) for the population of the species of interest. These data could be based on the periodic registration of the total amount of active objects and the delivery rate of the ?newly born? ones. Such input data automatically contain the aggregated information on the cumulative influences of all kinds of governing factors, maintenance policies, usage profiles, age distributions and a variety of human factors during the time period of interest.

From this perspective, the development and use of our holistic approach require neither appreciable financial investments, nor significant testing time, nor any stringent identification of the particular use conditions.  This  approach is based on real life observations and on usually readily available information with no prior assumptions that might be rather shaky (questionable).

For all the species, the amount of active items at the current moment of time is just the very consequence of the already occurred births and deaths of individuals. The general underlying analytical expression is sought in the form that relates the quantity of the active species' population ?(T) at  the moment of time T to the delivery rate  ( )n t? of the new  items ( t T? ). The balance equation for this situation could be accepted in the form of the homogeneous Fredholm integral equation of the first kind (see, for instance, [9-10]):  ( ) ( ) ( , ) T  ? T n t R T t dt ??  = ?? ?                        (2) Here the function R(T,t) plays the role of a suitable filter that reflects the evolutionary properties of the population: the survivability of an individual is determined by both the moment of delivery t and the current time T.

Although the reliability (performance) parameters may evolve over time, it is natural to assume that these parameters are steady-state, as long as the test-time interval is sufficiently short. In that case, the reliability (performance) depends only on the time interval, so that R(T,t)= R(T- t). A major disruption, if any, in the reliability (performance) process should be viewed as a revolutionary, catastrophic, one. This could occur, e.g., if some disruptive technologies are introduced or because of some other unpredictable, intervening, ?black swan? type, events. If this happens, newly born individuals no longer belong to, and should not be viewed as representatives of, the same species: probabilistic analyses might not be applicable to unforeseen, extraordinary, outstanding, unique situations.

Thus, the basic equation (2) could be reduced in our analysis to the equation:  ( ) ( ) ( ) T  ? T n t R T t dt ??  = ? ?? ?                    (3) where R(T-t) is the reliability function. This function is applicable to each individual, from the moment t of its delivery onward. Note that recovering R(T-t) from the equation (3), i.e. obtaining an analytical or even a numerical solution to an inverse problem [11], is not trivial at all.

Since the equation (3) is, in effect, a convolution, by applying Fourier transform to this equation one could obtain an algebraically convenient solution. This solution, however, is mostly suitable for theoretical analytic modeling rather than for practical discrete and noisy applications.

The structure of the equation (3) assumes that the needed data are available since the very beginning of history, i.e., for the entire time of interest. In a situation when the records commence at an arbitrary time threshold T0, the equation (3) should be replaced by the equation:    0 0   ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )  ( )  T T  T  T t T T T t t T t  T t  R ? ? f dt n R dt  R??  ? ? ?  ? = ? ? + ?? ? ? (4)  Here, T0 is the point in time, at which the data become          5,000  10,000  15,000  20,000  25,000  30,000  35,000  40,000  0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400  Numeric  eq. (11)  Analytic   eq. (10)  P o  p u la  ti o n B  al an  ce   Time  available, ?(T0) is the total population at the initial moment T0 ,and f(T0-t) is the probability density function for the  population age at the moment T0. The ratio )(  )(  0 tTR  tTR  ? ?  in the  integrand in the first term in (4) contains the expressions for the reliability function R in the numerator and in the  denominator. This ratio (fraction) is, in effect, the reliability function within the time interval [T0, T] and is applicable to the individuals delivered at the moment t prior to T0, provided that these individuals are still active at the time T0  [2]. The last term in (4) resembles (3).

Without any loss in the generality of the analysis, one can  assume T0=0, so that, for ?0=?(T0) and 0T t? = ? ,the equation (4) yields:   0 0  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )  ( )  T R T  ? T ? f d n t R T t dt R  ? ? ?  ?  ? + = ? ? + ? ?? ? ?  (5)  This equation can be used to recover the reliability function.

The discussion that follows suggests a mathematical  (modeling) recipe for solving the problem by using the following sequence of procedures:  (1)  Start with simplified scenarios, in which ?(T0) has no distribution of age, introducing the applicability of a numerical solution;  (2) Continue with more general cases using effective age groups as a tentative description of the unknown age  distribution of the initial population at T0; (3) Conclude with particular case studies based on, and  designed for, actual field data.

In the special case, when all the ?0 are supplied at T=0, the age distribution is a delta-function f(?)=?(0), and the  equation (5) yields:    ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) T  ? T ? R T n t R T t dt= ? + ? ?? ?                (6)  The equation (6) also holds for any possible age distribution  function f(?), when R(T) is of the exponential form, due to the memory-less property [2, pp.235], since:  0 0  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )  ( )  R T f d R T f d R T  R  ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ? ?+ ? = ? =? ?  This property is obtained when the TTF is exponentially distributed.

3. I;TRODUCTIO; OF A ;UMERICAL SOLUTIO;  The simplest illustration of how the suggested approach works can be obtained by using (6) under the assumption of  constant delivery rate ( )n t? =C. The example I in appendix  A demonstrates a non trivial analytical solution.

The above case is revisited using the MathCAD program for a sequence of numerical data (as opposite to analytical) of consecutive time units. One vector, denoted by n, contains the delivery rates. Another vector, denoted by R, refers to  the reliability function. The relationship (6) results in the  following series ?i ? the vector of the population quantity,  which contains the convolution n R? ? ??  and n0 = ?0:   i  i j i j  j  ? n R ? =  = ??    i=0,1,2...

It was arbitrarily decided to let ni be added in complete at  the end of the time unit i, where the index i indicates the upper edges of the time units along the time axis.

Expanding the series ?i we obtain the following set of equations:  0 0 0  1 0 1 1 0  2 0 2 1 1 2 0  .

? ? R  ? ? R n R  ? ? R n R n R  etc  = ?? ? = ? + ?? ?  = ? + ? + ?? ??    This set of equations may be written as:  ? R D= ? ??? ??  (7)  'D' is a squared matrix with a triangular shaped content.

Figure 1 shows that ?i of the numeric equation (7) perfectly  conjugates ?(Ti) of the analytical solution (10A) for the case addressed in the Example I in Appendix A. In this case ni  are constant for every i and the reliability function is exponential as per (A9).

In this implementation, the initial population is chosen to be ?0=10,000, the constant delivery rate is C=400 and the failure rate is ?=1/84 [1/time unit].

Figure 1 ? Population balance for constant delivery rate.

An asymptotic behavior is shown in Figure 1. This situation applies to constant delivery rates, regardless of the particular  reliability model, by solving the equation (6) for an infinite  T and T t? = ? :    ( ) ( ) ( ) T  T ? T ? R T C R d C MTTF? ? ??= ? + ? ???? ??  Here, the MTTF is the mean-time-to-failure of the species'  representatives. Figure 1 shows the special case of an exponential reliability function with MTTF=1/? and the  maximum asymptotic value of the population is 33,600.

4. BE;CHMARK FOR THE ;UMERICAL SOLUTIO;  Periodic quantitative database is likely to be recorded in a discrete manner. Hence, executing the recovery of the sought reliability function requires that the equation (7) is rewritten as:  1R ? D?= ? ?? ???  (8)  After obtaining the solution to the inverse problem, the continuous reliability function could then be adjusted to the  calculated vector by one of many well-known methods.

The relationship (8) is the general governing model. It is  necessary therefore to evaluate its accuracy by considering the associated error along the time axis. As before, the reliability function and the delivery rate function are  assumed to be known. Every newly delivered article is assigned with a random value of life duration, for which the  relevant following time units are flagged. The amount of active articles is then accumulated at each time index.

Figure 2 ? The simulation of population dynamics.

The process is illustrated by the diagram in Figure 2. The thin arrow, originated in a newly delivered article,  represents the random life duration and the gray dot flags an active state. By repeatedly executing the process, one can  find the statistical properties of the accumulated population vector.

For the demonstration of the benchmarking process, a reliability function of the Weibull distribution form is chosen:  ( )( ) exp TR T ?  ? ?  ? ? = ? ?  ? ? (9)  Here ? and ? are the scale and shape parameters,  respectively. The discrete reliability vector is given by  ( )i iR R T=  with, here, ?=230 and ?=2.

A MathCAD simulation is used for executing the process shown in Figure 2 for 100 cycles attaining 100 different population vectors.

The example II in appendix A shows some satisfying statistical behavior of the population balance applied by the  numerical solution (7), encouraging an inquiry for the validity of (8).

One hundred reliability vectors were calculated by the equation (8) for each vector of simulated random population  vectors. Utilizing the least squares method, two parameters Weibull reliability function was fitted to each vector,  deriving a pair of parameters. Figure 3 presents the  statistical dispersion measures for the pairs of the Weibull parameters ? and ?. The standard deviations found for this  case were ?? = 0.25 and ?? = 0.009 respectively and the averages are well around the given values.

In the following discussions, the uncertainties of the  parameters are defined by U? = ?2?? and U? = ?2?? with standard deviations derived from similar simulations for the relevant parameters and sample size.

5. EFFECTIVE AGE-GROUP DISTRIBUTIO; OF ?0  The previous examples deal with the cases when either the  input data are available since the emergence of the species or the entire initial population ?0 delivered at T0. However,  in case ?0 has some age distribution, its size and pattern may have an impact on the solution of the equation (5). Any  individual having aging properties, which has survived until the moment T0, has already been around for some time and, therefore, must not be considered as a newly born one.

Furthermore, the duration of that impact, before fading out, is determined by the parameters of the unknown reliability  function. To determine this function is the goal of this quest.

The problem is that no information prior to the moment T0 is  available, including the age distribution at that very moment. The following procedure can be used to reconstruct the R(T) function in accordance with the equation (5): (1) The unknown age distribution f(?) can be roughly  represented on the basis of a small number of groups,  each having an effective age and a weighing coefficient.

(2) A suitable reliability function should be presumed using some reasonable generalizations and assumptions.

(3) An iterative process should be carried out obtaining the solution for the equation (5), while adapting all the  parameters to have the calculated population values agree with the field output data.

(4) A truncating criterion should be used to control the iteration while minimizing the output error.

T0 T1 T2 T3 T4 Ti  n2  n1 N0  N0  ?  N1 N2 N3 N4 Ni  Time  S h  a p  e p  a ra  m e  te r  ?   1.97  1.98  1.99   2.01  2.02  2.03  228 229 230 231 232  Scale parameter ?         This process enables one to obtain a more sophisticated  solution to the inverse problem which ends with the resulting desired function R(T).

According to the four-step procedure outlined above, the unknown age distribution of the current ?0 may be separated to, e.g., two major effective age groups: young and old. This  rough description provides the model with tuning parameters, while the actual distribution is not of any interest. This two-group pseudo-age-distribution comprises  of three parameters, where g(young) and g(old) are the effective  ages accordingly, measured in time units, and ? is the weighing coefficient which determines the relative size of  the two age groups out of the total ?0, when 0 1?? ? .

As before, a numerical description of the equation (5) is advisable for actual use:  ( ) ( )  ( ) ( )    1( ) young old  young old  i  j i j  j  i g i g  i  g g  R R  n R R R  ? ? ? ? ? =  + + ? ?= + ?+  ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?  ?  (10)  Here, the index i is an integer where 1 i?  and Ri =R(Ti).

Let us assume now that the unknown reliability function is distributed in accordance with the Weibull law as per (9).

This assumption is believed to be realistic for most species of products, performing flexible fitting abilities for the aging phenomenon.

Hence, all the unknown parameters are set with guess values and introduced to the equation, then iteratively adapted until the deviation of ?i from the actual data is minimized.

Generally, such a multidimensional minimization problem requires a solution by a computer algorithm (see, for instance, [12]). However, as in our case studies, a manual search for the optimal values necessitated no lengthy procedure to obtain satisfying convergence.

The objective of the Example III in appendix A is to demonstrate the practicality, and the necessity, of the two- group effective age distribution. Thus, the parameters of the Weibull reliability function were set to those predetermined in the Example II, allowing the iterative manipulation of the remaining parameters only: g(young), g(old) and ?. These values are actually meaningless but successfully representing the unknown real distribution.

Note that, in reality, the reliability function is also unknown.

Evidently, the impact of wrongfully treating ?0 is not negligible, and clearly influences the deviation from the true model, although fading out after all the articles of ?0 have "died". In practice, the number of groups of effective age is preferred to be the smallest, reducing the number of the unknown parameters. We believe that for most species of consumer products, one-group or two-group effective age distributions are sufficient to represent the true, however unknown, age distribution of the population ?0 at T0.

6. CASE STUDIES ? IMPLEME;TATIO;  OF REAL FIELD DATA  Practical cases, where R(T) as well as the age distribution of ?0 are both unknown, are discussed in this section. Example IV in the appendix A presents some considerations and  regularizations for the implementation of field data by the previously outlined procedure.

The following case studies deal with different species of transportation technologies: military aircraft, commercial aircraft and private vehicles. The data is freely available on the internet. Those enable the comparison of the HLPFs given different statistical characteristics, i.e., sample size, balance dynamics and noise. Needless to note: the more statistics, the more accurate the model. For instance, a sample without "death" of articles throughout the recorded time period is not solvable.

Entry of new articles occurs at birth in all of the following case studies; other data bases with entries at different ages compel a slight modification of (5).

As an example to how the model refers to the actual data of the delivery rate and the population balance, Figure 4 exhibits monthly records of the dynamics of case study V.

The species of interest was selected to be all Private Vehicles in Israel. This case study was chosen for its dynamic data base covering 84 monthly records from January 2001 to December 2007.

We may assume that, in this case, the delivery reports always precede actual vehicles' appearance on road. This time spread was modeled by an integral filter prior to the analysis. Furthermore, from the engineering perspective, vehicles necessarily exhibit an aging phenomenon for their mechanics, and from the human perspective, users do not seem to be apathetic to the year of production. Therefore, private vehicles may be assumed to be physically aging as well as perceived as such. Hence the above justifies the reliability model of the Weibull form.

In conclusion of this case study, the best Weibull model for the reliability function of private vehicles in Israel was found to have the parameters:  ? =260.3 ? 1.3 [months];  ?=2.03 ? 0.06  Figure 6 presents the population balance: actual field data vs. calculated population vector for case study V. Note the excellent match derived by the model.

Figure 6 ?population dynamics for case V  The results of the case studies express some expected aging behavior (i.e., ?>1) which all vehicles undergo; an older vehicle is more likely to end its service life for any possible reason, however the cases differ significantly. We may point out some reasoning for the different results, having in mind that all the case studies deal with different species of transportation technologies.

The most interesting finding is the clustering of two groups of characteristics ? military aircrafts vs. commercial vehicles. The shape parameter ? of all three species of           U S A F t ra in e rs  actual calculated 17000              c o m m e rc ia l je ts  actual calculated               U S A F f ig h te rs  actual calculated              U S A F b o m b e rs  actual calculated  Case I -Fighters  Case II - Bombers  Case III -Trainers  Case IV - Jets           0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80  Months  P o  p u la  ti o n  o f  p ri  v a  te v  e h ic  le s  X    actual calculated       military aircraft is relatively high between 7.5 and 16 and the MTTF ranges from 40 to 50 years whereas for both jets and private cars it is approximately ??2 for the shape parameter and around 17 to 19 years for MTTF.

The relatively large ? and long MTTF of military aircrafts may indicate that the decision for grounding such items is motivated by a minority of dominant "stresses" which assemble a policy of the USAF leadership. These could be influenced by the cycle and high cost of new generation development programs or the response to worldwide challenges and threats. Technical malfunctions are overcome and rarely cause the fatal grounding of a military aircraft. On the other hand, the survivability of commercial vehicles responses to an entirely different set of "stresses"; the variety and multiplicity of users, of use conditions and maintenance policies and of economic conditions increase the statistical variance of the TTF and hence decreases the shape parameter. Still, it seems the physical aging of commercial vehicles has merely a partial effect in the air as well as on ground since technically they could be maintained active for decades longer than their MTTF.

This clustering is unique for the HLPF approach and it is particularly emphasized by the fact that the two species of commercial vehicles represent distinct technologies.

7. DISCUSSIO;: THE HOLISTIC APPROACH OF  THE RELIABILITY FU;CTIO;  The reliability functions found in the case studies contain all mutual product-consumer relations. They express the probability that a vehicle of a given species remains in service within a time period disregarding any specific conditions. Certainly, apart from inherent physical properties, a large variety of unpredictable environmental conditions, as well as human, economic or operational factors, determine, in combine, the time of which a private vehicle ends its term of service or a fleet of old bombers is replaced almost in a sudden. For example, private vehicles may be stricken out from records following total loss accidents, thefts or unprofitability of maintenance; fighters may retire in favor of newer ones in accordance with enemy technology development or evolving strategic missions; commercial jets are influenced by new safety demands or recession-motivated cuts as was in 2008.

Beyond the idea of snapshot description of the species' survivability characteristics, one should notice their inconstant nature. Some of the factors dynamically change over time: the percentage of ingredients of the species; military operational threats; avionic safety demands; trends in the struggle against car thefts and accidents; economic considerations etc. The notion (concept) of the continuous change in the model?s parameters over time reveals another important practical application of our approach. It is in the field of lifecycle management for species of any nature.

One can assume a particular product line or a particular technology that undergoes the well known five stages of its lifetime: introduction, growth, maturity, saturation and obsolesce. Application of our model would shed important and practically useful light on the performance of the  species of interest. For instance, deep into growth stage the model may predict long term survivability, or at the end of the maturity age it might simply apply a lower chance to survive or at the saturation stage one would notice the predicted decline in the population of the species tangible representatives towards its inexistence.  Tracking the trends in the model?s parameters may serve as beneficial continuous feedback information for lifecycle management.

8. CO;CLUSIO;S  The following major conclusions could be drawn from the carried out analysis:  ? The reliability function is the outcome of a high-level inference allowing all inherent and induced factors to be taken into account: any type of failure modes, usage profiles, environmental conditions, etc.

? Failure modes are no longer restricted to the physical type and include socioeconomic, cultural or social modes. All possible causes which may dictate the termination of a service period are made acceptable. The failure modes do not need to be differentiated and their characteristics do not need to be determined.

? High-level analysis requires only general data of the entire population and renounces the need for the less achievable information of individual articles.

? The ascription of related products to a certain species, no doubt, must bear some common sense. However, the definition of a species is flexible. Therefore, species become the object for which comparisons of service life characteristics are attained.

? In addition, practical techniques were developed for the description of the unknown age distribution of the population at the beginning of the test period and a procedure was demonstrated for the conclusion of the most adequate model of the reliability function.

Obtaining such reliability functions for competing species may serve as a powerful tool for the comparison between trademarks, manufacturers, usage environments or even technologies. The holistic approach to the reliability of species offers a wider interpretation for the reliability theory. The life characteristics, derived by this approach, are those describing the combined system of both products and users.

APPE;DIX A  Mathematical tools and examples  Example I  Constant delivery rate ? analytical solution  The simplest illustration of how the suggested approach works can be obtained under an assumption that the delivery  rate is constant ( )n t? =C. With T t? = ? , the equation (6) becomes:    ( ) ( ) ( ) T  ? T ? R T C R d? ?= ? + ? ?                    (A1) By analogy with the expectation value from the Quantum Mechanics [10], a conjugate transpose (Hermitian transpose) operator is employed to determine the quantities in both parts of the equation (A1). This yields the following:  0 0   ( ) exp( ) ( ) exp( )  C C T T  ? ?  d? T d ? R T  dT dT ?  ? ? = ? ? ?? ?  ? ?   The next integration results in the equation:  0 00 0 0  ' ' 1 ( ')  exp( ) ' ( ') exp( ) ' ' '  T T C C  T T ? ?  d? T d dT R T dT  ? dT dT  ? ?? ? ? ? ? ? = ?? ?? ? ? ?? ?? ? ? ?? ? ? ?    Hence, the reliability function is expressed as follows:  0 0 0 0    ( ) ( ) exp ( ')exp '( ) ( ) '  T ? T C C C  T T ? ? ? ?  T T dTR ?? ?= ? ?  ? ? ? ? ? ? (A2)  The equation (A2) could be verified for the case of an  exponential reliability function with the failure rate ?:  ( ) exp( )R T T?= ? ?                                   (A3)  Introducing (9A) into the equation (7A), we obtain:  0( ) exp( ) (1 exp( )) C  ? T ? T T? ? ?  = ? ? ? + ? ? ? ?       (A4)  When introducing this expression back into the equation (A2), the appropriate exponential reliability function (A3) could be easily restored.

Example II  Statistical properties of population dynamics  The delivery rate changes in time with ni representing the amount delivered at the end of the time unit i (Figure A.1a).

In this case, the initial population is ?0=0. The expected population vector for the predetermined weibull reliability  function, using equation (7), is shown in Figure A.1b. One hundred random vectors were calculated according to the  simulation process explained in Figure 2. For each time index, the average and standard deviation are calculated.

Figure A.1 ? Statistical properties of the model    The obtained results indicate that the mean error is on the order of 4 magnitudes smaller than the expected population (Figure A.1d).

Also, the standard deviation is smaller than the reasonable upper boundary ? the square root of the expected total  quantity (Figure A.1c) and the signal-to-noise ratio stabilizes around 900 (Figure A.1e).

II. The input data are the vectors of the delivery rate (Figure A.1a) and the population balance (Figure A.1b). In this case,  however, the experimentalist possesses only the data from an arbitrary moment Ti onward, and i=300. Therefore, the  preceding ?300 becomes the current ?0 and in general,  300 i? + ? i?  and 300 in + ? in . Note that the current ?0  obviously has some kind of age distribution; hence, the unknown true distribution must be effectively represented to allow obtaining a generalized numerical solution to the equation (5).

Figure A.2 demonstrates the comparison between two cases.

Figure A.2a illustrates the deviation of the calculated population from the actual data, having ?0 been wrongfully considered to have no age distribution by the formula (7), whereas Figure A.2b shows the consequence of an iterative  process based on two-group age distribution leading to the convergence of ?i ,as per (10), with the actual population  data. The expected output, i.e. the true data, is drawn by the solid line in Figure A.2. This is identical to Figure A.1b but differently scaled on the vertical axis.

The iteration process has been terminated using a visual criterion concluding the following values of the parameters:  g(young)=35 [time units], g(old)=194 [time units] and ?=0.505.

These values are actually meaningless but successfully  representing the unknown real distribution.

Figure A.2 ? Population for two age-group approach  The impact of treating ?0 wrongfully fades away after all  the articles of ?0  have "died", in this example around T800.

Example IV  The implementation of real field data  The next example, aiming at the development of actual  species' reliability model, follows a route for implementing the generic procedure outlined in section 5.

Nonetheless, useful regularizations are yet possible prior to the analysis. Introducing the data to the equation (8) while  purposely addressing the exponential reliability model enables the calculation of the species' MTTF. This  characteristic is expected to approximately maintain its value in the final model for dynamic, mass-statistics, data base. This yields the scale parameter [time units] ?  hereinafter the MTTF, which For the Weibull distribution is  expressed by ( )1 1/MTTF ? ?= ?? +  with ? as the Gamma function. This MTTF sets a valid guess value and either of the parameters ? or ? alone should be fitted. For less  dynamic data bases, particularly with no new deliveries as in the case study II, the average population age at T0, if  available, may be used as a guess value for the effective age.

Following the procedure, the first phase of the analysis  hence assumes that the age distribution of ?0 is expressed by a one-group effective age. The mathematical description  of this case is the same as in the formula (10) with 0? = .

The iterative progress in fitting the model is achieved by means of a relevant penalty (loss) function. In our analysis  the root mean square error (RMSE) was implemented. It measures the gap between the model of the equation (10) and the field actual population. The RMSE formula is:  ( ) ( )2_ _  ( ) ( ) . .

M  i model i field i  RMSE p ? p ? M d f =  = ? ?? ? ?  Where p ?  is a vector of all model parameters as per (10) and  (M-d.f.) is the number of readings minus degrees of freedom ? the model's number of parameters.

Truncating criterions are also required. They may vary subject to the quality of the data, the required accuracy or the stage of the procedure. For instance, in case that one-  group effective age model is far from converging, visual criterion may suffice to move forward to the next phase  using two-group effective age model. In other cases, the procedure may be truncated if the improvement in RMSE  value is negligible. In case the input data are most dynamic, as in the case study V, the RMSE may be compared to an  acceptable evaluation of the input fluctuations; If it is smaller than the input standard deviation, the procedure must be truncated since any seeming improvement is a mere  illusion.

The last step of the procedure examines whether the consequential model of the reliability function, with one- group effective age, is satisfactory according to the  truncating criterion. It may still be possible, however not necessary, to further modify the model by commencing a  second phase with two-group effective age distribution. At this phase, the whole procedure is performed all over again, with more unknown parameters as per (10).
