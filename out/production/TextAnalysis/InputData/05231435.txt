Extraction and Confirmation of Rules for Human Decision Making

ABSTRACT: Translating knowledge discovered from a database to the form of rule-based representation is a critical step for human decision making. In order to realize such key step, firstly, an approach of using the concept lattice to extract the association rules is proposed. Moreover, the previous extracted rules are integrated with decision maker?s subjective preference information to confirm the desirable rules set. Finally, an illustration is presented to demonstrate the above processes in detail.

I.  INTRODUCTION Generally speaking, human decision making are made on  the basis of available knowledge and the preferences of the decision maker. Therefore, knowledge and experience representation is a critical component for human decision making, how to translate knowledge discovered from data sets to the format of a rule-based system is a critical stets. As a power method for analyzing data, formal concept analysis has been extensively applied in knowledge discovery to extract rules based on the formal context of the concept lattice [1]. In addition, since the extracted rules may have multiple and conflict attributes, the optimal rules can be obtained by confirming these attributes for its usefulness of preference decision [2]. In this way, the desirable rules set can be identified grounded on the integration of the objective information which the previous extracted rules hold and the decision maker?s subjective preference information.

The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows.

Section ? discusses the extraction of rules based on the formal concept analysis. In section ?, the priority sequence of these rules will be confirmed according to the given preference information. An example is presented in section ?, followed by the conclusion.



II. RULES EXTRACTION In this section, the basic definitions of concept lattice and  the processes for extracting rules are described in detail.

A. Basic Definitions A concept lattice is formed by lots of formal concepts in  a formal context. A series of definitions of the concept lattice theory can be listed as follows [1][3][4] .

? Definition 1.  A formal context ( , , )K U A R= consists of an object setU , an attribute set A , and a relation R U A? ? . The element x of U is called the  object, and the element y of A is called the attribute.

If the object x has the attribute y , it can be written as xRy or ( , )x y R? . For X U? and Y A? , we define:    ' : { | , }X y A x X xRy= ? ? ?  ' : { | , }Y x U y Y xRy= ? ? ? ? Definition 2.  Given a pair ( , )C X Y= on the formal  context ( , , )K U A R= , if ( , )X Y satisfies with , , 'X U Y A X Y? ? = and 'Y X= , then  ( , )C X Y=  is called a formal concept, X andY are called the extent and the intent of the concept C , and the sets of all extents or intents is denoted by ( )EX C or ( )IN C , respectively. The set of all concepts of the context K is denoted by ( )L K .

? Definition 3. For any concept 1 1 1( , )C X Y= ,  2 2 2( , ) ( )C X Y L K= ? , the partial ordering relation  ? ? ? is defined as: 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2( , ) ( , ) ( )X Y X Y X X or Y Y? ? ? ? .

? Definition 4.  A decision formal context is a quintuple ( , , , , )M U W S D T= , ( , , )U W S and ( , , )U D T are the formal context, U is the object set, W or D is the attribute set of conditions or decision( W D A=? , for the formal context ( , , )K U A R= ), respectively; the relations S orT satisfy S U W? ? orT U D? ? .

? Definition 5.  For a binary formal context ( , , )K U A R= , given m objects and n attributes, constructing a m n? ( m and n are natural number) matrix B which corresponds to the formal context, ( 1, 2, ..., ; 1, 2, ..., )ijb i m j n= =  expresses  the element in ith row and jth column of the matrix, 1ijb = , if the object i   has the attribute j ;  otherwise, 0ijb = .

? Definition 6.  Given a m n?  matrix B which corresponds to the formal context, matrix 'B denotes the transpose of B , and a diagonal matrix   2= ...

n  y y  y  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ? ,( 1 2, , ... ny y y are the n  2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Application  DOI 10.1109/IFITA.2009.373   2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Application  DOI 10.1109/IFITA.2009.373   2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Application  DOI 10.1109/IFITA.2009.373   2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Application  DOI 10.1109/IFITA.2009.373   2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Application  DOI 10.1109/IFITA.2009.373   2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Application  DOI 10.1109/IFITA.2009.373   2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Applications  DOI 10.1109/IFITA.2009.373   2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Applications  DOI 10.1109/IFITA.2009.373   2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Applications  DOI 10.1109/IFITA.2009.373     attributes), let 'H B B= ? , the element ( , 1, 2, ..., )ijh i j m= of the matrix means the common  attributes which the objects i and j have; and  let { | }ijX x U xRh= ? , then ( , )ijX h is called basic concept.

? Definition 7.  Given the concept set ( )L K , a concept ( , ) ( )C X Y L K= ?  is a frequent concept if the number of its extent X  is larger than U ?? and  its intent isn?t null, contrariwise, ( , )X Y is an infrequent concept. U  is defined as the total  number of ( )L K , and ?  is the support threshold specified by the user.

? Definition 8.  Given a formal context ( , , )K U A R= and its corresponding ( )L K , the new lattice, removed the infrequent concepts (except null concept) and corrected the sub/super-concept relations, is called Pruned Concept Lattice of the context K , denoted as ( )PL K .

B.  Realization Steps In terms of the above definitions of the formal concept  analysis, the steps of rules extraction for decision making are proposed as the figure 1; the particular description of each step is as follows:  1) Creating the matrix B which corresponds to the formal context and finding out the basic concept set.

2)  Building a complete concept lattice in the form of Hass Diagram based on the basic concept set.

a)  Initializing the concept lattice which contains all objects, creating the root node of the basic concept ( , )U ? .

b)  Creating some new nodes of concepts by decreasing some objects of their interrelated higher level nodes (the parent nodes of the new nodes), and linking the new nodes to their parent nodes, i.e., the root node.

c)  Obtaining some new nodes again by decreasing some additional objects of their parent nodes which created in the above step, and linking each new node to its interrelated parent nodes.

d) Iterating the step 2.3 until the lattice contains all attributes, and creating the bottommost node of the concept ( , )A? , ultimately.

3) Dividing the attribute set of the created concept lattice into the attribute sets of conditions and decision.

4) Finding out the key concepts which contain both attributes of condition and decision making and whose parent nodes only contain the attributes of condition.

5) Based on the pruned concept lattice, specifying the support threshold ? and the confidence threshold? .

6) Computing the support i? and confidence i? for each  edge from the node of the concept ( , )i ix y  to its parent  node. According to the created concept context ( , , )K U A R= , existing the concept ( , )i ix y , ( , , 1, 2, ..., )i ix U y A i n? ? =  , the values of  the support and the confidence are /i ix U? =  and / ( )i i ix p x? = , respectively, where ix , U ,or ( )ip x is  the number of the objects in the concept ( , )i ix y , in the concept context ( , , )K U A R= , or in the parent node ( )ip x of the node of the concept ( , )i ix y , respectively.

Figure 1:  The flow chart of rules extraction  7) Comparing the support i?  and confidence i? of each edge with the specified support and confidence threshold ? and? , respectively. If i? ?? and i? ?? , then each rule can be extracted based on the edge: given the edge from the node of the concept 2 2 2( , )C X Y= to its parent  node of the concept 1 1 1( , )C X Y= , if 2? ?? and 2? ?? , then  there exists a association rule: 1 2 1( ) ( ) ( )IN C IN C IN C? ? ,  i.e., 1 2 1Y Y Y? ? .

Therefore, the association rules based on a concept lattice  can be extracted. In the next section, the extracted rules are ranked by preference decision making.



III. RULES CONFIRMATION In the multiple attributes decision making, the subjective  information provided by the decision maker can be represented by a linguistic judgment matrix and the objective information of the alternatives about their attributes can be represented by a decision matrix. The weights of attributes and raking of alternatives can be confirmed by a series of operations of the two matrices.

Given the linguistic judgment matrix [ ]ijP p n n= ? and  an alternative set { , 1, 2, ..., }iX x i n= = , ijp is the preference information provided by the decision maker, it denotes the alternatives ix  being compared with the alternative  jx ( 1, 2, ...,j n= ). If ijp S? , S denotes a previously  defined linguistic term set, there existing / 2ii tp s= , and  ij kp s= , ( )ji kNegp s= , ( )Neg i means a negation operator.

Introducing the concept of linguistic 2-tuple ( , )k ks ? ,  where ks  is a linguistic term and k?  is a numeric value  representing the symbolic translation. Let [0, ]k t? ?  be the result of an aggregation of the indices of a set of labels assessed in a linguistic term set S , the 2-tuple that expresses the equivalent information to k? is obtained with the following function [5]:  : [0, ] [ 0.5, 0.5)t S? ? ? ?  , ( ) ( ) ( , )  , [-0.5, 0.5) k k  k k k k k k  rounds k s  k ?  ? ? ? ? ?  = ? = =  = ? ? ? ? ?  (1)  where, ( )round i  is the usual rounding operation.

And there is always a function 1?? [5], it returns its equivalent numerical value from a 2-tuple:  [ 0.5, 0.5) [0, ]: S t?? ? ? ?  , 1( , )k k k ks k? ? ?  ?? = + =    (2)  Based on the above functions of ? and 1?? , the fuzzy preference relation matrix [ ]ij n nF f ?=  can be obtained  from the linguistic judgment matrix [ ]ij n nP p ?= [6]:  1 1 1( ) /( ( ) ( ( ))) , , 1,2,..., =  , , 1,2,..., ij ij ij ij  ij  Negp p p p i j n ij p i j n  f ? ? ??? ? +? ?? =?  ? ? =? =??  (3)  Given an alternative set { , 1, 2, ..., }iX x i n= = and an  attribute set { , 1, 2, ..., }jR r j m= = , n and m are natural number, the decision matrix can be denoted as [ ] , ( 0)ij n m ijU u u?= ? , where iju means the utility of the  attribute jr that pertain to the alternative ix . In order to measure all attribute values in dimensionless units and facilitate inter-attribute comparisons, the decision matrix needs to be normalized to get its normalization matrix [ ]ij n mV v ?= :  For benefit attributes:  min( , ,... )  max( , ,... ) min( , ,... ) ij j j nj  ij j j nj j j nj  u u u u v  u u u u u u 1 2  1 2 1 2  ? =  ?               (4)  For cost attributes:  max( , ,... )  max( , ,... ) min( , ,... ) j j nj ij  ij j j nj j j nj  u u u u v  u u u u u u 1 2  1 2 1 2  ? =  ?                (5)  Adopting the additive weighting method, the value ik of  an alternative ix used to be ranked can be written as:   m  i ij j j  k v ? =  = ? , 1, 2, ...,i n=                                           (6)  where 0j? ? ,  m  j j  ? =  =? , j? expresses the weight of the  attribute j .

Thus, the fuzzy preference relation ijf of ijp is an estimate of the following equation [7]:  ( )/ij i i jf k k k? +    , 1, 2, ...,i j n=                           (7)  So, the deviation degree between jpi and /( )i i jk k k+ can be written as:  ( )ij ij i j id f k k k= + ?                                                 (8)  According to the equation (8), [6] and [8] constructed the following optimization model to assess the attribute weights:   2 2min ( ) [ ( ) ]  n n n n m m  ij ij il jl l il l i j i j l l  L d f v v v? ? ? =1 =1 =1 =1 =1 =1  == + ?? ? ? ? ? ?  s.t.: 0l? ? ,  m  l l  ? =  =?                                             (9)  and the optimum weight vector ??  is written as:  1 1 1 2( , , ..., ) ( ) /( )  T T m Q e e Q e? ? ? ?  ? ? ? ? ? ?= =  s.t.: 0j? ? ? ,   m  j j  ?? =  =?                                        (10)  where, (1,1, ...,1)Te = , [ ]lh m mQ q ?= , and:     1 1 ( )( )  n n  lh ij jl ji il ij jh ji ih i j  q f v f v f v f v = =  = ? ?? ?              (11)  Therefore, the value of the alternatives used to be ranked can be obtained as:   m  i ij j j  k v ?? ? =  = ? ,  1, 2, ..., ni = .                                  (12)  In this way, the rules extracted in the section ? can be seen as the alternatives candidate to be ranked grounded on the above approach.



IV. ILLUSTRACTIVE EXAMPLE A proposed radar system for the target recognition is  presented in which the possible targets are checked to confirm their identity. The targets? tracks generated by a radar sensor are the input data which are characterized by the attributes of target instantaneous position, speed and direction. The target identification is gained through comparing some allowed values of thresholds with some target parameters. These thresholds are: the maximum speed allowed for a target passing in the area under surveillance without representing a threat situation, the minimum distance allowed between the target position and the bounds of the off-limit region. In addition, a Boolean variable denoting whether or not the target is approaching the off- limit region and a state representing War (W) or Peace (P) time are used to make the decision. In this way, the target identification is classified to three kinds: Neutral (N), Suspect (S), and Threat (T) target.

TABLE 1: THE  DECISION TABLE OF CONFIRMING TARGET TYPE  N o .

State Distance is smaller  than threshold  Approac hing the off-limit region  Speed is greater  than threshold  Target type  a b c d e f g h i j    k  W P yes no yes no yes no N S T  1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1  2 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1  3 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0  4 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0  5 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0  6 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0  7 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0  The decision control structure of classifying target based on logic rules is presented in a decision table, as the table 1.

In the table 1, the Boolean variable 0 or 1 is used to express the objective information about the conditions or actions of a decision. It is easy to see that the table 1 takes on the  decision formal context in concept lattice theory: the rows of the table are labeled by objects, columns by attributes; a Boolean variable 1 in row x and column y means that the object x has the attribute y; the attributes of  , , , , , , ,a b c d e f g h are the attributes of condition, and the attributes of , ,i j k  are the attributes of decision. Therefore, some rules can be extracted.

In terms of the table 1, the matrix B and ? that corresponds to the formal context can be obtained, and the matrix 'H B B= ? can be computed as:   =   a c e h k c e k a c h a e c e e h c e k b c e g k c e g b c e g b e b g a c h c a d f h j a j c j h f  H a e e g a j a d g e j e g j d e d j c e b c e g c j e g j b c e g j b e b g e h b e h d e b e b d e h i b d i  b g f d g b g b d i b d f g j  +++ + ++ ++ + + + ++ +++ + + +++ + + ++ + + + + + + + + + + + ++ + + + + + +++ + + + +++ + + + + + + + + ++ + + +  + + + + + + + + +  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?    So, according to the matrix H , a basic concept set can be obtained; and a concept lattice representing by the form of Hass Diagram can be created, as the figure 2.

Figure 2: The complete concept lattice  Finding out the concepts which contain both attributes of condition and decision and whose parent nodes only contain the attributes of condition. These concepts represented by the form of numerical node are the node of (7), (8), (9), (10), and (11). The values of the support and confidence of the above nodes of concepts are expressed in the table 2. We specify the support threshold i? and the confidence  threshold i?  are 0.25 and 0.5, respectively.

TABLE 2: THE SUPPORT AND CONFIDENCE VALUES OF EACH NODE  Node (7) (8) (9) (10) (11)  i? 0.667 0.667 0.667 0.5 1  i? 0.286 0.286 0.286 0.286 0.286  The extracted rules can be displayed in the table 3. In the table 3, the rules of R1, R2, and R3 have the same     consequence but different conditions of attributes, so they can be ranked grounded on the preference information of their attributes given by the decision maker.

TABLE 3: THE EXTRACTED RULES FROM THE CONCEPT LATTICE  No. Node Rule Explanation  R1 (3)?(8) {a}? {j} If during war time, the target is suspect.

R2 (4)?(9) {e,g}? {j} If Approaching the off-limit region and Speed is greater than threshold, then the target is suspect.

R3 (5)?(10) {c}? {j} If Distance is smaller than threshold, then the target is suspect.

R4 (2)?(7) {c,e}? {k} If Distance is smaller than threshold and Approaching the off-limit region, then the target is threat.

R5 (6)?(11) {b,d}? {i} If during peace time and Distance is not smaller than threshold, then the target is neutral.

Suppose the linguistic judgment matrix P of the three rules of R1, R2, and R3 and another rule R4 deriving from the rule R1 (in order to satisfy that P  is consistent with the decision matrix including four attributes) and the fuzzy preference relation matrix F as:  3 4 5 4  2 3 2 0  1 4 3 2  2 6 4 3  P  s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?  =  0.5 0.667 0.833 0.667 0.333 0.5 0.333 0 0.167 0.667 0.5 0.333 0.333 1 0.667 0.5  F  ? ? ? ? ? ?= ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?    where, 0 1 2 3 4 5 6  { , , , , , , }  S s very bad s relatively bad s bad s fair s good s relatively good s very good  = = = = = = = =  In addition, suppose four attributes of the four rules as: U = { 1u  = the state is war, 2u = distance is smaller than  threshold, 3u = approaching the off-limit region, 4u  = speed is greater than threshold}, due to the suspect target, the attributes of 1u , 2u , 3u and 4u  are all benefit attributes.

Suppose the value of each attribute ranges from 0 to 100, so the given decision matrix U and its normalization matrixV about the above four attributes are as follows:  100 28 50 30 1 0.1 1/ 6 0 40 100 46 60 0 1 0.1 3/ 7 40 40 100 80 0 0.25 1 5/ 7 60 20 40 100 1/ 3 0 0 1  U V  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?=? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ? ?  =  Based on the equations (10) and (12), the optimum weight vector ??  and the value of the rules used to be ranked are:  (0.7163, 0.0556, 0.0815, 0.1466) T?? =  (0.7354, 0.1266, 0.2001, 0.3854) T  K ?  = Therefore, the ranking order of the three extracted rules  is 1 3 2R R R . In terms of the extracted rules and the  ranking consequence of some rules, the decision maker can more rationally judge the different effect of different condition on the same consequence.



V. CONCLUSION An approach for extracting the association rules of  human decision making based on the concept lattice created from great deal of data is introduced. Furthermore, an optimal method is used to confirm the ranking consequence of the rules. In this way, both the objective information represented by the extracted rules and subjective information represented by the decision maker?s preference can be considered for human decision making to respond to the complex situation, such as time pressure, incomplete data, lack of domain knowledge, and so on.
