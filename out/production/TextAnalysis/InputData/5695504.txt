A Cluster-Based Divide-and-Conquer Genetic-Fuzzy Mining Approach for Items  with Multiple Minimum Supports

Abstract?In this paper, an enhanced efficient approach for speeding up the evolution process for finding minimum supports, membership functions and fuzzy association rules is proposed by utilizing clustering techniques. All the chromosomes use the requirement satisfaction derived only from the representative chromosomes in the clusters and from their own suitability of membership functions to calculate the fitness values. The evaluation cost can thus be greatly reduced due to the cluster-based time-saving process. The final best minimum supports and membership functions in all the populations are then gathered together for mining fuzzy association rules. Experimental results also show the efficiency of the proposed approach.

I.  INTRODUCTION Since the fuzzy theory is a well-known concept to handle  quantitative data [12, 13], lots of fuzzy data mining approaches have thus been proposed for mining rules from transactions with quantitative values [3, 9, 10]. Since the minimum supports and membership functions were assumed to be known in advance in these approaches, lots of approaches have been proposed [1, 2, 8] for deriving membership functions with a uniform minimum support in recent years.

However, different items should have different minimum supports to judge their importance. A Genetic-Fuzzy mining algorithm for items with Multiple Minimum Supports (called the GFMMS algorithm) has thus been proposed for solving it [5], firstly. The minimum supports and sets of membership functions of all the items were encoded into a chromosome.

Since the chromosome was quite long in this way, lots of processing time was spent to learn global nearly optimal solutions. A Divide-and-conquer Genetic-Fuzzy mining algorithm for items with Multiple Minimum Supports (DGFMMS) [6], which can divide-and-conquer the derivation process of the minimum supports and membership functions of different items, have been proposed. However, in that approach, the fuzzy value of large 1-itemsets should be found first before calculating the fitness value of each chromosome. Since the transactions thus must be scanned once for each chromosome to get its fitness value, the evolution process is thus time-consuming.

In this paper, by utilizing the k-means clustering technique [11], an enhanced approach, called the Cluster- based Divide-and-conquer Genetic-Fuzzy mining algorithm for items with Multiple Minimum Supports (CDGFMMS), is proposed to speed up the evaluation process and keep nearly the same quality of solutions as that in [6]. In the proposed approach, each chromosome represents a minimum support and set of membership functions for an item used in fuzzy mining. The proposed algorithm first divides the chromosomes in a population into clusters by using the k- means clustering approach. All the chromosomes then use the requirement satisfaction derived only from the representative chromosomes in the clusters and from their own suitability of membership functions to calculate the fitness values. The evaluation cost can thus be greatly reduced due to the cluster-based time-saving process. The evaluation results are then utilized to choose appropriate chromosomes for mating. The offspring then undergo recursive evolution until a good minimum support and membership functions have been obtained. Next, the obtained minimum supports and membership functions of all the items are gathered together and used to mine the fuzzy interesting association rules from the given quantitative database [15]. Experimental results also show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.



II. THE COMPONENTS OF THE PROPOSED GENETIC- FUZZY MINING APPROACH  A. Chromosome Representation Each individual consists of two parts, respectively for a  minimum support and a set of membership functions. The first part encodes the minimum support of a certain item by the real-number schema. Thus, the minimum support of an item Ij is encoded with a real number ?j. The second part handles the set of membership functions for an item. It also adopts the real-number schema. Assume the membership functions are triangular. Three parameters, cjk1, cjk2, and cjk3, are thus used to represent a membership function, denoted as Rjk, for item Ij. A chromosome of item Ij can thus be represented as a string of ?jcj11cj12cj13cj21cj22cj23?cjl1cjl2cjl3, where cjl3 = ?. The inequality condition of the center values of the membership functions is cj12 ? cj22 ? ?? cjl2. For each membership   DOI 10.1109/TAAI.2010.89     function, the inequality condition of the three parameters is cjk1 < cjk2 < cjk3.

B. Initial Population A genetic algorithm requires a population of feasible  solutions to be initialized and updated during the evolution process. As mentioned above, each individual within the population is a minimum support and a set of triangular membership functions. Each membership function corresponds to a linguistic term of an item. In this paper, the initial set of chromosomes can be generated according to the initialization information as used in [5]. It includes an appropriate number of linguistic terms, a range of possible minimum supports and a set of membership functions of each item.

C. The Required Strength of Fuzzy Regions In this paper, the minimum supports of items may be  different. It is hard to assign the values. As an alternative, the values can be determined according to the required number of rules. It is, however, very time-consuming to obtain the rules for each chromosome. Usually, a larger number of 1- itemsets will result in a larger number of all itemsets with a higher probability, which will thus usually imply more interesting association rules. The evaluation by 1-itemsets is much faster than that by all itemsets or by interesting fuzzy association rules. Using the number of large 1-itemsets can thus achieve a good trade-off between execution time and rule interestingness [8].

A criterion should thus be specified to reflect the user preference on the derived knowledge. In our previous paper [5], the Required Number of Large 1-itemsets (RNL) was thus proposed for this purpose. Given a user-defined percentage p, the RNL value for each item could be derived from the number of its linguistic terms and p. In this paper, we consider that the fuzzy value of each fuzzy region (linguistic term) directly reflects the importance of that region. The Required Strength of Fuzzy regions (RSF) is then defined here. It is the strength of fuzzy regions that a user wants to get from an item and can be defined as follows:  pfRSF n  i  l  k  i jkI  j  j *  1 1  )(?? = =  = ,  where RSFIj is the RSF value of item Ij, n is the number of transactions, lj is the number of linguistic terms of item Ij, fjk(i) is the fuzzy membership value of the k-th fuzzy region of item Ij in the i-th transaction, and p is the predefined percentage to reflect users? preference on the strength of fuzzy regions. A minimum support with which the strength of large fuzzy regions for an item is close to its RSF value is thought of as a good one for that item.

D. Fitness and Selection In order to develop a good minimum support and a set of  membership functions from an initial population, the genetic algorithm selects good parent chromosomes for mating in a probabilistic way. An evaluation function is thus needed to qualify the derived minimum support and membership functions. The fitness function of a chromosome Cq is defined as follows:  )( )(  )( q  q q CySuitabilit  CRS Cf = ,  where RS(Cq) is the requirement satisfaction defined as the closeness of the derived strength of fizzy regions of large 1- itemsets for chromosome Cq to its RSF, suitability(Cq) represents the suitability of the membership functions for Cq.

RS(Cq) is defined as follows:  ? ? ? ?  ?  ?? ? ?  ?  ?  >  ?  =  ??  ? ?  ? ?  ?  ?  ;)(, )(  ;)(, )(      LX LX  LX  LX  q  RSFXfuzzyValueif XfuzzyValue  RSF  RSFXfuzzyValueif RSF  XfuzzyValue  )RS(C   where RSF is the required strength of fuzzy regions for item Ij and fuzzyValue(X) is the fuzzy membership value of the large 1-itemset X from the given transaction database. RS(Cq) is used to reflect the closeness degree between the derived strength of fuzzy regions of large 1-itemsets and the required strength of fuzzy regions.

Suitability(Cq) represents the shape suitability of the membership functions from Cq, which consists of overlap and coverage factors. The overlap factor represents the overlapping factor of the membership functions for an item Ij in the chromosome Cq. The coverage factor represents the coverage ratio of the membership functions for item Ij. The suitability factor used in the fitness function can reduce the occurrence of the two bad kinds of membership functions, where the first one is too redundant, and the second one is too separate. The overlap factor is designed for avoiding the first bad case, and the coverage factor is for the second one.

More details can be found in [6].

E. Clustering Chromosomes From the above section, it is known that the fuzzy value  of large 1-itemsets should be found first before the requirement satisfaction for each chromosome is calculated.

The transactions must thus be scanned once for each chromosome to get its requirement satisfaction.

Since the evaluation only by fuzzy value of 1-itemsets is still time-consuming, we proposed a method based on the clustering technique to reduce the evaluation time of large 1- itemsets in the past with a uniform minimum support [4]. It first used the centers of membership function, coverage factors and overlap factors of all the chromosomes to form appropriate clusters. For each cluster, the chromosome which was the nearest to the cluster center was thus chosen as the representative chromosome to derive its fuzzy support of large 1-itemsets. All chromosomes in the same cluster then used the fuzzy support of large 1-itemsets derived from the representative chromosome as their own. Finally, each chromosome was evaluated by this fuzzy support of large 1- itemsets divided by its own suitability value.

However, each item has its own minimum support in this paper. Thus, using only the two factors (coverage factor and overlap factor) and centers of membership functions for clustering is not enough. For instance, assume there are two chromosomes with the same centers of membership     functions, coverage and overlap factors but different minimum supports. They may have different numbers of large 1-itemsets due to their different minimum supports.

The minimum supports of items should thus be considered as an additional attribute for clustering chromosomes.

Additionally, since the central values of membership functions are quantitative values, we thus normalized the center values into range [0, 1] by dividing by their maximum quantitative value in order to balance the influence of each clustering attribute. Thus, assume each item has three membership functions, six attributes including a coverage factor, a overlap factor, a minimum support value and three center values are then used to form appropriate clusters.

In this paper, the k-means clustering approach is adopted.

Since the chromosomes with similar clustering attributes will form a cluster, their shapes of membership functions will be nearly the same, thus inducing about the same fuzzy values of large 1-itemsets. For each cluster, the chromosome which is the nearest to the cluster center is thus chosen as the representative and used to derive its fuzzy values of large 1- itemsets. All chromosomes in the same cluster then use the fuzzy value of large 1-itemsets derived from the representative chromosome as their own. Finally, each chromosome is evaluated by this fuzzy value of large 1- itemsets divided by its own suitability value.

F. Genetic Operators Genetic operators are important to the success of specific  GA applications. Two genetic operators, the max-min- arithmetical (MMA) crossover proposed in [7] and the one- point mutation, are used in the genetic fuzzy mining framework. The max-min-arithmetical (MMA) crossover operator will generate four candidate chromosomes from them. The best two chromosomes of the four candidates are then chosen as the offspring.

The one-point mutation operator will add a random value ? to the minimum support ?j in a chromosome. The newly derived minimum support will thus be changed to ?j + ?. A new fuzzy membership function will also be created by addition of a random value ? to the center or to the spread of an existing linguistic term, say Rjk. Assume that cjkp represents a parameter of Rjk, the parameter of the newly derived membership function may be changed to cjkp + ? by the mutation operation. Mutation at the fuzzy membership function may, however, disrupt the order of the resulting fuzzy membership functions. These fuzzy membership functions then need rearrangement according to their center values.



III. THE PROPOSED CDGFMMS ALGORITHM The proposed cluster-based genetic-fuzzy mining  algorithm with divide-and-conquer strategy for mining minimum supports, membership functions and fuzzy association rules is described below.

INPUT: A body of n quantitative transactions, a set of m  items, a parameter k for k-means clustering, a population size P, a crossover rate Pc, a mutation rate Pm, a crossover parameter d, a percentage p  of required strength of fuzzy regions, a break threshold, an interval threshold, and a confidence threshold ?.

OUTPUT: A set of fuzzy association rules with its associated set of minimum supports and membership functions.

STEP 1: Generate m populations according to the initialization information derived by the clustering procedure stated in [5], each for an item; each individual in a population represents a possible minimum support and set of membership functions for that items.

STEP 2: Calculate the coverage and overlap factors of each chromosome. These two factors are calculated using the formulas defined in Section III.

STEP 3: Divide the chromosomes into k clusters by the k- means clustering approach based on the 3+|Ij| attributes (coverage_factor, overlap_factor, minimum support and center1, center2, ?, center|Ij| ), where |Ij| is the number of membership functions of item Ij; Find out the representative chromosome in each cluster, which is the nearest to the center.

STEP 4: Calculate the requirement satisfaction of each representative chromosome by the following substeps.

STEP 4.1: For each transaction datum Di, i = 1 to n, and for each item Ij, j = 1 to m, transfer the quantitative value vj(i) into a fuzzy set  fj(i) represented as:  ? ? ?       ?  ? +++  jl  i jl  j  i j  j  i j  R f  R f  R f )(   )(   )( 1 .... ,  using the corresponding membership functions represented by the chromosome, where Rjk is the k-th fuzzy region (term) of item Ij, fjl(i) is vj(i)?s fuzzy membership value in region Rjk, and l (= |Ij|) is the number of linguistic terms for Ij.

STEP 4.2: For each item region Rjk, calculate its scalar cardinality on the transactions as follows:  ? =  = n  i  i jkjk fcount   )( .

STEP 4.3: For each Rjk , 1 ? j ? m and 1? k ? |Ij|, check whether its countjk is larger than or equal to the minimum support threshold ? which is encoded in chromosome. If Rjk satisfies the above condition, put it in the set of large 1- itemsets (L1). That is:  L1 = {Rjk | countjk ? ?, 1 ? j ? m and 1 ? k ? | Ij | }.

STEP 4.4: Set the requirement satisfaction of each  representative chromosome using the formulas defined in Section 3.

STEP 5: Calculate the fitness value of each chromosome using the requirement satisfaction of its representative chromosome and the suitability value of its own. That is:     )( )(  )( q  q q CySuitabilit  CRS Cf = .

STEP 6: Execute the crossover operation on the population.

STEP 7: Execute the mutation operation on the population.

STEP 8: Calculate the fitness values of chromosomes by  using STEPs 2 to 5.

STEP 9: Using the selection operation to choose individuals  in each population for the next generation. Any selection operation, such as the elitism selection strategy or the roulette selection strategy may be used here.

STEP 10: If the termination criterion is not satisfied, go to Step 2; otherwise, do the next step.

STEP 11: Get the sets of minimum supports and membership functions, each of which has the highest fitness value in its population.

STEP 12: Mine fuzzy association rules from the given database using the sets of minimum supports and membership functions. The fuzzy mining algorithm proposed in [10] is then adopted to achieve this purpose.



IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS In this section, experiments were made to show the  performance of the proposed approach. A Simulated datasets with 64 items and with 10000 transactions were used in the experiments. They were implemented in Java on a personal computer with Intel Pentium IV 3.20GHz and 512MB RAM.

The initial population size P is set at 50, the crossover rate pc is set at 0.8, and the mutation rate pm is set at 0.001. The parameter d of the crossover operator is set at 0.35 according to Herrera et al.?s study [7]. The percentage of the required strength of fuzzy regions is set at 1.0.

First, experiments were made to compare the fitness convergence between the proposed approach and DGFMMS approach [6]. After 500 generations, the results are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1.  The fitness convergences of the DGFMMS approach and the proposed approach with different number of clusters.

From Figure 1, we can observe that both of them are converged after 500 generations. Besides, when the numbers of clusters are increasing, especially when it is larger than 20,  the average fitness values of the proposed approach can achieve nearly the same quality as DGFMMS approach can.

The experiments were then made to show the speed up ratio of the proposed approach when comparing with DGFMMS. The results are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2.  The speedup ratio of the proposed approach with different number of clusters.

From Figure 2, it shows the speedup ratio of DGFMMS to CDGFMMS in terms of the execution time by varying the number of clusters is from five to thirty. In summary, the proposed approach is thus efficient and effective.



V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS In this paper, we have proposed a Cluster-based Divide-  and-conquer Genetic-Fuzzy Approach with Multiple Minimum Supports (CDGFMMS) to speed up the evolution process of the approach, namely DGFMMS [6], for extracting multiple minimum supports, membership functions and fuzzy association rules from quantitative transactions. The proposed approach thus has two advantages: (1) The first one is that since the scanning database times are reduced, the evaluation cost can thus be greatly reduced due to the cluster-based time-saving process; (2) The second advantage is that although the clustering approach is utilized to estimate the fitness of each chromosome, the proposed approach (CDGFMMS) still can achieve similar results with the DGFMMS. Experimental results also show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. In the future, we will continuously attempt to enhance the genetic-fuzzy mining framework for more complex problems.
