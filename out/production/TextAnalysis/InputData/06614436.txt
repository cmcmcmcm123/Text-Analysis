On behalf of the IEEE Photonics Society, I want like to welcome you to the 2013 Summer Topical Meetings held on the beautiful Big Island of Hawaii. With more than 20 years of tradition, the IEEE Summer Topicals are the premier conferences for emerging fields in photonic science, device technologies, and applications.

The conferences are held to create the opportunity to learn about exciting new topics and to interact with the research and technology leaders in an intimate environment. This year the Topical Meetings are:  Micro- and Nano-Cavity Integrated Photonics Space-Division Multiplexing for Optical Communication Quantum Photonics & Communications Non-Reciprocal Photonic Devices Data Center Photonics  Joint technical sessions, conference panels, and the conference reception will no doubt provide an opportunity for exchange of ideas. A unique aspect of this conference series is that the Photonic Society membership propose and organize these meetings. Hence these "bottom-up" conferences seek to address exciting new research that is of interest to our members to sustain and grow new topical areas for translation of science into photonic technology. I would like to thank each of the Topical Chairs and the Program Committee Members who have volunteered and invested their time organizing these conferences.

I also want to thank the plenary and invited speakers for giving us their perspectives on the exciting new developments and the challenges in these five fields. Finally I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the Photonic Society Conference Staff for their professional organization and arrangements.

The conference is held at the Hilton Waikoloa Village, located only 20 miles from the Kona International Airport. For family or friends accompanying conference participants, there are stimulating activities available, including visiting active volcanoes, incredible snorkeling, tasty Luau, exploring native ruins, or simply enjoying the sand and sun. So I hope you will be stimulated by new device concepts, learn about emerging communication systems, and network with your colleagues. Try also to find a little time to enjoy Hawaii and work on your tan!
