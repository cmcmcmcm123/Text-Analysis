A Novel Rule-based Intrusion Detection System Using Data Mining

Abstract-Network security is becoming an increasingly important issue, since the rapid development of the Internet.

Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS), as the main security defending technique, is widely used against such malicious attacks. Data mining and machine learning technology has been extensively applied in network intrusion detection and prevention systems by discovering user behavior patterns from the network traffic data. Association rules and sequence rules are the main technique of data mining for intrusion detection. Considering the classical Apriori algorithm with bottleneck of frequent itemsets mining, we propose a Length-Decreasing Support to detect intrusion based on data mining, which is an improved Apriori algorithm.

Experiment results indicate that the proposed method is efficient.

I. INTRODUCTION  With the rapid development of electronics and information technology, computer network plays a significant role in our daily lives. However, more and more people use it as a tool for crime, and it has brought great losses to many companies and countries. So preventing these acts is on the top of our agenda. An intrusion into a computer system is any activity that violates system integrity, confidentiality, or data accessibility. In order to meet this challenge, Intrusion Detection System is being designed to protect the availability, confidentiality and integrity of critical networked information systems. [1,2,3]  In the traditional IDS based on rule detection, intrusion mode is usually pre-defined by the security experts. The advantage of this approach is that the rules can be formulated to detect specific attacks in detail. Therefore, it is guaranteed to detect known attacks and produce few false alarms. However, facing with increasing and changing network data flow, it is unrealistic to discover various intrusion modes in time. The anomaly detection is presented due to this reason. New attacks can be detected in time which the system has never seen before as they deviated from normal behavior. However, current anomaly detection schemes still suffer from a high rate of false alarms.

Therefore, currently IDS have many false alarms and redundancy alarms. As a result, understanding and handling IDS alarms become even more difficult. [4]  Using data mining technology, some useful knowledge can be discovered from network data, and invasive behavior and normal behavior rule base can be established. Then we    can divide abnormal acts from much real-time data. The rule base can be updated automatically and be identified effectively. Accordingly, it effectively reduces the false alarm rate and redundancy rate.



II. LENGTH-DECREASING SUPPORT  Association rule mining is an effective data mining method, which can extract the database features of the relationship between the items. And the knowledge will be applied to intrusion detection. Mining association rules issue is that it finds a degree of support and confidence  which is greater than user-specified minimum support S and the minimum confidence C . Apriori algorithm which is proposed by R. Agrawal and others is an influential algorithm for mining frequent itemsets for association rules. [5,6]  However, a limitation of this algorithm for generating frequent patterns is that it uses a constant support value, irrespective of the length of the discovered patterns. In general, patterns that contain only a few items will tend to be interesting if they have a high support, whereas long patterns can still be interesting even if their supports are relatively small. Unfortunately, if constant-support-based frequent pattern discovery algorithms are used to find some of the longer but infrequent patterns, they will end up generating an exponentially large number of short patterns.

In order to solve this problem, we introduce the idea of length-decreasing support constraint that helps us to find long patterns with low support as well as short patterns with high support.

A length-decreasing support constraint is given as a non-increasing function f(l) of the pattern length 1. When the length of itemsets reaches the threshold value which is given by experts, the minimum support of these itemsets is constant S, which is no longer decreased. The maximum  value of the support is f(l) , whose value is between 0 and  1, and the minimum value of the support is f(max_length),  whose value is S .  Therefore, the function f(l)  satisfies S?f(l+I)?f(l)?J .

Lemma 1 (smallest valid extension) Given itemsets x, y and their lengths are kx, ky. If X C Y and support(x)<f(kx) ,  then ky?j-l(support(x)) is essential before y potentially become the frequent itemset.

Lemma 2 (reduce infrequent itemsets) Given itemset x whose lengths is kx and support(x)<f(kx). If the  length of another itemsets y is ky and X (l Y = 0 , then the itemsets including itemset X may be frequent  when kx+ky'?f -1  (support(x? y,8j

III. RULE-BASED ALGORITHM WITH LENGTH DECREASING SUPPORT  A. Principle of the Improvement Taking into account network actIvIty, many of  intrusion or viruses are based on the variation of the original model. As we know, Red Code I and Red Code II are both worm which are attacks that propagate themselves through networks without any user intervention or interaction. They both use the flaw in Microsoft's Internet Information Services (lIS) Web server software. Code Red I cause the damage by defacing Web pages and by denying access to a specific Web site by sending it the massive amounts of data. Finally it will shut the web site down. This is known as a denial of service (DoS) attack. Code Red II is much more powerful and more damaging. The rules for SNORT to detect Code Red I and Code Red II are the following:  Alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg: "Code Red I Overflow"; content "12F646566 l756C74 2E696461 3F4E4E4EI";)?  Alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg: "Code Red II Overflow"; content: "12F646566 1756C74 2E696461 3F5858581";)?  From above ,we can see that both of Code Red I and Code Red II include the same strings"2F646566 l756C74 2E696461 ".We can consider the same strings as a known pattern.

However, although the minimum support and confidence thresholds help to exclude a large number of uninteresting rules of exploration, but still will produce some rules which users are not interested in and exclude some interesting rules. It may lead to some false alarms and redundancy alarm.

For the above reasons, we propose a rule-based algorithm with length decreasing support. It improve classic Apriori algorithm by adding a known signature sequence and length decreasing support to detect the derivative mvaSlOn.

B. Algorithm in detail Our algorithm includes elements: database D, length  decreasing support function f(k) , maximum length of itemsets max_ length, known-signatures, candidate itemsets C , frequent k-itemset Lk . To implement the  improvement, combining with an instance, the algorithm is described as following steps:   Step 1: Scan the transaction database D to analysis the items of each transaction .If an item met for the first time, it will be added into the candidate l-itemset q and the count will be set 1. When the item has been in q already, its count will be added 1. Then scanning q is to select those itemsets whose support is bigger than the min-sup fO) calculated by length decreasing support function. Thus, we get the frequent l-itemset. Then the others whose supports are bigger than f(max_length) will be saved in CL .

Table l' the transaction database D TID The list of item's id T1 iJ,i5 T2 h,i5 T3 iJ,i3,i5 T4 i2,h,i4 T5 it,i5 T6 it i2 i3,4 T7 h,4,i5 T8 i2,i3,i5  Table 2: candidate l-itemsets q itemset support  i3 6 i5 6 it 4 4 3 i2 3  We use elhptIcal functlOn as length decreasmg support function f(k). It is a non-increasing function, and it falls  slowly at the beginning. We set f(k)=a*?I-b*k2 , f(I)=O.5, max_ length=3, f(max_length)=0.25 . We can figure out  a="/351128 ,  b=5/35. So f(k)=../351128*?1-3/35*k2 and the graph of f(k) shows as Fig 1. Then minimal support of other length can be workout. We can get f(2)=0.42 , f(3)=0. 25 , f(4)=0. 25 . The support of l-itemset i3 , i5, q is bigger than fO)=0.5, so we can get Ll={i3,i5,id. Although supports of itemset i2, i4 are  smaller than fO), they both are bigger than the minimal supportf(4)=0.25.

Fig 1: decreasing function Using lemma 1, we can get the minimal length of  itemset i2, i4 is 3. So we add them into a = {?(3),ii3)} .

Step 2: Candidate 2-itemsets will be generated using  Ll. We can get a  = {i]i3,i]iS,i3is} . The minimal support of 2-itemsets is 1(2)=0.42 , so the frequent 2-itmesets  L  = {i3iS}' The supports of the other candidate itemsets i]i3,i]iS are bigger than the minimal support, so add them into CL. Using lemma 1, we can get the minimal length of  itemset ili3,ili5 is 3. Using l-itemsets in CL, we can get  CL2 = { i2i4} ' We also can know that the minimal length of itemset ii4 is 3, so add it into CL . We can get a = {i2(3),ii3)Ai3(3).itis(3)hii3)} .

Step3: Combining Ll and L2' we can get CL3. We  find itemsets meet the minimal support of 3-itemsets  ? ={i]i3is}. Then, combining Lk and itemsets in a whose minimal length is 3, we can get CL3. Using lemma  2, we could obtain new frequent itemsets i2i3i4 and add it  into L3. In the mean time, delete itemsets in CL who has  been added to L3.

Step4: Generating CL4 as above mentioned, we find  no frequent 4-itemsets. So all frequent itemsets  are {Ll,L2,L3} .

From above, we can see that i2, i4 are not frequent  items. However, those transactions shouldn't be ignored.

With the length increasing, i2i3i4 become a frequent  itemset.



IV. EXPERIMENT RESULTS  The experiment was tested on a Intel Core(TM)2 Duo Processor 2.1 GHZ with 2048 RAM running Window XP.

17 1  To evaluate the effectiveness of our improved Apriori, we use DARPA 1999 datasets as the testing data. In our experiments, the first two weeks' data are used as training data: the first week's data don't contain any attack and the second week's data contain 43 attack instances. By using known-signatures, those attacks are divided into 18 types. [9]  In Fig 2, the length of known-signatures  is Len. Len = 2 .Size of database is 5Mbytes.

Fig.2 tells us that Apriori consumes much time to scan  database. However, many of them are not useful for detecting intrusion. And we use Ll?oLk-l and LiooCL to  generate CLk. We can know that our algorithm is faster  than Apriori algorithm except the 2 - itemsets, because our algorithm should do pattern matching with the known signatures. With the length of itemset increasing, LDSApriori algorithm consumes less time than the classic Apriori algorithm.

Under the same detection rate, LDSApriori algorithm has a lower false alarm rate. During the trial, we also found that the use of a shorter characteristic curve, the detection rate is higher than long characteristic curve. In network activity, the short signature is more frequent in data flow. But it results in higher false alarm rate.



V. CONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we present a rule-based algorithm with decreasing support. It uses the known patterns to detect the unauthorized behavior attacks. By adding length decreasing support, it reduces the generation of a short pattern effectively and avoids ignoring the itemsets with low support which is interesting in the event. This algorithm has lower consumption of time and lower false alarm rate on the detection rate.
