Hypergraph Clustering Model Based on Fuzzy Frequent Itemsets Applied in Management of

Abstract?There are two shortages in usual methods for agricultural land evaluation: (1) too many manual interferences into the calculating procession; (2) the relatively large differences of partial units are concealed in certain factors. We designed a hypergraph clustering model in this paper based on fuzzy frequent itemsets to conduct the evaluation  for quality of agricultural land. The database for land units is composed with the fuzzy feature vectors. It executes the mining association rules to the fuzzy itemsets given by the definition of evaluation factors,  and analyzes the clusters with the HMETIS segmentation method, finally devises the transactions similarity function to cluster the services. With the following checking example in some region in South China, it not only determines the quality rating of each units of agricultural land, but also gives the quality description for each grade.

I. INTRODUCTION  The substance of evaluation for agricultural land management is a process of analyzing the information of agricultural land quality(production conditions), determining the evaluation criterion and hierarchizing the analysis. When applying the factor method in the agricultural land evaluation, it might be possible that the defects of a certain condition would be concealed by the advantages of some other factors, but this kind of defects could be the sill which restricts the quality of farmland.

In this paper we design a method which composes 2 steps, establishing the hypergraph model and clustering data based on hypergraph. Firstly, the transaction database is constructed from the evaluation units database. During this process, we set index description of evaluation factor as an data item, and express it as a vertex in hypergraph. The correlated items would be connected by weighted hyperedges. A hyperedge represents a relationship in the subset of evaluation units data. The weight of hyperedge shows the intensity of the relationship. Then applying the hypergraph partitioning algorithm to cluster the vertexes, and we will get the corresponding index for evaluation factors-clusters of items. Finally, these items from the cluster is used to describe the cluster which the transaction belongs.(Fig. 1)

II. THE CONSTRUCTION OF HYPERGRAPH CLUSTERING MODEL  A  Related definitions Definition1: The number of transactions which involved  itemset X in transaction database D is defined as support number, denoted as ?x. The supporting degree of itemset X  Support(x) ?x/|D| ?100  (or Support(x) ?x/|D| ) Among which |D| is the transaction number of database  D, if Support(x) is not less than minimum supporting degree(Minsupport) which set by the user, then X is called as a frequent itemset, other X is a non-frequent itemset.

Definition 2: if X and Y are itemsets, and X?Y ?, the  formula X Y is called association rules. X  and Y are the premise and conclusion of the association rules. The supporting degree of association rules X Y is the same as the itemset X Y, which denoted as:  Support(X Y) Support(X Y) The credibility of association rules X Y is denoted as Confidence(X Y) Support(X Y)/Support(X) x100%  Frequent iitenset 1  Figure 1.

We need to apply the fuzzy sets theory to create the membership function for each attribute, and change attribute data to the dimensionless items which show the monotonically increasing tendency. The continuous property membership data is divided into several intervals. Each interval composes a subset of the certain property which called a fuzzy itemset. If the supporting degree of the fuzzy itemset is higher than the setting threshold, this itemset is called a fuzzy frequent itemset. Mining the association rules according to the fuzzy frequent itemsets would be agreeable to show the fuzzy phenomena in the land quality of evaluation units.

B  Constructing the model It is assumed that there are m evaluation units of  agricultural land in a certain region n evaluation factors, the index data with multi-resource of evaluation unit i is defined as Xj j=1?n (xi1 xi2 ? xin). A membership function of each evaluation factors is established in the discussed area, which subjects to Yj=?j X j=1?n . And the value of membership from each index of factors for a evaluation unit is derived. Getting yij =?j xij Yi= yi1 yi2 ? yin is regarded as the fuzzy feature vector of evaluation unit Xi. The transaction database is composed by the fuzzy feature vectors.

For a weighted hypergraph H= V E (Fig.2), vertex set V is constituted of fuzzy itemsets, and hyperedge E is composed of fuzzy frequent itemsets. A hyperedge is expressed by a fuzzy frequent itemset, and the weight of each hyperedge is defined as the average value of all the main association rules? credibilities of the hyperedge. The main association rule is a formula which includes all the items of hyperedge and there is only one item on the right side. The way to get the main association rules will be introduced behind.



III. ASSOCIATION RULES AND THE MINING ALGORITHM  A  mining algorithm of Association rule Mining association rules is aimed at obtaining all the  association rules which satisfy the minimum supporting degree-Minsupport and the minimum credibility- Minconfidence. Firstly all the frequent itemsets in dataset D can be quickly searched according to the minimum supporting degree, then the association rules will be get from the frequent itemsets and the minimum credibility.

B  Generation of association rules After mining all the frequent itemsets in the dataset, the  strong association rules which satisfy the minimum supporting and credibility can be produced. The specific operating introductions is followed: for each frequent itemset 1 to generate all the non-empty subsets of 1, if    We get an association rule s =>(l - s) among which sup por _ count(l) is the number of transaction records which contained itemset 1 sup port _ count(s) is the number of transaction records which contained itemset s min_ conf is the threshold of minimum credibility. The association rules are directly produced by the frequent itemsets, therefore all the itemsets that involve in the rules will satisfy the threshold of minimum supporting degree.



IV. TOP-DOWN HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING ALGORITHM BASED ON HYPERGRAPH  Hypergraph partitioning algorithm HMETIS is applied in the cluster analysis which belongs to divisive hierarchical clustering methods. HMETIS is a efficient layered hypergraph partitioning algorithm. It divides the vertices of hypergraph into k parts which are roughly the same and makes the least number of hyperedges which connect different parts.

A  Item clustering-the classification of fuzzy frequent items for evaluation factors  To purify the division results, we need to eliminate meaningless classes at first. Higher quality value of class implies that the inside edge of division has a greater weight.

If the quality value of class is higher than the setting division threshold, the clusters are considered to be fine.

It is assumed that e represents a vertex set of hyperedge.

The standard for measuring whether division c is good or bad is defined as follows:    After obtaining the good division, we need to check the vertices in the division and filter those vertices which are not strong correlated with others. The vertex with high correlation value shows it has many edges which connect  ? ?? ??? ce ce eWeighteWeightcQuality 0|| )(/)()(  conf scountpor lcountpor min_ )(_sup )(_sup ?

Figure 2. the binary hypergraph of farmland evaluation based on fuzzy itemsets     with other vertices .If the correlation value of a vertex is higher than the given threshold, the vertex would be considered that it belongs to the division, or the vertices would be eliminated from the division. The correlation function of vertex v is defined as follows:  Re levancy(v, c) ?|{e | e ??c,v	e} | / |{e | e 	c} | After purifying the division by the 2 standards above, we  can get high quality division of the vertices, in other words, the clusters that fuzzy items belong.

B  Transactions cluster-evaluation units classification The hypergraph clustering model constructed in this  paper is clustering the transactions of evaluation units by clustering the items of evaluation factors. That is to say, the description of the transactions clusters can also belong with the data items of factors in the classification. And we can decide which the cluster that evaluation units belong to through computing the similarity between transactions and clusters.

V. FARMLAND QUALITY EVALUATION OF HESHAN CITY  According to the natural and economic attributes of farmland in Heshan City, we make comprehensive assessments for the farmland quality and divide the results into several grades. In this case, 10 factors are chosen to be analyzed (Table I). The land polygons act as the evaluation units which come from the land use database with the scale of 1:10000. There are 7149 evaluation units in the database.

Firstly, the membership functions of each evaluation factor are established. Then, the factor index values of all the evaluation units are substituted into the membership functions of each factor.

Therefore the membership value can be obtained according to the index value, the transaction database is successfully established.

2) Mining fuzzy frequent itemsets  K-means algorithm is applied in the cluster analysis for the membership value of evaluation factors for the threshold-type farmland transactions. The clusters? interval range is determined by the distribution of data. Fuzzy data itemsets of continuous evaluation factors are established which the number of the items is the number of clusters.

For those discrete evaluation factor, the fuzzy items are divided according their index value. Table II  Table II.

All the evaluation factors are divided into 48 fuzzy items.

Because of membership uniqueness of each index for    ? ?     ? qk  j y y  td ktj  stj sj C,0  C,1 )C,(     farmland units, the maximum possible total number of fuzzy itemsets in the transaction database would be: C16* C14* C15* C14* C14* C16* C14* C15* C17*C13 = 4838400  Assumed that the minimum supporting degree minsup=0.01. There are 15552 frequent itemsets mined by the Apriori algorithm. The credibility of main association rules can be computed.

3) Constructing the hypergraph clustering model for farmland quality evaluation based on fuzzy itemsets  Constructing a weighted hypergraph H= V E vertex set V is composed of 48 fuzzy itemsets from all evaluation factors, hyperedge E is the fuzzy frequent itemset, and the total number of the hyperedges is 15552. The weight for each hyperedge equals to the average value of all the main association rules? credibility.

Setting the evaluation results number 4 as the given cluster number, that is to say, existing a segmentation N which can evenly divide the hypergraph H into 4 relatively independent subdivisions H1 H2 H3 H4 approximately, means that there are 4 data cluster classes. We establish evaluation function f=       among which Ws  is the weight of hyperedge es E  linking vertices between different subdivisions. Then a segmentation is searched which obtaining the minimum can be function value, so that making the sum of correlation value between each subdivision to the least.

B  Cluster analysis based on fuzzy frequent itemsets 1) Item clustering  Purifying the division with the HMETIS algorithm and the standards is designed for quality and correlation function. Then we can get the clustering results for the fuzzy items of farmland quality evaluation factors. (TableIII)  TableIII.

2) Transaction clustering  The weighted similarity computing formula is applied in this part, which use the similarity between transactions to determine the cluster that evaluation unit belongs, among which the weight value is the impact weight of each evaluation factor TABLE IV . At last, substituting the property membership value of each farmland unit into the  formula, we can get the quality level of each unit. TABLE V    TABLE IV.

VI. CONCLUSIONS  The substance of target item clustering is that it definites the range or value for the factors of a certain type or level agricultural land. This kind of evaluation ideas are more in line with the characters of agricultural land use type which can avoid the defects that factors offset each other brought by the factor analysis method.

Establishing the corresponding relationship for the index range and clustering results from a certain group or some groups of correlated evaluation factors, we can fully reflect the leading role of the main evaluation factors act in determining the unit?s level. At the same time, each cluster (level) would have an explicit description which is very meaningful in the agricultural land quality evaluation and land suitability evaluation.
