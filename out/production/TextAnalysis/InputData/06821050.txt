I. INTRODUCTION  In recent years, the computer network crime activities are more and more, which bring great threat to network security. How to fight against computer crime effectively is a major concern of society. As an important means to combat computer crime, digital forensics (also known as computer forensics) has become to be an important  component for the investigation and forensics of criminal cases, especially in cases related to computer crimes.

Now email becomes to be one important mean of daily network communications. At the same time, email has also become be a tool for computer crime. Members of a criminal organization can contact with each other by email. So the investigation and evidence collection of email data is an important task for computer forensics analysis.

We mainly study the organized crime investigation for email forensics. In this paper, we proposed a method to achieve email forensics based on social network analysis (called SNA). The main goal is to find the relationship communication network corresponding to a criminal organization. Furthermore we study the structure of Criminal organization to identify core members and the relationship between them. In this way, we may be able to find more evidence clues data to provide more digital evidence.



II. RELATED WORK TO COMPUTER FORENSICS  To combat computer crime, digital forensics becomes to be an important research task. FBI of United States of laboratory set up computer forensics lab in 1984. In 1993, The IOCE (International Organization on Computer Evidence) was founded in 1995. Then many countries promulgated laws and regulations related to digital evidence and digital forensics, specially set up their government computer forensics departments.

Many famous information security companies and organizations successfully developed excellent products for  ? 1This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61300103), the Technology Innovation Platform Project of Fujian  Province(No.2009J1007), and the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (No. 2012J01265).

DOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.38    DOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.38     computer forensics. These products include Encase(Guidance company), FTK(AccessData company), X-Way(Germany X-ways company), Oxygen(Russian Oxygen company) and FBI Forensic Desktop (Australian Nuix company),etc. Some digital forensics tools also include email forensic analysis function. The existing email forensic functions mainly focus on the basic processes modules including email data collecting, email decoding and simple relationship graph drawing.



III. FORENSIC ANALYSIS OF ORGANIZED CRIME  After 911 events in United States, all national governments come to realize the significance for prevention and control of organized crime. If you ignore the purpose of their actions, organized crime network and other common social groups have the same structural characteristics.

Members in a group and their communication relationships can be seen as the basic units of social network. To prevent and combat organized crime, we not only should explore the characteristics and behavior of the criminal, but also analyze the gang organization and its structure, especially core members of it.

If the forensic analysis work of criminal organization primarily uses manual analysis, so data collection, storage, analysis and visualization would spend a lot of manpower and material resources. Social network analysis tool makes forensic analysis of criminal organization into intelligence analysis phase. We use social network analysis methods and tools to gain insight into the structure and organization mode of the criminal organization.

Social network analysis is used to analyze these networks effective theory and methods. Social network analysis can provide a set of norms and methods to analyze the structure of social relations and their properties in a social group. SNA method can be used to study forensic analysis of organized crime. Thereby the results can more effectively guide the administration of justice with technical means.

There is a lot of research work for the analysis of social groups based on SNA. Hisato Tashiro [1] studied the method for finding leadership in e mail network using betweenness  and in-degree network centralities [2] and PageRank. Haibo Wang [3] proposed an algorithm to detect the community structure in weighted email networks by deleting all the boundaries. In order to measure how much an edge could be a boundary between two communities, a composite index named mediumness is defined, which is derived from betweenness centrality. Many researchers studied the small groups and their structure in communication network, like [4,5]. In complex network research works, many researchers also use centrality method analyzed the structure of complex networks, and identify an important member of small group, like [6,7,8,9].

Some research work for criminal network analysis based on SNA occurred. The main contents of organized crime forensics based SNA method include the modeling of criminal organizations, computing organizational size, analyzing organizational structure, finding membership composition and identifying suspicious targets.

Jennifer Xu [10] developed a criminal network intelligence analysis system (called CrimeNet Explorer), which consists of four parts: network creating, network segmentation, structural analysis and network visualization.

This system uses a variety of advanced technologies, including the concept space methods and social network analysis methods, which can automatically analyze the number of criminal gangs in a criminal network and identify core criminal members.

Matthew J [11] and his team members developed a tool to build network structure of terrorist organizations (called NETEST) based Bayesian reasoning. Using the software, investigators can accurately analyze the scale of the entire criminal networks, membership, organizational structure, operational capabilities and its subgroups. The tool improves the intelligence analysis capabilities to help investigators make the right court judgments, thus effectively combat terrorism and destroy terrorist organizations.

Arizona State University Black Cyber Terrorism Research Center [12] studied extremist groups using social network analysis tools. They analyzed the activities of  ?     terrorist organizations in online forums and built social networks and organizational structure.



IV. EMAIL FORENSIC SNALYSIS FRAMEWORK  Current research work related to criminal organization communication contact focus on email communications content analysis, such as EMT and MET. The two tools mainly analyze the message traffic and mine message subject to provide decision support to investigations.

Another scholar proposed a method to mine sensitive content and message subject to identity message authentication using support vector machine learning methods [13]. But these research work for email forensics is not involved the entire system framework. It is hard to achieve comprehensive email forensic work without system framework. So study of the framework for email forensics is important to email evidence investigation. Rachid Hadjidj[14] designed and implemented a comprehensive software toolkit called IEFAF to assist investigators gather clues and evidence in an investigation forensics for email communication. The framework offers several functionalities including email storing, editing, searching, querying and email account localization. The IEFAF achieves a static forensics and analysis for email communication and has a good practical significance. But IEFAF tool can not achieve a complex mail network association analysis.

In literature [15], John Haggerty posited a framework for the forensic investigation of email data, focusing on the triage and analysis of unstructured data to identify key actors and relationships within an email network. The researchers demonstrated the applicability of the approach by applying relevant stages of the framework to the Enron email corpus.

The work is only for a specific case, but no complete theoretical framework.

Based on existing frameworks, this paper proposes a new email forensic analysis framework to solve the email dynamic relationship analysis, especially in email communication relationship and structure analysis. The new framework also achieves static forensics and analysis for email communication.

The new framework of the email forensic work is as Figure 1.

Figure. 1. Email forensics framework  The main work of framework includes email decoding, attributes extracting, searching, email communication network graph generating, data filtering, email clustering, finding suspect criminal organization and identifying core members of criminal organization.

According to this framework, we collect email data from mail clients (e.g. Foxmail, a Chinese version of the email client software). Different clients may use different mail storage file format and email accounts organizational methods. We need to find the relationship between email data files and email accounts. But also we need to separate out every single email from one email account. So we can get all the user message data. According to different mail protocol format specification (e.g. MIME, UUencode and Binhex), we can decode all messages.

For each email message, we can extract its attributes be required for email forensics, and store email attributes into the MySQL database. These attributes mainly include from address, to address, cc, subject, received, date, etc. Using these attributes, we can study and discover the relationships between multiple email accounts. And also the investigator is able to retrieve the specified email relevant to the case.

Next we construct a relationship graph of email accounts? communications, in which the vertices represent  ?     email account and a directed edge is established from a node with from address to another node with to address. The number of email between from address and to address is as the value of corresponding edge.

In the email forensics framework, it is important to find criminal organizations and their core members. We proposed filtering algorithm and clustering algorithm for email network graph, which help us to analyze email network structure and obtain more forensic clues.

The following sections of this paper describe several important functional modules for email forensics framework.



V. EMAIL NETWORK GRAPH GENERATING  For original email data set, we first have to apply subject-based and content-based filtering methods (e.g.

Bayesian algorithm) to retrieve related messages for specified cases by investigator. Then it due to store messages data needed for email forensics.

For these email data, it is a basic development work to construct the email communication network graph. With this email network graph, we can further study the criminal organizations and their core members.

In order to show the relationship between the communication relations more directly, we realize email communication network graphic using extended JUNG[16] framework.

JUNG is a software package and a support tool Java library. We extend the JUNG framework and use it to design an email relationship graph and its operation algorithms.

The steps of realizing the visualization of email relationship network graph are as follows:  1) Initialize graph G and adding vertices and edges;  2) Create a Layout objects for the corresponding graph:  Layout<String, String> layout = new CircleLayout(g);  3) Create a VisualizationViewe object;  VisualizationViewer<String,String>vv=new VisualizationViewer<String, String> (layout);  4) A visual object vv is placed in a container object and displayed. Thus, the network diagram of graph G can be drawled in the window.

The network graph G is a directed graph. Here each vertex represents an email account; an edge represents an email communication. An edge can be given a value which is the number of email communication. Using the email network graph, we can clearly identify and analyze the communication relationship between email accounts.

An email communication network graph is as follows Figure.2. Here we choose the 500 emails of the CCERT Dataset (a Chinese email dataset).

Figure. 2. An email network graph  From Figure 2, it shows the correspondence of email accounts. By dynamically selecting a special email account and dragging it to the appropriate location, we can identify the communication relationship the special account and the others more clearly.



VI. FILTERING METHOD BASED ON MINIMUM TRAFFIC  In a suspected criminal gangs, if the value of an edge is smaller, it shows the relationship of two email accounts be connected with the edge is not very close. In the case, given a communication threshold, if the value of an edge is less  ?     than the specified communication threshold, we delete the edge. Then that we can keep the email accounts vertexes be linked closely related to crime group.

The communication network graph of Figure 2 can be processed to the result as shown in Figure 3. Here the value of communication threshold is 100. In the process, we have deleted some redundant edges and related email account vertexes. As shown, the visual test result is clearer.

Figure. 3. Email network graph after filtering  From Figure 3, we can find the email accounts of more traffic. But it can be ignored the email accounts have complex communication relationship and some email accounts be concerned may be deleted. If there is such a case, it is difficult to find the real suspicious accounts. In order to find more complex communication relationship in email network, we need to use more effective clustering method.



VII. CLUSTERING ANALYSIS OF EMAIL NETWORK GRAPH BASED ON MINIMUM TRAFFIC  When the number of Email communication data is large, the email communication network shown in Figure 2 become to be very complicated. From Figure 2, we can not identify suspicious email accounts and small computer crime gangs. In order to solve this problem, we proposed a clustering method based on communication traffic. Using this method, we can cluster the email accounts and distinguish the different small groups.

The basic process of clustering is as follows:  R eturn clusterSet  C reate a set U , storing all the vertexes of G  U  is em pty?Yes  Choose a vertex v in U  N o  C reate a set Cluster, storing a cluster  C reate a queue  Add v to C luster and Q , rem oved vfrom  U  R ead a vertex vi from  the Q  , and rem ove it from  the Q  Q  is em pty?

Locate vertexis  connected to vi in G ,add to set N  N  is em pty?

Read is a vertex vn from  N  , A dd vn to Cluster, and rem ove  vn from  the N  N o  Y es  C reate a set clusterSet, storing clustering results  A dd C luster to clusterSet  N o  Y es  Figure. 4. Clustering flowchart based on minimum traffic  Using the clustering method, the email graph of figure 2 will be changed to figure 5.

Figure. 5. Email network graph after clustering  As shown in Figure 5, we found 500 email edges were clustered into 3 clusters, including one complex cluster structure and two relatively simple clusters.

VIII. CLUSTERING ANALYSIS BASED ON BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY  When the cluster has a number of edges, the edges will influence our judgments. In the case, we also need to delete the redundant edges, making the cluster more closely. How to determine which edge of the graph is the most distant relative? We will use the method based on Centrality analysis to solve this problem. Centrality analysis is one of the most important methods in social networks analysis. The centrality of a member reflects his role in the social network.

Here we use the Betweenness centrality method.

Betweenness centrality [2] is a measure of a vertex's centrality. If the value of betweenness centrality of a vertex is larger, the vertex can be an important communication vertex. It also shows that there is more communications traffic need to pass this vertex, so this vertex can be the center vertex in the small group.

Here we design an algorithm based on betweenness centrality for the cluster analysis of email graph, digging out the important members and their relationship in small groups.

The formula for calculating the betweenness centrality of the vertex i are as follows:  ? ?  ? kj jk  jk  g ig  BC )(  i ?  Here, gjk(i) is the number of the shortest path between vertex j and vertex k through the vertex i, gjk is the number of the shortest path between vertex j and vertex k .

The algorithm of calculating the weight of edge based on betweenness centrality as shown in figure 6.

IX. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  This paper proposed a comprehensive forensics solution including email network creating method, weight calculation method, graph clustering algorithm based on minimum traffic and betweenness centrality, using which to analyze a suspicious email data. Our experimental results show that these methods have good usability to email forensics for organized crime. But our studies have nothing to do with the content of the email body, limited to email attributes. Our next research work will be studying effective email forensics method for more contents of email, especially Chinese email body content.
