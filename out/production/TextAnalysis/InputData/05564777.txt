I. FOREWORD  With the rapid development of global information and the increasing of people's reliance on the network, the network has become an indispensable part of life, economic, military and other areas. At present the traditional network security theory and technology has been unable to provide reliable protection for network security. To improve the kinds of mission-critical system security effectively in the complex network environment, it is urgent to explore new theories and methods. In this context, people propose to carry out the research of Network Security Situational Awareness System in the large-scale complex networks, which integrates the various methods in the traditional network security theory such as: Attack detection, positioning and tracking, and covers the network security assessment and forecasting techniques, and pays more attention to the security situation and future trends of the network system as a whole.

Situation is a state, a trend, a whole concept. Network Security Situation Awareness refers to extract and understand the security elements which can cause the network security changed, then show and predict future trend in the large-scale network environment [I]. This calls for mining valuable information from lots of network security data in order to better analyze and forecast network situation.

The Association Rule Theory can find relation among a mass of data, while the link can reflect some the potential rules, then help us make better analysis and judgment, which has    YUMing4 Information and computer engineering college  Northeast Forestry University  Harbin, China yumingnefu@163.com  been applied in the network security field, and showed advantage that other methods can't match.

For this reason, this paper will suggest to apply association rule mining in network security situational awareness, and make the data which reflect network situation from the many aspects as network security elements, excavate, find the links and rules, and then analyze and predict current and future network state, in order to realize network security situation awareness, and help network managers better understand the network status.



II. RESEARCH AND IMPROVEMENT OF APRIORIHYBIRD  Agrawal et al proposed algorithm AIS and SETM in 1993, and put forward an improved algorithm Apriori and AprioriTid in 1994[2]. However, the study discovers that so much time has been spent on solving large itemsets by Apriori algorithm (because of multiple scans to the database), while less space required; On the contrary when using AprioriTid algorithm, which takes less time, while more space required (since NCk need to be saved when the algorithm is running).

E  ;=  0.5  --- AprioriTid  --+- Apri ori  O ?--?--?--?--?==???  *n ( MinSuppon;O.3)  Figure 1 Execution time per step of Apriori and AprioriTid  The efficiency map of algorithm Apriori and AprioriTid can be obtained by detecting the experimental data. From Figure 1, we can see that algorithm Apriori is much faster than algorithm AprioriTid on solving the frequent 2-itemsets, but a lot of the time also is consumed (relative to the time consumed on solving the K>2 frequent itemsets by the algorithm Apriori). However, AprioriTid algorithm shows its advantage on solving the K>3 frequent itemsets.

AprioriHybird algorithm is the combination of Apriori and AprioriTid. Its main idea is to use Apriori algorithm at the initial traversal, and switch to AprioriTid algorithm when NCk is suitable for memory at the end of the traverse [31.

Heuristic can be used to estimate in current traversal whether the NCk suit memory or not. At the end of current traversal, there are the candidate counts of Ck. From this point, if there is NCk, what is the size? It means that the size is L candidate CE Ck(SUpport) plus transaction quantity. If the size is small enough to be suitable for the memory, but also in the current traversal the large candidate less than the previous traversal, then converted to AprioriTid.

However, whether Apriori or AprioriTid algorithm, the numbers of candidate k-itemsets which are examined are enormous. Hash-based technology can be a good solution to this problem.

The idea of Hash-based technology: a kind of hash-based technology can be used to compress the candidate k-itemsets Ck (k>I). For example, when scanning everything in the database, and generating the frequent l-itemsets Ll from the candidate l-itemsets in C[, we can get all the 2-itemsets generated from each transaction, and then hash (or mapping) them into the buckets which have different hash table structure, and increase the bucket count. If the corresponding bucket count is lower than the support threshold, the 2- itemsets can't be frequent 2-itemsets, therefore should be removed from the candidate sets. The hash-based technology can greatly compressed the examined k-itemsets.

The specific algorithm Hash-condense 0 as follows:  ( 1 ) for all affairs tED do begin (2) for(int k = 2; k < t.size; k++) (3) S(t)k = {{i[, h, ... ik} I il E t, hE t, ... ik E t} (4) for cES(t) k do begin (5) h(c)?HIm; I/hO is Hash function, H is  bucket , k is the number of itemset , n is bucket number  (6) end (7) end (8) for( int k = 2; k < K; k++) 11K represents the  total number of hash (9) for (n =O, n < Nk, n++) do begin liNk  represents the number of bucket when hashing k itemsets  ( 10) if HIm.count < minsupport then do ( 11 ) for c E the itemsets in Him do begin  ( 12 ) insert c into Sk II Sk is candidate itemset which is deleted from Ck  (13) end (14) end  We integrate Hash-condense ( ) into the algorithm AprioriHybird, and the improved algorithm is called AprioriHybird-H, the specific description as follows:  (1) k = 0; II Flag variable, indicates the number of the current itemsets  (2) Ll = {l-itemset in the large itemsets}, Sk = Hash?  condenseO;   (3) for(k=2; Lk.l,c null; k++) do begin (4) Ck = apriori-gen(Lk.l); Iinew candidate (5) delete Sk from Ck (6) for all affairs tED do begin (7) Ct = subnet(Ck, t); lithe candidate contained in t  (8) for all candidate c E Ct do (9) c.count++; (10) end (11) Lk = {c E Ck I c.count :::: minsupport} ;  (12) NCLsize = Lcandidate CE Ck support(C) + the total number of affairs;  (13) if NCLsize < Memory capacity M /\ Ck amount< Ck-l amount then do  (14) break; II jump out of the current cycle (15) end (16) for all affairs tED do begin (17) Ct = subnet(Ck, t); II the candidate contained in t (18) if (Ct,c null) then NCk += <t.TID, Ct>; (19) end (20) for ( k  = k + 1; Lk-l ,c null; k++ )  (21) Ck = apriori-gen(L k-l); (22) delete Sk from Ck (23) NCk = null;  (24) for all entries tENCk_l do begin  (25) Ct = { c E Ck I (c-c[k]) E t. the collection of  itemsets/\(c-c[k-l])Et. the collection of itemsets  };  (26) for all candidate c E Ct do  (27) c.count++;  (28) if (Ct,c null) then NCk += <t.TID, Ct>; (29) end (30) Lk = {c E Cklc.count :::: minsupp} ; (31) end (32) Answer = the union of Lk  At the first line of the algorithm, k is designated as a mark variable which can use to indicate the current acquired item number; at the second line, in the process of acquiring Ll, while by Hash-condense( ) function finding all candidate k-itemsets that need to be removed. Doing so, scan the database at the first time will be spent more time, but there is great significance for compression of the follow-up candidate k-itemsets. Thus, overall performance of the algorithm will be improved significantly; the steps of Apriori algorithm is at (3)?(15) line, the difference is at the fifth line, that is, to delete the collection which acquired by hash and need to be remove from k-itemsets by using of algorithm Apriori, while (12)?(14) line used to detect whether NCk is suitable for memory in order to make the algorithm jump out of loop, turn to line (16); algorithm line (16)?(19) is to establish NCk in memory; the steps of AprioriTid algorithm is at (20?(31) line, the difference is the initial value of k, the current value of k plus one, that is, starting from k + 1 step to turn into the algorithm AprioriTid, and the 22nd step is the    same to the fifth step; to acquire union of all Lk is at the 32nd line, and then get the ultimate collection of all the large itemsets.



III. ALGORITHM PERFORMANCE Ev ALUA TION  We use the same data to do simulation experiments, set all kinds of support, and the results shown in Figure 2.

AprioriHybird-H algorithm uses hash-based technology to solve the problems of candidate itemset compression, while reduce the times of database scans [4]. Moreover, with the support increasing, the performance is very stable, and the time did not increase suddenly during this process. The experimental results show AprioriHybird-H algorithm is faster 2 to 3 times than Algorithm.
