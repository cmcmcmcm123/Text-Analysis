Favorable Support Threshold Recommendation for Multidimensional  Association Mining Using User Preference Ontology

Abstract  The classical algorithms for mining association rule  require the user to specify a support threshold to determine if an itemset is frequent or not.

Unfortunately, the setting of support threshold is subjective without clear standard and has great influence on the mining results. In this paper we propose an intelligent minimum support suggestion framework with the help of the user preference ontology. The user preference ontology maintains the frequently used mining queries extracted from the mining log. The system finds the most similar queries to the user?s mining intension, aggregates them and obtains the favorable support range for the user to refer. In this paper we describe briefly the construction of the user preference ontology and focus on the methodology for query similarity comparison.

1. Introduction   The Apriori algorithm for mining frequent itemset of association rules is first introduced by Agrawal and Srikant [2]. It is an influential algorithm that is based on the property that non-empty subsets of the frequent itemsets are also frequent. Whether an itemset is frequent depends on the user-specified minimum support. In general, an association mining finds the frequent itemsets that satisfy the minimum support first, then the association rules are derived based on the frequent itemsets that satisfy the minimum confidence.

Suppose that A and B are sets of items and A ? B = ?.

An association rule has the form A ? B with support and confidence. The support is the possibility of the transactions that contain the itemset A?B, which is  P(A?B). The confidence is the possibility of the transactions that contain A also contain B, which is P(B|A).

The challenge is that the settings of minimum support and minimum confidence have no clear-cut standard. Different minimum support settings will discover different numbers of frequent itemsets, hence influence the rules mined. If the minimum support is set too low, numerous frequent itemsets will be discovered, thus also numerous rules are generated and leave the users challenges in order to recognize the real useful knowledge. If minimum support is set too high, very few frequent itemsets can be found, thus some useful knowledge might be left out. Thus reasonable settings of minimum support and minimum confidence are important in order to find useful knowledge. Users try the settings of minimum support and minimum confidence to and fro to converge on a favorable set when they are satisfied. Fayyad et al. [3] described data mining as a repetitive sequence of searching processes, which implies that the efficiency of mining process depends much on the proper setting of a mining query which includes the settings of the minimum support and confidence.

When the association rule mining is first introduced, it implied typically on the retailer?s basket data, that is, it focuses on the purchase analysis which discovers the associations among solely the product dimension.

Later in [5][6][11], multidimensional association mining from data cube or multi-dimensional data warehouse has been proposed. Multiple dimensions are allowed and the users can specify more precisely the target data for mining via setting the data granularity with optional filtering condition. Thus the query for a multidimensional association mining is robotic that the rules mined tend to be closer to what the user wants.

Yet, it is a challenge for an inexperienced user to formulate an effective query, especially on the settings of reasonable thresholds.

In this paper, we propose an intelligent suggestion framework of the minimum support with the help of the user preference ontology when the user is formulating a query for multidimensional association mining. The user preference ontology maintains the frequently used queries extracted from the mining log.

It presents assorted users mining experiences hence benefits the users, especially inexperienced ones, by providing them with useful information. Through computing the similarity between the user-specified query and the queries in the user preference ontology, the system finds the most similar queries to the user?s mining intension. Support thresholds from those queries are being computed and the favorable minimum support can be derived and provided to the user. Originally the setting of the support threshold in the association rule mining is subject to the individual user?s subjectivity. In this way, the user?s subjectivity shall include extra knowledge of abundant other users? experiences. The try-and-error process can be improved while formulating a mining query. The mining results are more effective and easier to be closer to the user?s need.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

Section 2 introduces the multidimensional association mining. Section 3 presents the architecture of the user preference ontology. Section 4 describes the proposed intelligent suggestion framework. Section 5 summarizes related work and section 6 provides the conclusions and future work.

2. Multidimensional association mining   A multidimensional association rule is an  association rule that involves one or more dimensions (attributes). The mining meta-pattern of a multidimensional association mining query is defined as follows:  MP: ?tG, tM, [wc], ms, mc?  where tG, tM, wc, ms and mc are components of a query, described below:  tG: the set of transaction ID (data granularity), tM: the set of interested mining attributes, wc: the optional ?where? condition(s), ms: the minimum support and mc: the minimum confidence.

Following is an example query of a multidimensional association mining:  tM: ProdName, Age  tG: CustID, Date wc: Country=?Japan? ms: 65% mc: 86%  It shows the user?s mining intension that he/she wants to learn the associations between customers of different age levels and daily purchase of products in Japan with minimum support 65% and minimum confidence 86%. The target mining data set is as shown in Table 1. The transaction IDs tG = {CustID, Date} and the interested mining attributes tM = {Age, ProdName}.

Table 1. The target mining data set tid tG tM  CustID Date Age *ProdName 1 C001 2009-02-01 20-30 B, E 2 C002 2009-02-03 40-50 A, B, C,E 3 C002 2009-02-10 40-50 A,C,D 4 C003 2009-02-05 30-40 B,C,E 5 C004 2009-02-09 40-50 B,E 6 C004 2009-02-15 40-50 A, E  *A: IBM60GB   B: IBM TP  C: RAM 512MB D: Ink Cartridge   E: Hard Disk  A multidimensional association mining is initiated  by the user?s formulation of a query. The action of the mining engine is triggered when it receives the submission of the user defined query.  When the user receives the mining results, he or she determines subjectively whether the results are acceptable. If it is negative, the mining query will be adjusted and the process will be re-run again until the user achieves the acceptable results.

3. The user preference ontology   In the proposed framework, we assume that for each successful mining process by assorted users especially by the experienced users, the mining query is recorded in the mining log. The mining log is too tedious to be utilized in the mechanism we are proposing. It will increase the calculation cost while trying to retrieve queries from the user preference ontology that are similar to the user specified one.

Thus distillation for representative queries from the mining log is necessary. The user preference ontology contains the representatives of frequently used queries in the mining log. The query distillation process involves the following steps as shown in Figure 1:  1. Find the query patterns of the meta rule format ?tG ? tM?, which indicates that the tG and tM tend to be used together under certain threshold.

2. Cluster the close related query patterns in step 1 and derive a surrogate query patterns;    3. Find the ?where? attribute patterns of the meta rule format ?tG, tM ? wca?, from the mining log with the surrogate query patterns in step 2. This indicates that the surrogate query patterns and the attributes of the ?where? condition (wca) are likely to be used together, under certain threshold.

4. Cluster the ?where? conditions in the mining log that have the ?where? attribute patterns in step 3 and derive a surrogate ?where? conditions;  5. Generate the surrogate queries by combining the surrogate query patterns and the surrogate ?where? condition (wc);  6. Calculate the minimum support and minimum confidence for the surrogate queries by averaging the original queries that are related to the surrogate queries.

Figure 1. The distillation process   The rules discovered by a surrogate query will  include the rules that are discovered by the queries covered by the surrogate query. The surrogate queries are structured and stored in the user preference ontology as shown in Figure 2. The attribute index provides fast access to tG and tM by connecting the attribute to the corresponding tG and tM. A surrogate query is presented as a path in the user preference ontology. The user preference ontology is structured with hierarchies in tG ? tM ? wc. It collects surrogate queries that are relatively used often before. The user preference ontology will be re-built automatically while the mining log is growing over a certain threshold.

4. The intelligent recommendation of minimum support   This section presents the intelligent suggestion  mechanism for minimum support. First we will introduce the mining system framework and second, the details of the mechanism for the minimum support suggestion will be provided.

Figure 2. The user preference ontology  4.1. The intelligent suggestion framework   The intelligent suggestion framework with the user preference ontology is shown in Figure 3. A multidimensional association mining of data warehouse starts from the query formulation by a user.

The mining engine runs the query the user has defined and the resulting rules are sent back to the users. The successful queries are maintained in the mining log.

The user preference ontology is generated from the mining log by performing the distillation process as described in the previous section. The minimum support suggestion module is responsible for providing a favorable minimum support range to the user interactively while a user is formulating a query. It computes the similarities between the user specified query and the surrogate queries in the user preference ontology and recommends a reasonable support range to the users.

Our strategy for suggesting a reasonable range of minimum support is taking the experience value from the user preference ontology, which contains the experienced users? intelligence. The similarity checking of two queries is essential in order to obtain the favorable minimum support range from the user preference ontology. Specifically, the tG, tM and/or wc, formulated by a user, will be checked against the queries in the user preference ontology for similarity.

The matching degree of tG, tM and wc are computed in different ways respectively and aggregated thereafter to obtain the degree of query similarity. Then the range of minimum support to suggest to the users is derived from the top N queries that are similar to the tG, tM and/or wc of the user formulated query. The computational details are described in the following.

4.2.1. Matching transaction ID (tG). Let Ga be the tG formulated by users and Gb be the tG from the user preference ontology, respectively. Suppose Ga = {ga1, ga2, ?, gai} and Gb = {gb1, gb2, ?, gbj}. dist(gax) and dist(gbw) denote the domain cardinality of attribute gax and gbw, respectively, where 1 ? x ? i, 1 ? w ? j. The computation of the matching weight, TG, of each gax and gbw in Ga and Gb is defined as follows:  TG(gax, gbw) =  ? ?  ? ?  ?  otherwise gdistgdist gdistgdist  iprelationsh alhierarchic no have g ,g If  bwax  bwax  bwax  ))(),(max( ))(),(min(    The similarity of Ga and Gb, matchG(Ga, Gb), is computed as follows:  matchG(Ga, Gb)  = ba  i  x  j  w bwaxG  GG  ggT  ?  ?? = =1 1  ),(   For example, let  Ga = {Cust_ID, Date} Gb = {Cust_ID, Month}, Date and Month has hierarchical relationship, dist(Cust_ID) = 450, dist(Date) = 365 and dist(Month)=12.

Thus, matchG({Cust_ID, Date}, {Cust_ID, Month}) is computed as follows:  )12,365max( )12,365min(00  )450,450max( )450,450min(  ?  +++   4.2.2. Matching interested mining attributes (tM).

Let Ma and Mb be the tM formulated by a user and tM from the user preference ontology, respectively.

Suppose Ma = {ma1, ma2,?, mai} and Mb = {mb1, mb2, ?mbj}. The similarity of Ma and Mb is defined as follows:  matchM (Ma, Mb)= ba  ba  MM MM  ? ?  For example, let  Ma = {ProdName, Education} and Mb = {ProdName, City, Age}.

Then matchM({ProdName, Education}, {ProdName, City, Age}) is:   },,{},{ },,{},{  = ? ?  AgeCityodNamePrEducationodNamePr AgeCityodNamePrEducationodNamePr  4.2.3. Matching ?where? condition (wc). The format of a ?where? condition is  Where: (conditional expression) [, (conditional expression)]?[, (conditional expression)].

The format of a conditional expression is  (Attribute Name)  Op (Value),  where Op ? {?, ?, =, ?} is the relational operator.

For example,  Where: Country = ?Italy?, Sex = ?Female?.

It confines the data to Italian female. From the content of the ?where? condition, two similarity matches have to be considered. First is the attribute matching and second is the value matching.

(1) Attribute matching. The attribute match of a ?where? condition is computed in the same way as the matching of the interested mining attribute. Suppose WAa is the set of attribute(s) in the wc formulated by users and WAb is the set of attribute(s) in the wc from the user preference ontology respectively. Suppose WAa = {waa1, waa2,?, waai} and WAb = {wab1, wab2, ?, wabj}. The similarity of WAa and WAb is defined as follows:  matchWA (WAa, WAb)= ba  ba  WAWA WAWA  ? ?  (2) Value matching. Let Wa be the wc formulated by the user and Wb be the wc from the user preference ontology. Suppose Wa = {wca1, wca2,?, wcai} and Wb = {wcb1, wcb2,?, wcbj}, where wcax = waax Opax vax and wcbz = wabz Opbz vbz, 1 ? x ? i, 1 ? z ? j. waax is the    attribute,  Opax is the relational operator while vax and vbz denote the ?value? of the conditional expression.

To compute V, the matching degree of the ?values? in conditional expressions, we consider the following cases:  case 1: wcax = wcbz, V = 1; case 2: waax ? wabz, V = 0; case 3: waax = wabz and (Opax ? Opbz or vax ? vbz), V = CV;  The computation of CV, the complex conditional ?value?, is defined as follows:  CV(wcax, wcbz) = ? ?  ? ?  ?  ?  ??  ?  ??   )( axwadist  dist(waax) denotes the counts of distinct values within waax. The numerator is the overlapping degree of the ?values? in the conditional expressions between wcax and wcbz.

),max( bzbzaxax vOpvOp=? ),min( bzbzaxax vOpvOp=  The values of ? and ? depend on the relational operators. The sequence of relational operators are not important, thus their cardinalities are as shown in Table 2. Table 2 shows all cases of ? and ? while waax = wabz..

Table 2. All cases of ? and ? Op1 Op2 ? ?  ? ? min(vle , v<le) 0 ? ? dist(waax) max(vge ,v ge) = = 0 0 ? ? dist(waax) - 2 0 = ? 0 0  ? = 1   if veq > v ge  0   if veq < v ge  ? ? vge -1  if vne > vge  vge       if vne < vge v ge  ? = 1   if veq < vle 0   if veq > vle  ? ? vle        if vne > vle vle -1   if vne< vle  ? ? vle - v ge    if vle>vge 0       otherwise 0  subscript notation of v: ? le, ? ge, = eq, ? ne  v with an notation in the subscript denotes the  ?value? of a conditional expression that has the corresponding operator.

The matching degree of the conditional ?values? is defined as follows:  matchW (Wa, Wb) = ),(  ),( 1 1  bzaxWA  i  x  j  z bzax  wawamatch  wcwcV?? = =  For example, let  Wa= Age < 60-70, Wb= Age > 20-30, Salary > 50000,  Suppose Age has 10 distinct range values. Then,  matchW (Wa, Wb) = 5.0  04.0 +   4.2.4. Aggregating query similarity and suggesting the minimum support range. Let Qa, Qb be the user defined query and the queries in the user preference ontolog respectively. Suppose the tG, tM and wc of Qa and Qb are as follows:  Qa = <tG: Ga, tM : Ma , wc: Wa> Qb = <tG: Gb, tM : Mb , wc: Wb>  The overall query similarity between Qa, Qb is defined as follows:  QSimilarity(Qa, Qb) = matchG(Ga, Gb) ? matchM(Ma, Mb) ? matchW(Wa, Wb)  Through the similarity comparison of these queries, the top N similar queries from the user preference ontology are obtained. The final range of minimum support to be offered to the user is computed by the following steps:  1. Sort supports of the top N queries; 2. Average the smaller half of the N queries as the  lower bound; 3. Average the bigger half of the N queries as the  upper bound; 4. Validate the lower bound with the smallest possible  value which is 1/n, where n is the count of the transactions after grouping. If the lower bound is beyond the smallest possible value, the smallest possible value becomes the lower bound;  5. Validate the upper bound with the largest possible value which is the maximum frequency among all the one-itemsets. If the upper bound is beyond the maximum possible support, the maximum possible support becomes the upper bound.

The result will be the favorable range of minimum support that is closer to the user?s mining intention.

The system provides the information to the user interactively while he or she is formulating a query.

This helps the user adjust the support threshold toward    obtaining better mining results. The support threshold setting is not all subjective since it also refers to the knowledge of assorted users mining experiences in the user preference ontology. The efficiency of try-and- error process can be improved while the user is formulating a mining query. The mining results are more effective and easier to get closer to the user?s need.

4. Related work   Many studies have been devoted to association rule mining [4] since it was first introduced by Agrawal et al. [1]. In their proposal, the user-specified minimum support was required to recognize the patterns as interesting. Many other researches on the interestingness measure are conducted. The major purpose is to provide the users with a better measurement for obtaining really useful knowledge. In [7] and [9], varieties of measures have been provided and discussed. Lenca et al. [7] collected many measures with their properties and using a multi- criteria aid to suggest good measures that are suitable to the user specified requirements. On providing the users with a better measurement, Zhang et al. [10] provided a polynomial strategy to map the user- specified fuzzy support threshold to an actual minimum support. Liu et al. [8] proposed a fuzzy matching technique incorporated with a set of user- specified patterns (user feedback) to help the user identify those interesting ones. Our approach for providing a user with a favorable support threshold is through extra knowledge reside in the user preference ontology, which collects the information from previous user?s mining experience.

5. Conclusions   To provide the user with a robotic support threshold setting for the Apriori algorithm used in multidimensional association mining, we propose in this paper an intelligent minimum support suggesting system framework that integrated with the user preference ontology. We describe the construction and utilization of the user preference ontology which maintains the frequently used queries in the mining log.

The methodology for query similarity comparison is presented in details. By using this methodology, the system finds the most similar queries in the user preference ontology to the user-specified query, aggregates them and obtains the favorable support range for the user to refer. With our proposed method, the setting of support threshold for Apriori algorithm is not all subjective but also includes extra knowledge  from other users? experiences. This improves the efficiency of user?s query formulation process and the result rules or the mining tend to be closer to user?s requirement.
