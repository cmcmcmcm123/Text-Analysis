Research on Web Association Rules Mining Structure with Genetic Algorithm  Ya-ling Tang and Feng Qin School of Computer,  AnHui University of Technology , Maanshan 243002, Anhui Province, China  E-mail:tangyl@ahut.edu.cn  Abstract- Association rules are import basis of describing Web users? behavior characteristic. Traditional algorithms of Web association rules mining , based on statistics, usually pays attention to the analysis on existing data ,they can?t offer effective predictive means and optimizing measure and can not find out the latent and possible rules. This paper presents a kind of system of the Web association rules mining based on genetic algorithm, which proves by experiment that it can mend the traditional Web association mining method of lack of foreseeing in latency. And it puts forward a new ideal of Web association rules mining.

Index Terms- Data Mining, Web Association Rules, Genetic Algorithm, Increment Mining, Machine Learning  ?.INTRODUCTION  Through analyzing the visiting behavior of lots of Web users, We can get the users class attributes and Web association rules(WAR) which describe their individuality. Its? form is just like production of the First-order logic, and is the important foundation for analyzing accessing and describing Web user?s behavior characters. We can use traditional association mining algorithm based on statistics to dig out the rules correctly, but it can not do something on users learning procedure and personality growing. Genetic algorithm(GA) is a kind of searching and optimizing algorithm with advantage of intelligence and self-learning which simulates biology evolution procedure[1,2].And it will improve flexibility of association mining algorithm with combining GA and statistic mining algorithm and makes up the insufficiency of mining result which is based on users of specified class, and can capture the procedure of users? psychology by machine learning.

?. GENETIC ASSOCIATION MINING SYSTEM  Web users? accessing manner is related to a certain period of the accessing behavior. The users? behavior will keep steady via a period of accessing and their interest will change with   long time passed, such as a month or so long.

Such procedure shows self-learning and growth on the Web site, and usually Web users will go through . If we can capture the changing procedure of Web users, with association rules mined through machine learning, the results of mining will take on  the excellence of foreseeing, veracity and intelligence.

It is the import basement of genetic association mining that we use increment mode to mine. Increment mining contains the changing of user behavior character, procedure of  maturing, which is mainly basis of studying for GA.

Processing log data in the Web server for a long period will cost huge time, and low efficiency, while large Web site?s log data size can be the level of Gigabyte(GB). And if we do not consider time persistence in the Web log , it will result in incorrectness or inaccurateness. Frequent items mining will partly lose or wrongly calculate out, if we don?t use increment mining algorithm. So it is necessary that we carry out increment mining, while it is also basis and direction of GA evolution .

Fig.1 shows genetic association mining structure considering  increment  mining.

Fig.1 Genetic association mining structure From Fig.1,We use Genetic association mining to get  association rules on total original transaction with increment mining algorithm .And then coding the association rules into chromosomes, which we can apply GA to mine under direction of rule guiding from the increment t mining result.

The results of researching of increment mining show that it is available to design increment mining algorithm on traditional statistic algorithm, such as SFUP  (Super Fast Update Algorithm)increment algorithm base on Apriori,  originally affair warehouse  Increment affair warehouse  Base on statistic    Increment mining  Association mining  association rule pattern warehouse  Rules distill  Chromosome coding  Genetic mining       DHP[1,3,5] . There are two cases in increment data mining, one is keeping the support and confidence threshold stable, mining the association rules on appending the increment transaction database into original database, and the other is keeping transaction database stable, mining rules considering the change of support and confidence.

Doctor Cheng has put forward the FUP(Fast Update Algorithm) that has solved the problem of case one, but in case two, the calculation procedure is more complex, IUA(Incremental Updating Algorithm) can solve it which is described in the fourth paper in detail [4].

?. DESIGNING AND REALIZATION OF GENETIC MINING FOR ASSOCIATION RULES  Association rules are hotspot  of Knowledge Discovery in Database(KDD).And in  KDD , association rules as a kind of knowledge form are usually  defined:  X=>Y        (1) X and Y are  aggregate of items, which represent  foreside and backside of the rule. It is basic form of association rules in data mining . In the Web association mining with GA, chromosome coding, genetic operator designing and constringency condition is core of GA applying[2]. In the Web association mining structure, the purpose is to mine association   rules base on cluster of users which fits the their behaviour characters. And in Web mining, association rules form can be defined: <url1,url2,?urlm>=><urlm+k,urlm+k+1,?,urlm+m> support=? ,confidence=?   (2)  On analyzing topology of Web sites,  its? equal form is: <urlcode1,urlcode2,?urlcodem>=><urlcodem+k,urlcode m+k+1,?,urlcodem+m>  (3)  Here, urlcodei represents code value of the url in layeres scheme coding ,which mainly consideres the Web topology[7].

A. Chromosome Coding.

This paper introduces a kind of mutative length characters coding scheme, while Web association rules? property determines that its? length may not be equal in our experiment system .

Eg.  a association rule is list below(URL codes formula, the number represents corresponding in Web site.) ? [282574488338432, 281474976710656] => [282583078273024]  That corresponding chromosome code is defined: 2:1#282574488338432281474976710656282583078273024  2:1 is chromosome data of structure which stands for that the foreside of chromosome is composed of two coding URL, and the rearward is one, # is character for dividing.

In the actual GA mining, binary coding is also adopted , the chromosome showed  above can be also coded as: 10:1#100000001000000000000000000000000000000000000 B. Designing Function of Fitness  Genetic association rules mining is a kind of foreseeing mining to find out probably excellent rules ,which is a kind of special heuristic searching based on exist rules. It may causes the problem that rules mined with GA are not valid or can not easily to determine its? accurate confidence and support value.

Therefore, defining fitness function of new chromosome from genetic mining should differ from statistic mining chromosome.

For increment mining indicates learning procedure of Web users, we can define new chromosome?s fitness value in increment mining as similarity degree that relates to the most like chromosome from genetic mining. And chromosome from statistic mining fitness value is mainly composed of its support and confidence.

Defines:Fit(chromosome)=  sup* ( )) * ( )(1)  _ ( , _ ( )(2) cfK C F chrom osom e K SU P chrom osom e  F Like chromosome F N ear chrom osom e  +? ? ?    case (1):represents chromosome mined from statistic algorithm.

case(2):represents chromosome mined from genetic algorithm.

Kcf represents coefficient of confidence, Ksup represents coefficient of support.

F_like is function for that chromosome have the most similarity, F_near is function for calculating out the chromosome which is the nearest to the independent variable of chromosome. They both foundation is built on distance which can be calculated in layer-coding scheme for URL [6,7].

1). Define: F_near(chromosome0) If  exist, chromosome0,chromosome1,chromosome2,?chromomosome N swarm, and the nearest distance between any two chromosome is chromosome0 and chromosome1.

Supposed? chromosome0=2:1#A1B1C1 ? chromosome1=2:1#P1Q1N1 ? chromosome2=2:1#X1Y1Z1 dis1=distance(chromosome,chromosome1)=[(A1-P1)2+(B1- Q1)2+(C1-N1)2]1/2 dis2=distance(chromosome,chromosome2)=[(A1-X1)2+(B1- Y1)2+(C1-Z1)2]1/2 If dis1<dis2 then F_near(chromosome)?chromosome1 2).F_like(chromesome, chromosome1) Define? F_like(chromesome,chromosome1)=(1-dis1/|chromosome|)* [Kcf*CF(chromosome)+Ksup*SUP(chromosome)] C. Define Genetic Operator and Convergence Condition 1). Selector Operator  Selector operator?s function is to select father chromosomes into mating pool according to fitness value, and its? scheme is betting with excellence reservation. It is same to the selector in genetic cluster, here the selector probability is set to 0.8 by experiment testing ( The detail is shown in conference 7).

2). Crossover Operator       Theory of selecting Crossover operator is based on knowledge tree of GA, which colony searching strategy and exchanging between individuals is the mainly based on their characters. It is kernel idea that we use GA to try, to search and make the knowledge trees evolve. And for survival of fittest, it will reserve the more high fitness value trees, while the evolvement results may not be the best. On the other hand, GA adopts genes adjustment and combination that will make more high individuals and new knowledge trees. Finally we will get better new rules in the higher fitness trees.

There are three cases in knowledge trees for crossover operator: Case 1:exchanging subtrees in the same knowledge tree Case 2:exchanging subtrees between knowledge tree Case 3:using child node(include leaf node) to replace ancestor node(include indirect ancestor ).

The three cases  are showed in the Fig.2   (a)     (b)     (c)   Fig.2 Crossover in knowledge   The probability of crossover operator is usually set to  over 0.9 in order to guaranteeing evolving speed. When it carrys out genetic mining crossover operator, first should make the allele on the same location, then exchanges them on each  position.  Furthermore, designing of crossover operator should pay attention to chromosomes structure of gene and the operator?s enthusiasm and scope for gene?s  exchanging in Web association mining. Fig.3 shows the flow chart of crossover operator.

Gene activity of exchanging? Conservative: That each exchanging gene belongs to same subtree and same layer.

Active: That each exchanging gene belongs to same layer but not same subtree.

Scope of exchanging: Case 1:.Only exchanges allele subtree of rules rear.

Case 2:.Only exchanges allele subtree of rules head Case 2:.Exchanges the allele of whole rules.

3).Mutation Operator  The purpose of using mutation operator is mainly for importing new genes and not exist individuals in parents swarm. During carrying out in Web association rules mining, considering mutation individuals may not actual exist ,that gene codes is according to real URL codes, we usually set mutation probability quite small , as below 0.01 ,and will validate the new genes generated by mutation.

4).Constringency Condition  Usually, there two states should be regarded, and one is that algorithm has found the best results or steady swarms appear, the other is that program of algorithm have run over specified generations . We usually set priority later higher than the front.

5).Rules Decoding  Decoding is not too complex, that is reversion procedure of coding. Its process is to translate chromosomes to association rules, and validate rules in Web sites from genetic mining.

D. The Whole Procedure of Association Rules Mining with GA  In the mining system, all jobs can be divided into several parts. The first step is to draw the rules from  the knowledge warehouse which has been built by statistics mining algorithm.

Then puts these rules into mating pool which have been coded into chromosomes form, and these rules are regard as father chromosomes. The second step of procession is to makes these father chromosomes to be matched into groups every two , and makes  alleles of father chromosomes on the same location,  parent chromosome mates in evolution pool  Analyzing parents chromosomes, searching the best matching alleles  selecting cross mode, exchanging the alleles  calculate chromosomes fitness value  Fig.3 Crossover operator flow chart       then swaps the allele directed by crossover operator. The third step is to makes chromosomes?s genes mutate using mutation operator, validates availability of these chromosomes.

After these three steps , the last job is to calculate the fitness of these chromosomes, and judge the constringency condition.

And if meets the constringency condition of GA, then do the rule decoding work, else go to the first step for next cycle. In the end of the processing  that has satisfied the constringency condition of GA, does the work of decoding of chromosomes.

Table 1 shows the results to decode rules into URL forms with a few part of data.

TABLE 1 rules decoding    ? EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  In our experiment system, the whole mining procedure is composed of several steps. The beginning is preparing data for mining ,which includes job of  extracting data from  Web site?s log and analyzing structure of Web sites topology.  Then clusteres the web users into several swarms  for characters analyzing ,and the last is mining association rules with genetic algorithm .

Here,  the emphases is to find out the specialty of  mining rules with genetic algorithm . So we test validity and efficiency of association rules which had been mined from several algorithm as comparison from Table 2, it  shows  that algorithm with GA has excellence of foreseeing, that more association rules can be mined out in time without sufficient log data supporting. Using GA with Aprori or FP-Tree to mine association rules can find out more than that only with Apriori or FP-Tree and it can raise the adaptability for intelligence and personality of analyzing users characteristic behavior. So applying the rules from GA, we can guide and forecast Web  users behavior on Web site, which does work for searching personality of Web intelligent service system.

In our experiment system, GA do thoroughly calculation for data mining ,so that we can find out the expected and latent association rules in our transaction database by genetic learning mode. Our system is the data analyzing part of intelligence service of Web, and test data includes Web log and site topology drawn out from Suzhou University Web site built by the  Institute of  Intelligent information Processing and Application.

Finally ,The results of analyzing show that we can realize the optimizing and forecasting for exist and latent association rules, by utilizing GA to mine the statistic mining result, and it surely can compensates halfway results that by the no sufficient visiting amount of Web users on one certain class swarm. Thus, we draw a conclusion that the genetic mining can catch up with this learning procedure of Web users well enough, and it is also a new research direction for Web using mining.
