I.  INTRODUCTION In recent years, data mining based on privacy preserving  has become a hot spot of database study. Association rules are researched popularly too. Association rule mining is to find the interesting relationship and interrelationship of item sets among the mass data. The privacy preserving of association rule is an operation done to hide the sensitive rules aimed to frustrate the data user?s attempt to mine the data from its owner before the process of association rule mining. To implement the privacy preserving of data, we need to consider the follow two points: One is how to ensure the privacy not to be revealed during data application process.

Another is how to make it better for data application. At present, the study of privacy preserving is concentrated on how to design a better algorithm while balance the two points mentioned above [2].

As for the privacy preserving of association rule, SWA [1] based on heuristic algorithm has been advanced recently.

However, SWA algorithm doesn?t take the effect of the non- sensitive rules into consideration. Document [3] advanced a new transpose privacy protection algorithm based on SWA algorithm. Through a proper shift of the sensitive set, it can hide the sensitive set while lessen the effect of non-sensitive set. However, it doesn?t take the cost of the shift of the sensitive set into consideration. Document [3] advanced a method to choose the proper sensitive sets to be deleted while lessen the supportability of other sets which are in the assemblages of sensitive sets. However, it doesn?t take the effect of the non-sensitive rules into consideration. On the    basis of the algorithms mentioned above, this paper advanced an Association rule mining algorithm based on privacy preserving (SWTA). Through the proper combination of the two algorithms, it can make the least data managements on the original data base while hide the sensitive item sets as many as possible and lessen the effect of non-sensitive sets in item sets. This method can solve the problem of association rule privacy preserving better.



II. DEFINITION OF TERMS Definition 1: sensitive rules: all the rules needed to be  hidden by the data owner are called sensitive rule.

Definition 2: affair sensitive sets: all the sets contained in  sensitive rules.

Definition 3: rule loss rate: the rate of the loss of original  association rules after hiding the sensitive rules.

Definition 4: affair refresh rate: the occupancy of the  amount of affairs needs to be changed in the whole affairs at the situation of the same supportability and confidence level.

Definition 5: transpose candidate affair: affair T is the proper subset of T1 exclusive I. If we shift I of T1 to T, we can make the supportability of Ri (assemblage of sensitive item sets) reduce 1 degree, and then T will be the transpose candidate affair of I in T1 which specifics to Ri.

Definition 6: the best transpose candidate affair: if there are several Ti which are transpose candidate affairs of Ti, the closest T1 will be the best transpose candidate affair of I in T1 which specifics to Ri.

Definition 7: Sj is the jst sensitive item set in assemblages of sensitive item sets SI, SI={S1, S2, Sj, Si} if the algorithms is processing Sj, then SI?={Sj+1,Sj+2, Si}.

Definition 8: The multiplicity of a item in Sj marked as Num (item, Sj, SI?, Tj), that is, the number of item in the item sets appeared in Tj from SI? (sensitive item sets).

Definition 9: Association rule mining: make I={i1, i2, i3, i4, im}, is the item sets of the data base of DB, T={T1, T2, T3,  Tm} is the assemblage of all the affairs in the original data base. All the items contained in Tj are the subsets of I. association rule are a kind of expression like--X  Y, with x and y is a non-intersect item sets, that is, x?y ? . The intensity of association rules can be expressed by support and confidence. Its mathematical formula is:  Support (x?y) = |x y / N Confidence (x?y) =|x y| / |x|  Volume 4  C 978-1-4244-5586-7/10/$26.00      2010 IEEE     X and y are the proper subsets of I. N is the number of affairs contained in data base of DB; |x y| is the number of the same affair in x and y. x  is the number of affairs of x contained in DB. Then, association rule mining is the rule of the threshold of minsupp and minConf whose supportability and confidence level are bigger than their preliminary definition.



III. SWTA ALGORITHM  A. Algorithm theory As is showed by the table I (the data base DB), item set  I={A, B, C, D, E, F}, if a set of one affair appeared in the affair, then its value is 1,otherwise, it is 0. As for sensitive item set assemblage SI, SI={S1, S2, Sj Si}, if we mine the data base DB with the traditional association rule mining algorithm, there will be sensitive item set Sj   to be found. It means that item sets Sj   is the sensitive item set assemblage needing to be hidden. As a result, the traditional data mining algorithm can not meet the need of privacy preserving.

According to the definition of association rule, on the premise of invariability of   N and x, if we lessen the value of y properly, then we can lessen the supportability and confidence level of rule x y until to the minimum threshold required. SWA [1] is to find the sensitive item set whose frequency is high in a sensitive item set assemblage and delete it. However, it will affect the non-sensitive item set. If T1 is a long transaction, the non-sensitive item sets whose supportability is lessening become more. Then, the result will be that sensitive item sets are lessening while the supportability of the non-sensitive item sets will be affected largely. In order to lessen the effect of non-sensitive item set, we shift the sensitive item set of sensitive rule with the method of transpose. In this way, we can make the effect to non-sensitive item sets to a minimum degree. With the method of IMBA [1], we can use transpose to lessen the effect of non-sensitive rule to a minimum degree and protect non- sensitive rule better. However, it doesn?t take the cost of the shift of the sensitive set into consideration.

The material algorithm can be described as the follows: As for the frequent item sets needed to be hidden, for example, Sj(Sj SI , Sj Ti) from Ti that contains Sj  , we can shift the proper item of Sj , with |x y|=|x y|-1,the values of N and |x| keep invariant. Keep repeating this step until Support (x  y)  |x  y| / N < minSupp or Confidence (x y)=|x y|/|x| minConf. Then, find the affair Tk(Tk ? Ti Sj ? Tk= ? ),and take the item sets needed to be shift to Tk. while the difference of the length of the affairs Ti and Tk is shortest, the supportability of sensitive item sets lessens, and the effect of the supportability of the non-sensitive is less.

B. Illustration Affair library table one, {T1: ABCD, T2: CD, T3: ABCD  EF,T4:BDF,T5:ABCD,T6:BCF,T7:ABD,T8:BCDEF}, specifies the minimum supportability as 40%, the minimum confidence level as 60%.Counting support{A B}=4/8=50%,  and confidence{ A B }=4/4=100%. With the algorithm of PPARM, we can find that a=1, b=2, k=min (a, b) =1. What we need to do is to delete one time of the sensitive affair that contains item B, and then, its confidence level will be lessened to 37.5%<40%, which meets the requirement. If we use the traditional Apriori algorithm, we can get 9 association rules. Supposing rule A B, B F, E F is sensitive rules, then the sensitive item sets assemblage is SI={{A, B}, {B, F}, {E, F}}, and the processing sensitive item sets assemblage is S1={A, B}. Then, the sensitive item sets assemblage to be proceeded is SI?={{B, F}, {E, F}}, Num (B, {A, B}, SI?, T1)=1,Num=(A, {A, B}, SI?, T1)=0.we can learn that if we shift A from T1, it will not affect the sensitive item sets of SI?, if we shift B, it will affect the sensitive sets assemblage {B, F} of SI. In order to lessen the times of modifying the data base, we will shift out the sensitive item set with a bigger Num value according to the selections of algorithm. Then, it can ensure to hide the sensitive item set while lessen the supportability of the sensitive item set assemblage to be processed. If the Num value of different subjects in Sj is the same, then we will choose to shift the item with a lower supportability. The goal of this action is to lessen the times of modifying the data base. Then we will reach the situation of shifting the data less while hiding the sensitive rule more.

TABLE I. AFFAIR DATA LIBRARY  TID A B C D E F T1 1 1 1 1 0 0 T2 0 0 1 1 0 0 T3 1 1 1 1 1 1 T4 0 1 0 1 0 1 T5 1 1 1 1 0 0 T6 0 1 1 0 0 1 T7 1 1 0 1 0 0 T8 0 1 1 1 1 1  At the same time, we need to consider that if we shift B, the supportability of AB lessens to a degree under the minimum, then, we should take all the modes affected by the shifting of B into consideration: AB, BC, BD, ABD, BCD, and ABCD. Due to the shifting of B, the supportability of the three non-sensitive sets (BC, BD, and BCD) lessens 1 degree.

As a result, although we hide sensitive AB, we affect the supportability of non-sensitive rule.  If we shift B of T1 to T2, the supportability reduced to a degree under the minimum, and while the supportability of the one contains AB reduces 1 degree, it doesn?t affect the supportability of other non- sensitive item sets. Then, T2 is the best transpose candidate affair of T1.Through this, it can make the least data managements on the original data base while hide the sensitive item sets as many as possible and lessen the effect of non-sensitive sets in item sets.

IV. ANALYTICAL PROOF OF THE ALGORITHM ? a=mod D ? (Supp (x y)- minSupp)) +1 ? Proof: supposing that after we delete y from several  a (the number of the affair containing x and y together), we can make the supportability of the rule meet the requirement to hide this association rule.

That is, ||x y|-a|/|D|< minSupp, after minkowski: |x y|-|D|?minSupp<a,So, min a = mod ( D ? (Supp(x y)-minSupp))+1.

? b=mod ( D ? (Supp (x y)-minConf?Supp (x))) +1.

? Proof: supposing that after we delete y from several b (the number of the affair containing x and y together), we can make the confidence level of the rule meet the requirement to hide this association rule. That is, ||x y|-b|/|x|<minConf,after minkowski:  |x y|-|x|?minConf <b.So,min b =mod ( D ? (Supp(x  y)-minConf ?Supp(x))) +1.



V. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS All the data we have used in this experiment is from  affair assemblage D produced from IBM Almaden Research Center, and the parameter is T10, I4, D10k, and N100. That is, each affair has 10 sets on average, the average length of frequent item sets assemblage is 4, the total number of affairs is 100 00, the total item sets is 100. In order to test the effect of algorithm, the paper builds 3 evaluating indicators: the first one is rule loss rate; the second one is affair refresh rate; the last one is the hide performance ratio (specific to sensitive rule). This experiment used MATLAB emulation program. The result can be shown in the chart below:  We can learn from the chart that: Compared with PPARM, this method solved the problem of affecting the non-sensitive rules and the rule loss rate became lower obviously. Compared with IMBA, this method solved the problem of selecting ways to deal with the sensitive sets of sensitive rule and made the refresh time of affairs much lower. The refresh rate became lower obviously under the situation of the same hide performance.



VI. CONCLUSION On the basis of PPARM and IMBA algorithm, this paper  advanced a new algorithm to take the advantages of them and combine them together, it can make the least data managements on the original data base while hide the sensitive item sets as many as possible and lessen the effect of non-sensitive sets in item sets. And its validity was proved  %   %   (%)  %  IMBA  SWTA  PPARM  SWTA  Volume 4     by experiment. This algorithm makes a high protection of the privacy.
