Scalable and Trustworthy Cross-Enterprise WfMSs by Cloud Collaboration

Abstract?Establishing scalable and cross-enterprise workflow management systems (WfMSs) in the cloud requires the adaptation and extension of existing concepts for process management. This paper proposes a scalable and cross- enterprise WfMS with a multitenancy architecture. Especially, it can activate enactment of workflow processes by cloud collaboration. We do not employ the traditional engine-based WfMSs. The key idea is to have the workflow process instance to be self-protected and does not need a workflow engine to secure the data therein. Thus, the process instance discovery and activity execution can be fully independently and distributed. As a result, we can employ the data storage system, BigTable, to store the process instances, which may form a big data. The applying of element-wise encryption and chained digital signature makes it satisfy major security requirements of authentication, confidentiality, data integrity, and nonrepudiation.

I. INTRODUCTION  Workflow management systems (WfMSs) are software systems that support coordination and cooperation among members of an organization whilst they perform complex business tasks [1], [2], [3]. Business tasks are modeled as workflow processes that are automated by the WfMS. The workflow model (also referred to as the workflow process definition) is the computerized representation of the business process that defines the starting and stopping conditions of the process, the activities in the process, and control and data flows among these activities. An activity is a logic step within a workflow. The activities in a process are usually organized into a directed graph that defines the order of their execution, where nodes and edges in the graph represent activities and control flow, respectively. A workflow process instance represents a state of execution of a workflow process definition by the WfMS, and is usually controlled by the workflow engine.

A popular way to construct WfMSs in the cloud is to deploy workflow engines in the cloud computing infrastructure; examples of this approach include RunMyProcess [4], Visual Workflow [5], Aneka [6], Azure Services Platform [7], and Google App Engine [8].

Centralized WfMSs focus on executing workflow processes within a single organization at one location in a single   ?

A workflow process is executed by a single workflow engine that communicates with all of the participants in the activity.

To fit with the rapidly changing business environment and with the highly varying load of e-business applications, WfMSs should be scalable and should provide the required flexibility to cope with peaks in the system load and distributed environment. Consider the working model of the engine-based distributed WfMS shown in Figure 1B [9], [10], [11], [12]. The workflow process has six activities (numbered A1?A6) that are designed to be executed in three workflow engines deployed at three locations. Establishing multiple workflow engines provides the abilities to (1) balance the load among the workflow engines as the number of users increases [13] and (2) reduce the communication time between the participants in the activity and the workflow engines since the latter are close to the user (in terms of the network transmission).

Working models of the centralized WfMS and the ordinary engine-based distributed WfMS.

The engine-based distributed WfMS can be used to build up the cross-enterprise WfMS that controls the execution of cross-enterprise workflow processes. The participants of activities in a cross-enterprise workflow process belong to different companies or organizations. These participants usually connect to the workflow engines in their own companies or organizations due to authentication requirements. The engine-based distributed WfMS suffers  2013 IEEE International Congress on Big Data  DOI 10.1109/BigData.Congress.2013.19     from serious security problems because the workflow process instances might be transmitted on a public network such as the Internet. Therefore, the execution results of activities might be eavesdropped or malicious users might intercept the process instances and then alter their contents before passing them on to the next workflow engine.

Although the above two problems can easily be solved by applying common methods used to secure electronic transactions with secure sockets, such as the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol [14], such methods still cannot guarantee the nonrepudiation requirement. That is, it is difficult for the system to prevent a participant from being able to deny what he/she had done in an activity.

One of the features of the engine-based WfMSs (either centralized or distributed) is that the workflow engines must be managed by administrators in this model, since the workflow process instances are usually stored in them or database servers close to them [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. The user communicates with the administrated workflow engines to participate in the execution of the WfMS via the network.

The security of a process instance is assured by the server rather than by the process instance itself. The workflow engines in cross-enterprise WfMSs may be administrated by different companies or organizations in a distributed network environment, and the overall security is insufficient if the security mechanism is broken in any one of the servers that may access or store the process instance. The question then arises about how to design a trust model for workflow engines in cross-enterprise (or cross-organization) WfMSs.

Multitenancy refers to a principle in software architecture where a single instance of the software runs on a server, serving multiple client organizations (tenants) [15]. The shared infrastructure changes the underlying economics of enterprise applications, letting the vendor maintain a single application instance for thousands of customers. In a multitenancy cloud environment, multiple vendors, using the same infrastructure, can access and share the same resource.

The multitenancy enables economic pay-as-you-go services in nature [16]. There are a number of different methods for achieving multitenancy including virtualization or database sharing. Virtualization is simply another technology for achieving multitenancy, especially for infrastructure as a service (IaaS): multiple virtual machines in a single physical machine for serving multiple tenancies can be treated as the simplest applying of multitenancy. Some cloud systems can support more advanced multitenancy architectures such as sharing of a database or even sharing of tables in a database [17], [18]. With a multitenant architecture, a software application is designed to virtually partition its data and configuration, and each client organization works with a customized virtual application instance. One of the major reasons to adopt a multitenancy architecture for cloud applications is to achieve high cost efficiencies and can deliver low costs. True cloud services all use some mode of multitenancy which supports the ability for multiple client organizations to share the same applications, data, and/or compute resources. The multitenancy architecture fits the data sharing requirement for cross-enterprise WfMSs in which a single process instance may be accessed by different  organizations. However, developing a multitenancy WfMS is not only for deliver low costs but also for the cross-enterprise requirement. Since people from different organizations may need to communicate or exchange data to participant in a single workflow process in a cross-enterprise WfMS, a cross-enterprise WfMS requires more than just multitenancy.

Cloud collaboration for documents is a newly emerging way of sharing and co-authoring documents through the use of cloud computing, whereby documents or objects are uploaded to a central cloud, where they can then be accessed by others, e.g. Google document and Google Calendar  [19], [20]. In addition to the characteristics of multitenancy, a participant can execute its own task without the interference by other participant and can also share data with other participant when needs. The execution of a cross-enterprise workflow process requires participants from different organization to work together and share data according to the workflow definition. It motivates us to study how to design a cross-enterprise WfMS which can provide workflow enactment service by cloud collaboration.

Applying the engine-based WfMS in a multitenancy cloud computing environment increases the security problems because the workflow engines are usually installed on servers that are not administrated by the company or organization that uses them. The issues of trusted execution in untrusted cloud infrastructure received much attention when cloud computing provided concrete use cases [21]. For instance, there are a lot of solutions for untrusted server in the cloud storage including replication [22], [23], [24], [25], detection of violation [26], [27], and auditing [28], [29]. For constructing WfMSs in untrusted cloud infrastructure, in addition to the nonrepudiation requirement, the client organization may need the system to support secured process instance migration and replication in which it can control the migration and replication of process instances on its own. In this situation, the process instance cannot be bound to a specific workflow engine. The security requirements of authentication, confidentiality, data integrity, and nonrepudiation should still be maintained after process instance migration and replication.

In this paper we propose a secured, scalable, and multitenancy WfMS in which it supports workflow enactment by cloud collaboration. First, we have to solve these security problems in engine-based WfMSs for supporting cross-enterprise WfMSs. Second, we assume that it is possible that participants of a single workflow process come from any organizations and these participants are decided dynamically during the life time of the workflow process. Therefore, we have to house multiple tenants in the same database. The execution of a workflow process is actually a kind of cloud collaboration. Third, the large number of process instances stored in the system could form a big data1 as the system should serve a huge number of client organizations.

We invented an architecture that we have called the Document Routing Architecture for WfMS (DRA4WfMS  1 Big data is a collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools [30].

[31]). The DRA4WfMS is called a document-routine system because the execution of a workflow process can be fulfilled by routing secured process instances among activities participants. It is not only a distributed WfMS but also a totally engine-less WfMS ? the activity execution is not controlled by any workflow engine, instead being carried out by a software agent in the local computer of the participant.

The software agent can be located anywhere or be any type of computer device. We employ the element-wise encryption that is commonly used in XML security [32], [33] and propose a way to chain embedded digital signatures for the routed documents. This method enables a DRA4WfMS document to be secured without requiring an access-control server.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II we present the basic and advanced operational model of the DRA4WfMS. The way to apply the DRA4WfMS in the cloud computing environment is presented in Section III.

The way which we apply the big table in DRA4WfMS is presented in Section IV. Section V discusses how to construct trustworthy DRA4WfMS in untrusted cloud infrastructures. Experimental results are given in Section VI.

Related work and conclusions are drawn in Sections VII and VIII, respectively.



II. OPERATIONAL MODEL OF DRA4WFMS The DRA4WfMS is a document-routing-based and an  engine-less WfMS. Before we explain how the DRA4WfMS can be constructed by applying the big table, we first introduce why the execution of a workflow process can be fulfilled by routing secured process instances among activities participants. The DRA4WfMS documents will be routed to participants of activities in different locations.

During the routing, the execution result of each activity will be appended to it. Thus, a DRA4WfMS document contains static and dynamic information within it.

Digital signature embedded by a workflow participant  X?A2  X?A0  X?A3  The secured initial document  X?A1  Figure 2. The basic operational model of DRA4WfMS.

The static information is actually the initial document. It contains the workflow definition as well as a digital signature embedded by the workflow designer. This digital signature signs the workflow definition in the initial document, which is necessary for the participants of the activities to verify whether it is a legal workflow process.

Actually, different portions in the workflow process instance may need to be encrypted using different keys since each activity may be executed by different participants. It requires so-called element-wise encryption [32] ,[33]. An obvious way to encrypt an XML document is to employ existing  cryptography to encrypt an XML document as a whole. The receiver of an encrypted XML document then decrypts it with the appropriate key and algorithm. However, some researchers considered encrypting a whole XML document without dividing it up as cumbersome, and consequently proposed element-wise encryption that the encryption is held at the element level.

The execution result of each activity is part of the dynamic information in a DRA4WfMS document. To fulfill security requirements of authentication, confidentiality, data integrity, and nonrepudiation, execution results should be element-wisely encrypted and digital signatures which sign these execution results are embedded.  When the monitoring of workflow processes is necessary, some timestamps should also be embedded in the DRA4WfMS document. All the data items which are appended or embedded into the DRA4WfMS document during the execution of the workflow process are considered as dynamic information. In the follows, we first present the basic operation model and then the advanced operational model of DRA4WfMS.

We show the basic operational model of DRA4WfMS as shown in Figure 2. Before the execution of an activity A?, DRA4WfMS document X?? is sent to the participant of the activity A? who employs a software tool called the activity execution agent (AEA) to activate the execution of activities.

First, the AEA parses X??  and verifies all the embedded digital signatures therein so as to ensure that the workflow definition in X?? is legal and all the stored execution results of previously executed activities are valid. Second, the AEA checks if the participant is the correct executor of this activity. Third, the AEA looks at the requests and responses of this activity and shows them to the participant in a graphical user interface in which the participant can perform the execution of this activity. Fourth, the AEA appends the execution result (i.e., response) of the participant to X?? (the resulting document is X??  ? ). Fifth, the AEA embeds a digital signature that signs the execution result of the participant and some of the digital signatures embedded in previous activities (the resulting document is X??  ?? ). The encrypted execution result and the digital signature consists of the characteristic execution result (CER) of activity A?. Finally, the AEA checks the control flow information defined in the workflow definition and forwards X??  ??   to the participant (or AEA) of the next activity (or activities).

AEA  Start  A1 ?  AEA TFC Server  A2  Time stamp embedded by the timestamp server  TFC Server  XitA1 X?A1 XitA2  Figure 3. The advanced operational model of DRA4WfMS.

The advanced operational model shown in Figure 3 is actually an improvement of that in Figure 2. The DRA4WfMS document processed by an AEA, X??  ?? , which contains a CER embedded by AEA, is first sent to a     timestamp and flow control server (TFC server), which is analogous to a notary public and has legal authority to witness the finish time of the activity. Note that a TFC server is not a workflow engine as it only embeds timestamps to DRA4WfMS documents and helps with their forwarding.

When the TFC server receives X??  ?? , it first checks the digital signatures, embeds a timestamp of the time when the TFC server processed this document, and embeds a digital signature which chains the timestamp to X??  ?? .

In DRA4WfMS, the confidentiality is maintained by the  element-wise encryption which is specified in the secured initial document X??  ?? . The execution result embedded in a CER must be signed. Illegal alteration of elements in a DRA4WfMS document will cause errors when we verify digital signatures which sign them. Thus, we can achieve the requirement of integrity. A DRA4WfMS document contains a lot of CERs. Each CER ? has its own nonreputiation scope.

A nonreputiation scope of ? is consisted of a set of CERs which are CERs chained by the digital signature within ?. If a CER ? is with a nonreputiation scope ?, then the participant which generated the CER ? cannot deny having received a DRA4WfMS document containing CERs in ? and accordingly generates ?.

III. APPLYING THE DRA4WFMS IN THE CLOUD COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT  Figure 4 shows how to apply the DRA4WfMS in the cloud computing environment using the advanced operational model presented in Section II. A user connects to one of the portal servers to access the DRA4WfMS cloud system, and that server checks what activities are going to be executed by the user. Since the workflow process instances are stored as DRA4WfMS documents, the portal server just simply sends a copy of the DRA4WfMS document, X??  ?? , to  the participant. The participant employs an AEA to execute the activity and generate a DRA4WfMS document, X??   ?? , by embedding a CER, and then sends it back to the portal server.

When an AEA sends the resulting document (X??   ?? ) to the portal server, the portal server verifies it and embeds a timestamp into the resulting document and stores X??   ??  in the DRA4WfMS documents pool. By checking this document, the DRA4WfMS cloud system can inform the subsequent participant(s) that s/he(they) is(are) the participant(s) of the next activity.

To start a workflow process, the participant has to download a secured initial DRA4WfMS document from the DRA4WfMS cloud system. The secured initial DRA4WfMS documents can be prepared by the system or uploaded to the system by the user. The DRA4WfMS cloud system should provide interfaces for users to search and manage DRA4WfMS documents.

An AEA connects to one of the portal servers in the DRA4WfMS cloud system. The portal server authenticates the ID of the user and then performs the following operations:  ? Search DRA4WfMS documents: The user can obtain a list of links of DRA4WfMS documents where s/he is one of the participants of the subsequent activities. A very similar procedure is used to obtain the TO-DO list in a WfMS.

? Retrieve a DRA4WfMS document: According to the search result, the user can retrieve a DRA4WfMS document and then execute the activity in an AEA.

? Store a DRA4WfMS document: The resulting DRA4WfMS document produced by an AEA should be stored in the pool of DRA4WfMS documents.

? Notify the subsequent participants: After a resulting DRA4WfMS document is stored, the portal server should inform the participants of the next activities.

? Perform workflow monitoring or statistical analyses: The user can display information about the activity status of a workflow process.



IV. APPLYING BIGTABLE TO CONSTRUCT DRA4WFMS DOCUMENTS POOL  Bigtable is a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size: petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers [34]. It is one of the solutions to store structured big data in a table-like architecture. We can activate MapReduce computation for efficient searching in it. The scalability nature of it makes it suitable for multitenancy systems. We employed the Apache Hadoop [35] to implement the pool of DRA4WfMS documents, which was constructed by the HBase database. HBase is an open-source implementation of the BigTable architecture and a distributed column-oriented database built on top of HDFS (the distributed file system of Hadoop). It is the optimal Hadoop application to use when real-time read/write random accesses to very large datasets are required. A DRA4WfMS document is stored as a cell in a row of an HBase table.



IV.1 TABLE SCHEMA A Bigtable is a sparse, distributed, persistent  multidimensional sorted map. The map is indexed by a row key, column key, and a timestamp; each value in the map is an uninterpreted array of bytes. A column key is named using the following syntax: ?column family?: ?qualifier?.

Figure 5 shows the table schema for a DRA4WfMS document pool.

And- split  And- join  Initial document  Figure 6. A workflow process  When a participant finishes the execution of an activity A? , s/he sends a DRA4WfMS X??  ??  to a portal server. The portal server creates a new row to store X??  ??  which is stored in ?DraDoc:XML?. The ?Row? is the row key which is consisted of ?Company name?, ?Workflow ID?, ?Process ID?, ?Activity ID?, and ?Index 2 ?, e.g., ?tw.edu.ntnu_ WF3456_P1029890_A1_0001?. ?Activity: UpdateTime? stores the timestamp which shows when the upload is completed. Although this timestamp is also embedded in the DRA4WfMS document stored in ?DraDoc:XML?, we store it in a separate cell for efficient lookup. The portal server should derive the subsequent activity/activities and the corresponding participants and store it in ?Activity:NextActivities?. Figure 7 shows the rows which were created when the workflow process shown in Figure 6 was executed. ?A_0 (A_Agency)? in the first row means that the subsequent activity and its participant is ?A_0? and ?A_Agency?, respectively. Note that ?A? is the ID of an activity and ?0? is the index of it; ?A_Agency? could be an ID of a participant or a role. It is obvious that the form allows multiple participants for a single activity, e.g. ?A_0 (John, Mary, TA_Agency)?.

Some rows in a DRA4WfMS document pool table.

It is very common for a WfMS to support the notification function in which a participant is informed immediately when an activity is ready to be executed by him/her.

However, the information contained in this table is insufficient for the portal server to decide if it should notify the participant of the subsequent activities. For example, referring to Figure 8. The execution of two activities ?A_0? and ?B1_0? are completed for the workflow process shown in Figure 6. When activity ?B1? is finished, it creates the third row and derives the subsequent activity and its participant is ?C_0? and ?C_Agency?, respectively.

However, ?C_Agency? should not be informed to execute ?C_0? because there is an ?and-join? of activities ?B_1? and ?B_2? before ?C_0?. It means that activity ?C_0? can be activated only if both activities ?B_1? and ?B_2? are finished. We suggest to construct a notification table for each workflow as shown in Figure 9 which is based on the workflow definition shown in Figure 6. Referring to the fourth row in this table. According to workflow definition with ID WF3456, activity ?C_i? can be activated when ?B1_i? and ?B2_i? are finished, where ?i? is the index of the activity. The first row means that ?A_0? should be activated when workflow process starts and ?A_i? can be activated when ?D_i-1? is finished.

Row Activity:Notification  tw.edu.ntnu_WF3456_A_i START (i=0) | Finished[D_(i-1)] tw.edu.ntnu_WF3456_B1_i Finished[A_(i)] tw.edu.ntnu_WF3456_B2_i Finished[A_(i)] tw.edu.ntnu_WF3456_C_i Finished[B1_(i)] & Finished[B2_(i)] tw.edu.ntnu_WF3456_D_i Finished[C_(i)]  Figure 9. Some rows in a DRA4WfMS notification table.

Generally speaking, it is no need to use the MapReduce computation when we need to retrieve and store a DRA4WfMS document. When a participant receives a notification, which contains the workflow definition ID, workflow process ID, activity ID and index, to ask him/her to execute an activity, it uses these information to request a retrieval for the necessary DRA4WfMS documents. After the execution is finished, he/she can upload a DRA4WfMS document according to the notification information.

The notification information can be sent to the participant via E-mail or any other kind of communication system.

When a participant receives the notification information, it usually stores it and then processing the execution of activity accordingly. However, the notification information may get lost. Intuitively, one of the solutions is that the system maintains a TO-DO list for all the participants. However, the TO-DO list of a participant may change dynamically as the role of a participant may change. When the notification information of a participant is lost or we change the role of a participant, we have to search the DRA4WfMS document pool table to derive the TO-DO list for that participant.

Because we support multitenancy architecture, we must offer an efficient way to search the table. Fortunately, Hadoop supports MapReduce computation for parallel processing of rows in HBase table. To derive the TO-DO list for a participant, we activate the MapReduce computation in DRA4WfMS document pool table. Each row is processed in parallel. The cell ?Activity:NextActivities? is checked to find if it contains the ID of the participant. Then, we employ the DRA4WfMS notification table to decide if the activity is ready to start.



V. CONSTRUCTING DRA4WFMS IN UNTRUSTED CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE  The DRA4WfMS documents stored in a DRA4WfMS cloud system usually contain important data. Storing important data in cloud storage is associated with serious security risks. The service provider can leak confidential data, modify the data, or return inconsistent data to users. Any of these problems may occur due to bugs, crashes, operator errors, or misconfigurations. Furthermore, malicious security attacks can be much harder to defend against and also be more damaging than accidental ones: external adversaries may illegally access the servers operated by the cloud storage provider, or employees of the service provider may commit insider attacks. Such security breaches are possible even if a cloud storage provider implements strong security practices.

None of today?s cloud storage services provide security guarantees in their service-level agreements (SLAs). For example, the SLAs of S3 [36] and Azure [37] only guarantee availability: if availability falls below 99.9%, clients are reimbursed a contractual sum of money. The applying element-wise encryption and chaining characteristic execution results make DRA4WfMS fulfill the security features of authentication, confidentiality, data integrity, and nonrepudiation. Even though the servers which store the process instances are not controlled by a company, this company does not have to worry about the security problems for workflow processes. However, the client still cannot ensure that his/her data in DRA4WfMS documents pool will not be lost. The basic idea to face this problem is to treat servers in a cloud system as untrusted in advance and apply replication to important data [22], [23], [24], [25]. From a market perspective, it is unlikely that server providers will agree on an easy and standardized way to access services, as this would give clients total freedom in changing providers, leading to increased open and direct competition with other  providers. We think it is reluctant for a company to place its WfMS in the cloud unless the company can migrate and replicate the process instances on his own without the need for the supporting of the cloud provider.

First, if the company is not satisfied with the service given by the service provider, it should have the full control to switch to another service provider on his own. For the switching, the company usually has to migrate the process instances for running processes and finished processes because it has to continue unfinished processes and finished processes contain important data. Second, even if the service provider offers some kind of SLAs such as availability. The customer may still feel that the loss of any process instances for executing and finished processes is not acceptable at any situation. Given the architecture shown in Figure 4, a participant can make backup copies of DRA4WfMS documents in some commodity cloud storage servers on his own as AEA can obtain these DRA4WfMS documents during activity execution. The duplication of process instances is easy and can be made without the assistance of the original service provider. Since we have backup for all the DRA4WfMS documents, we can easily migrate to another service provider.



VI. IMPLEMENTATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS In this section we present the experimental results. We  implement the DRA4WfMS documents pool and portal server according to Figure 4. The DRA4WfMS documents pool is implemented in Hadoop. The portal server is an Apache server which communicates with AEA via HTTP protocol. We build a Hadoop clusters to implement the DRA4WfMS documents pool which consists of five PCs, five nodes, each with 3.0GHz Intel Core 2 Quad processor, 2 GB of RAM, 500 GB of hard disk, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS operating system, and Java Development Kit 6.

We perform experiments to evaluate the concurrent capability of processing transactions from a large number of participants. When a participant wants to do their task, it needs to connect to one of the portal servers. However, we only have a single DRA4WfMS documents pool as all the process instances are stored in a big table for the cross- enterprise and multitenancy requirement. Therefore, it is very likely that the DRA4WfMS documents pool may have to process many concurrent transactions from participants.

We measure the response time with different amount of participants and different amount of documents. We have the AEA, portal servers, and DRA4WfMS documents pool locate in the same network segment. We set the number of documents in the pool to be 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000. When there is only one participant, the response time for processing a single transaction, which is either ?Read? or ?Write? randomly, is less than 350 ms in all the situations. The worst case is that we have 1000 participants to access a DRA4WfMS documents pools with 10,000 process instances, where the minimal, average, and maximal response time is 919 ms, 11413 ms, and 21907 ms, respectively.

VII. RELATED WORK  Recently, many researchers tried to propose novel architecture for cloud-based WfMSs. Pathirage et al.

proposed a Multi-tenant Architecture for BPEL [16]. They motivated the importance of multitenancy WfMSs. It uses Apache ODE [38] as its BPEL execution run-time. The proposed multi-tenant architecture leverages the multi-tenant support of the Carbon architecture [39]. Anstett et al.

addressed the issue of execution BPEL processes in the cloud [40]. Muthusamy and Jacobsen addressed the issue of scalability for cloud WfMS [41]. In their architecture, centralized engine can be replicated and the process instances balanced among the replicas whereby even individual process instances are executed in a distributed manner. Mao et al. considered the features of distributed heterogeneous environment on the cloud for deploying cloud-oriented WfMSs [42]. They proposed a new dynamic cloud scheduling algorithm which takes consideration of the characteristics of cloud workflow and cloud resources. Lins and Stephenson et al. presents an environment to collaboratively model business processes considering security requirements and to automatically deploy them in the Cloud with security requirements enforcement [43]. In their framework, the client company must trust the service provider as security is enforced by the engine servers in the cloud. Liu et al. pointed the current workflow systems have two critical issues: resource scalability and decentralized management [44]. They proposed a peer-to-peer based Cloud workflow system for managing large scale workflow applications. However, their framework cannot support  nonrepudiation for execution of activities and untrusted cloud environment.

The research work for constructing application on untrusted servers mainly concentrates on the application of cloud storage. One way to recover from a malicious server corrupting the persistent store is to replicate the data on several servers [22], [23], [24], [25]. Replication on multiple servers can ensure preservation of data even when many of the servers are malicious. With client-side process instance migration and replication and the security mechanism of DRA4WfMS, the client can employ untrusted server to constructs trustworthy WfMSs in the cloud.



VIII. CONCLUSION In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for Cloud-  based WfMSs. First of all, combining element-wise encryption and embedding chained digital signatures in process instances, our system satisfies major security requirements of authentication, confidentiality, data integrity, and nonrepudiation. Second, the proposed system supports multitenancy. All the process instances can be placed in a single pool with data security and isolation being fulfilled by it security mechanism. For execution isolation, the executions of activities are performed in the AEA of client side so that the tenant execution is independent from the others?. Third, in addition to multitenancy, the controlled data sharing makes it suitable to be a cross-enterprise WfMS which can provide workflow enactment service in cloud collaboration by exchanging data between users. Fourth, a multitenant system will inevitably accept a large number of requests and therefore has to be scalable. We study how to employ the BigTable to store the process instances and implement the required operations for workflow execution in BigTable. Our system is scalable as it can operate even when the process instances from participants of multitenancy organizations form a big data. Finally, as the best of our knowledge, our system is the first one which addresses problems of the untrusted server in the cloud-based WfMSs.

The client-side controlled process instance migration and replication together with the security mechanism in our system make it possible for client organizations to utilize untrusted cloud infrastructures to implement cross-enterprise WfMSs by cloud collaboration. The implementation and experiments demonstrate the feasibilities of the proposed system.
