I. INTRODUCTION Recently, with the development of computer technology  and IT (Information Technology), human-beings are entering into the information era, in which we are in dire need of some new tools and technologies to deal with such ?mass? data, picking up useful information automatically from these data to solve the ?data plenty, useful spare? problem ?information explosion? takes to us. Therefore, how to dig up the valuable information in the data sea and apply this information into the practical work becomes the problem needs to be solved urgently, which leads to the emersion of data mining technology. Meanwhile, the economic globalization and rapid development of electronic commerce is changing the original competition rules between the enterprises with an unprecedented scope and depth. More and more enterprises start to focus on a new marketing management theory?customer relationship management (CRM), which places the retaining and upgrading of customer value as the core of enterprise organic development [1]. With a mass of business data and customer information, how to pick up useful information and maximize customer value becomes the key customer relationship management problem needs to be solved urgently for modern enterprises. Data Mining is just the very tool suitable to solve this problem.



II. DATA MINING Data mining, which is also called KDD (Knowledge  Discovery in Database), is the process of abstracting unaware, potential and useful information and knowledge from plentiful, incomplete, noisy, fuzzy and stochastic actual data  [2]. Simply speaking, it is a process to pick up the information and knowledge which can not be discovered directly but with potential value from a mass of data. Data Mining is an interdisciplinary with extensive knowledge scope, which mainly involved into three areas: database, artificial intelligence and probability and mathematical statistics. For the detailed application, the data mining has powerful data analysis and process capability, which can discover knowledge as useful rules, regulations, relationship and modes from a mass of data, by means of concept description, clustering analysis, classification and forecast, similar pattern analysis, abnormal pattern analysis, association analysis, time sequence analysis and regression analysis, etc.

As a new interdisciplinary, data mining has an extensive application prospect. Recently with the network popularization and increasing mature of e-commerce, tremendous amounts of historical data and real-time data as well as widely application requirement in the business area provide a wide space for the application and development of data mining. The combination of data mining and existing information system together with the artificial intelligence provides important tools and theories for the analysis and process of business and financial data. As the new business information process technology, data mining is an advanced data analysis method, whose main characteristic is to clean, select, transform and analyze the huge number of business data in the commercial data base and modeling process, at last extract the key data which can assist the commercial decision [3].

Data mining theory and tool have already been adopted in every walk of life, and developed pretty good in some areas as engineering development, scientific research and commercial management in mobile, bank, telecom, insurance, retail, etc. It can solve all the following problems in financial and commercial areas: credit class evaluation; financial and economic forecast; security price fluctuation forecast; bankruptcy and bank liquidation forecast; malignant overdraft and commercial fraud discrimination; selection and classification of security and investment; commercial action analysis and sale and customer relation analysis. With the updating of management theory, CRM is becoming the focus of enterprises, and the main content of this thesis is just research on the application of data mining in customer relationship management.



III. CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT Customer relationship management is a new management  mechanism focuses on the improving of relationship between enterprises and customers, and also a strategy to develop new customers and maintain customer loyalty. It means that on the basis of continuous accumulating, analyzing and making use of the complete customer information, the enterprises distribute the enterprise resources reasonably in customer-oriented work mode and by system to provide support and standard management to meet customer needs in all aspects, which can result in the improvement of customer satisfaction and loyalty and make the greatest profit for the enterprises [3]. The final task of CRM is to provide a basis for the enterprises business management and decision-making by active market research and analysis and process of customer information.

With the rapid development of Internet and continuously deepening of enterprises information, the data amount enterprises need to deal with becomes more and more.

Therefore, to maximize the use of information resources to manage and influence the enterprise decision-making process becomes the key determinant whether or not an enterprise can maximize its competition advantage.

In fact, the customer relationship management is developed on the basis of early database marketing. In the early database marketing stage, the enterprises realized that plenty of customer information in hand will take them great profit. So the enterprises established large-scale customer information databases in their continuous customer information gathering process. At the same time, they also wanted to improve the customer loyalty to their enterprises by marketing activities as consumption points and price sales promotion, but the result of such activities are not satisfying. Therefore, the successful marketers have already realized that the key of marketing is to guide the customers? activities in long term, enhance the relationship between enterprises and customers, establish and efficiently manage the relationship between customers and enterprises. This is a marketing method, but exceeds the scope of marketing, it is to establish a bilateral relationship between customers and enterprises, and realize the bilateral relationship both in customer interest and enterprise profit to maximize the value of customers and enterprises [4].



IV. DATA MINING IS THE CORE TECHNOLOGY OF CRM The objective of modern enterprises CRM is to analyze the  huge number of customer information by database establishing, application of data mining, business intelligence and other technology methods to convert the valuable customer information into customer knowledge. Data mining is the core technology in customer relationship management.

A.  Customer Relationship Management Process At first, we preprocess the customer basic information data,  sales promotion activity data and daily sales data. Secondly we clean these data to remove noise and inconsistent data. Then we integrate the data, select the data relevant to the analysis task and transform data into forms appropriate for data mining.

Since the data are prepared, they need to be analyzed. On this basis, select appropriate data mining methods and tools  according to the commercial problem needs to be solved and data need to be analyzed, establish model, process and analyze these data and finally get the information which can assist decision-making. The detailed process is shown in Fig. 1.

B.  Applications of Data Mining in CRM At present, data mining mainly has the following  applications in the customer relationship management system:  1) Customer Classification Analysis Customer classification is also called customer  subdivision, which is to divide the customer by customer gender, occupation, age, or customer consumption habit and purchase habit. The data mining technology can divide the huge number of customers into different groups, according to which the customer-oriented products and services are provided. The most common methods are classification and clustering.

2) Customer Gaining Analysis The development of enterprise need new customer  enlisted. By the use of data mining technology, the enterprises can identify the potential customers by analyzing the characteristics of customers in hand and their purchase activities to make more targeted sales plan. The common methods are classification forecast and association analysis.

3) Customer Losing and Maintaining Analysis Enterprises development needs to continuously acquire  new customers, but old customers maintaining is even more important. Many research results indicate that the cost to win a new customer is several times more than the cost to maintain an old customer, so the old customer maintaining must be taken into consideration if an enterprise want to achieve stable development. The data mining technology can help to analyze the customer lost characteristics, establish corresponding model, and find out the potential customer may be lost by this model. After aware of which customers may be lost, the enterprise can adopt corresponding measures to maintain the customers and improve their satisfaction.

4) Customer Profit-making Ability Analysis and Forecast There is a classic two-eight law in customer relationship  management, that is, eighty percent of the customers will bring in twenty percent of the enterprise profit, while the other twenty percent of customers will accomplish the left eighty percent. The customers in this twenty percent bring much more profit for the enterprise, so they are the customers enterprises should care most. By analyzing customer information and deal data, we can find out these customers in the twenty and provide special service for them to improve customer loyalty and try to dig out the potential ?golden customers? by making use of the twenty customer model.

Figure 1.   Process of customer relationship management  5) Cross Selling Analysis The relationship between modern enterprises and  customers is always changing. In order to improve the enterprise loyalty of customers, the enterprises need cross selling on existing customers, which is, providing new products or services for customers by analyzing the customer characteristics and the purchased products or services characteristics. In data mining, the cross selling analysis is always proceeded by the use of association rule.

6) Customer Satisfaction Analysis The analyzing of customer satisfaction on enterprises  products and services can help the enterprises to improve customer marketing strategy, thereby increase customer loyalty. Data mining can analyze customer satisfaction from scattered customer feedback information.

7) Customer Credit Analysis Data mining can analyze detailed customer credit class  from huge number of historical data, according to which the enterprises can adopt different account sale strategies for customers with different credit class [5].



V. KEY TECHNOLOGIS OF DATA MINING APPLIED IN CRM  A. Clustering Clustering is just as the normal saying that ?things of one  kind come together?, that is, to classify a group of individuals into several groups. Its aim is to make the distance between the individuals of the same group as short as possible, and the distance between the individuals of different groups as far as possible [6]. Clustering analysis can find out the data distribution mode and proper inter relationship between data properties from the macroscopical view, search for the useful relation between the object data in certain data set and divide the records in database into a series of meaningful subclass.

The clustering methods can be divided into the following  types by different dividing methods: based on division, as K-Means, K-Medoids; based on level, as BIRCH, CURE; based on density, as DBSCAN, OPTICS [7].

To make it simple, clustering is a division on customer group ? to classify the similar customers and divide the dissimilar customers into different groups. By clustering analysis on customers of different backgrounds and their various spending habits, spending activities and spending psychology, the enterprises can find customer groups of different characteristics, and can describe the customer groups of different characteristics by purchase modes, which can help enterprises to make more efficient marketing strategy, select marketing channels and create different advertising campaigns, in order to realize the aim of improving relationship between enterprises and customers, forecasting the future trend and activities and supporting enterprises decision-making. The clustering analysis is mainly used in customer classification analysis and is the basis of efficient sale, marketing and service [6]. Thus can be seen that clustering analysis is the premise of customer profit-making ability analysis and forecast. The efficient marketing plan can only be developed on the basis of exact customer classification, and get twice the result with half the effort, to realize the aim of maximize customer value and get more return.

B. Classification and Forecast Different from clustering analysis, classification analysis  means study under instruction, and classifies the unknown data into some known, pre-defined category according to the concepts of different categories, and uses this description to construct category model (normally indicated by regulation or decision-making tree mode). The category description and classification model can be acquired by making use of exercise dataset through certain algorithm. Classification can also be called attribute forecast, that is, classify the data into the most proper category. Main algorithms are: decision-making tree, Bayesian statistics, BP neural networks, Genetic Algorithm, rough set theory, fuzzy set theory and so on.

This method is widely used in customer classification by analyzing the data in sample customer database and making exact description for each category to establish different customer models. The future new customers can also be classified in the existing categories for the enterprise to affirm the customers? hobbies, consumption habits, consumption inclinations, consumption requirements and so on, make the ?fitted? marketing program for the customer, establish one-to-one customer service system and perform diversified customer management. For example, in the network insurance sale, with the data mining technology, we can use the self-study function of neural network to classify customers to find the most suitable insurance type for the customer. As soon as the customer inputs his information, the most suitable insurance for him will pop up [8].Classification method can also forecast the consumption activities of new customers and establish forecast model, analyze the customers with similar activities in different conditions and filter the future potential customers. By making use of classification method, the enterprises can classify these potential customers in the    existing categories, if these customers can not bring profit or make deficit, they will be abandoned; if these customers can bring profit to the enterprise, then the enterprise needs to combine the resources and services these customer interested and provide positive and individual service, converting the potential customer into former customer. The application of classification is shown in Fig. 2.

C. Association Rules The association rule mining is first put forward by Rakesh,  Apwal, etc. If the values of two or more than two variables (e.g. different character fields in database) have certain rule, it is called association. Data association is a kind of important and available knowledge in the database, while association analysis is to find out item or pattern which turns up with high frequency in certain data sets, just as knowledge of ?70% of customer buys commodity B together with commodity A in one shopping?. Mining interesting association relations from plenty of commercial records can assist the decision-making.

The most classic application of association rule used in data mining area is shopping basket analysis, and the most famous shopping basket practice is the ?diaper and beer? story of Wal-Mart.

The association analysis is a powerful tool to realize cross selling. Cross selling is a marketing strategy to sell a new product or service to the customer who already used the products of the same enterprise. To introduce a new product or service to a new customer and an old customer, the old customer is more likely to accept it and the success rate is higher. Therefore, cross selling is a marketing method based on enterprise and customer win-win mode. Meanwhile, cross selling is also a marketing method which can improve customer value, for the more the relations between the enterprise and the customer, the more dependent the customer will be on the enterprise, and the higher the loyalty will be. By use of association method, banks analyze the association relations between the deal activities and other properties (as customer age, gender, education, occupation, etc), and can get the result which bank services or financial products the customer will be interested in, which financing products and services is likely to be chosen in one deal, and then apply efficient cross selling and improve the bank customer value [9]. Cross selling is an efficient marketing method, which can help to retain old customers and improve customer loyalty.

VI. CONCLUSIONS In modern society, customer becomes the most important  asset of enterprise. Efficient customer relationship management is the necessary method to improve enterprise competition advantage. At present, the local researches on CRM mainly focus on CRM system structure research, CRM value evaluation and calculation, CRM management modes and application of data mining and mathematical statistics methods in CRM and other aspect [10]. While the data mining application research in CRM has become the common focus of academia and business circles. By use of data mining technology, rules and patterns can be extract from a mass of data, but how to explain and apply these rules and patterns is the key point enterprises care about and also the determinant factor to assist the enterprise decision-making.
