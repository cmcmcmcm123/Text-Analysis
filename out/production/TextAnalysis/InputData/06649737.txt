Integrating RESTful Service into BPEL Business Process   on Service Generation System

Abstract?New value-added business, generated by Web service composition in BPEL, provides more powerful and flexible features. SOAP-based web services invoked in BPEL are heavy with redundant information and lower performance. RESTful Web service is brought forward to new value-added business as an alternative solution. However, it?s a big challenge to compose RESTful Web services with SOAP-based Web Services in SOA BPEL business processes. BPEL is not designed to use RESTful Web services because these types of services do not use WSDL to describe themselves. This paper proposes a novel approach for integrating RESTful Web services and SOAP-based Web services in business processes described in BPEL. The approach is applied to a practical multimedia conference BPEL process, and the experimental data show the stability of the new RESTful BPEL process with a higher performance.

I. INTRODUCTION Service composition composes fine-grained services into  coarse-grained services which have a practical meaning on business. Composing multiple web services is more beneficial to users than a single service [1]. BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) is the most popular language for composing web services to provide enterprise business. It orchestrates standard SOAP web services to achieve the business goal. Traditional SOAP-based Web services are designed with a common XML-based protocol, which is heavier than before as a series of WS-* protocol are defined.

This results to a mature SOAP web service technology with redundant information and a lower performance.

REST (Representational State Transfer) has gained widespread acceptance across the Web as a simpler alternative to SOAP Web Services. Since it is simple to publish and use a RESTful Web service, more and more Web 2.0 service providers?including Yahoo and Google shift their interface design from SOAP and WSDL-based interfaces to a simpler, resource-oriented REST style.

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that treats the Web as a resource-centric application.

RESTful Web services are currently perceived as a lightweight mean to enable point-to-point integration between service providers and a large number of clients [2]. It is widespread used for its simplicity and usability. Most Web 2.0 websites provide their own web services that are realized in REST fashion for its usability and simplicity. Programmable Web shows that a whopping 73 percent of APIs registered on their  site are REST-based while only 16 percent offer SOAP. More and more research work compare SOAP-based web services with RESTful Web services. Fatna Belqasmi et.al reviews the state of the art of RESTful-based service provisioning in next generation networks. It also provides an evaluation of the overall suitability of RESTful web services for service provisioning in next generation networks and discusses research directions [12]. C. Pautasso et.al [13] objectify the WS-* vs. REST debate by giving a quantitative technical comparison based on architectural principles and decisions.

They show that the two approaches differ in the number of architectural decisions that must be made and in the number of available alternatives. As the rapid development of RESTful Web services, SOA is evolving to embrace new ways of working.

A big challenge for using RESTful Web services in SOA business is how to compose RESTful Web services with SOAP-based Web Services in SOA business processes, that is, how to orchestrate web services which are mixture of both SOAP based and RESTful services to achieve one common goal. BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) [3], a popular technology of Web services orchestration based on process, has its own limitation that it is not designed to use RESTful Web services because these types of services do not use WSDL (Web Service Definition Language) to describe themselves. There is still no standard specification to define business process for both RESTful Web services and SOAP-based Web services  On the basis of previous work [14], we propose a new approach for integrating RESTful Web services and SOAP-based Web services in business processes described in BPEL. The approach uses apache extensions to wrap a WSDL document for a RESTful Web service in order to allow BPEL to invoke RESTful Web services as same as SOAP-based Web services. At the same time, RESTful Web services are invoked by sending HTTP requests instead of SOAP message. The innovative advantages of the proposed RESTful Web service integration approach are:  ? RESTful Web service can be invoked in standard BPEL business processes without any modification of BPEL elements.

? RESTful Web services are still invoked by HTTP requests, in that way the simplicity and efficiency of using RESTful Web services are preserved in BPEL business processes.

DOI 10.1109/SCC.2013.70     With these advantages, the proposed approach can be simply used in current standard BPEL execution environment without any modification of BPEL specification. It has a high usability and operability.

This paper is organized as follows. First in Sections 2 we give related work on RESTful Web services and their invocation in business process. In section 3 we introduce a novel approach for integrating RESTful web services in BPEL processes. In section 4 we illustrate the service generation system developed by us that supports the proposed approach.

We then apply the approach to practical multimedia conference BPEL processes on our service generation system in section 5, and compare our approach with traditional approaches on performance through a series of tests, and present and analyze the experimental result. In Section 6 we draw our experiences and conclude the paper.



II. RELATED WORK The Web Services Business Process Execution Language  (BPEL) is the de facto standard for service-based business processes. It is accepted and widely used in industry. However, WS-BPEL process model is layered on top of the service model defined by WSDL 1.1 [7]. In other words, the WS-BPEL and the WSDL languages are tightly coupled [4].

Although SOAP-based Web services have a WSDL document, resources published by a RESTful Web service are exposed using a fine-grained addressing mechanism: the Uniform Resource Identifier [2]. The publication of WSDL 2.0, which was designed with RESTful Web services in mind, as a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation means there is now a language to describe RESTful Web services [5]. But in fact WSDL2.0 is not widely supported at present, this situation enforces us to look for other approaches.

Since traditional service composition language has so many problems to be solved in composing RESTful Web services, many research works turn to finding a new way to implement the composition of RESTful Web services and SOAP-based Web services. A new language, namely JOpera visual composition language, is proposed to build a composite application (DoodleMap) out of some well-known, public and currently existing RESTful service APIs in [2]. The language has a set of language features that are required for RESTful services: dynamic late binding, dynamic typing, content-type negotiation, state inspection, and compliance with the uniform interface principle.

And in industry, WSO2 Mashup Server [15] uses Web services including RESTful and SOAP-based Web services as the mechanism for acquiring data, XML (Extensible Markup Language) as its central abstraction, JavaScript (with E4X XML extensions) for manipulating that data, and again Web services as the primary way to republish the new information stream. These languages indeed give us more choices, but the disadvantages are also obvious:  ? Exactly, they are not business process language and could not implement complicated logical control to describe the process.

? They do not make for a natural programming model, when it comes to RESTful Web Services.

? No standard service composition description specification is proposed, which brings a confused condition in real application. As a result, they are not widely used in industry.

BPEL can be the standard way to connect and manage SOAP-based Web services and RESTful Web service, and it is easier for enterprise to accept because of it is the defacto standard. However, there are several challenges in invoking RESTful Web services by BPEL for the difference with traditional SOAP-based Web services, such as no service description document. Different approaches were proposed to solve these problems.

In [4], JOpera researchers propose a lightweight BPEL extension to natively support the composition of RESTful Web services using business processes and discusses how to expose the execution state of a business process so that it can be manipulated through REST primitives in a controlled way. It will become much easier to invoke RESTful Web services by using new service invocation activities in the modified BPEL specification. Theoretically, it is feasible and efficient.

However, there are no obvious signs showing that it will be put into practice recently.

A framework named REST2SOAP is presented to integrate SOAP services and RESTful services in [6]. REST2SOAP leverages WADL specification, and can wrap RESTful services into SOAP services semi-automatically. Using REST2SOAP, developers can create a BPEL service that combines SOAP, RESTful services and user interfaces simultaneously. It solves the problems and challenges brought by RESTful Web services in service composition. On the other hand, the advantages of RESTful Web services, such as efficiency and ease of use, are also abandoned. For developers who prefer to use RESTful Web services, that is not a good solution.

In [16] the author presents a hybrid orchestration approach that makes use of the heterogeneous nature of the services (e.g, SOAP services and RESTful services) for efficient orchestration. The proposed system contains both a BPEL engine and a REST orchestration engine. A big workflow is divided into several sub-workflows according to services they invoke. SOAP-based orchestration is conducted in the BPEL engine, and REST services are orchestrated in the REST orchestration engine. The whole business process is assembled by the invocations. It is complex to preserve two orchestration engines in order to execute one workflow, and the division of the big workflow is also time-consuming.



III. RESTFUL WEB SERVICES FOR BPEL Web Services Business Process Execution Language  Version 2.0 (WS-BPEL 2.0 for short) is defined on the basis of WSDL 1.1 specification. It acquires necessary information about services, such as input, output, and address, from WSDL document, which is provided by each service. A weakness of RESTful Web services is that no standard service description document is provided. Although WSDL 2.0 and WADL (Web Application Description Language) could be used to describe     RESTful Web services, they are not popular and are not supported in WS-BPEL 2.0. This is the biggest challenge we have to overcome.

WS-BPEL 2.0 is widely used in enterprise, so modifying it to fit for RESTful Web services is unfeasible. Since BPEL requires each invoked service have a WSDL document, one solution is that we let each RESTful Web service provide a description document in WSDL 1.1 specification. The key problem is how to use WSDL to describe services information that fully match the semantics of a ?GET?, ?POST?, ?PUT?, or ?DELETE? request performed on a resource URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). Based on previous researches and tests, we try to generate a WSDL 1.1 document for RESTful Web services in order to make the Restful Web service invocation in BPEL possible.

In WSDL 2.0 specification, RESTful Web services are supported with the help of definition of four basic HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) methods. The foundation of WS-BPEL 2.0 is WSDL 1.1. However, descriptions for HTTP GET and POST are also available in WSDL 1.1 specification.

WSDL 1.1 includes a binding for HTTP?s GET and POST verbs in order to describe the interaction between a Web Browser and a web site. This allows applications other than Web Browser to interact with the site [8]. As for the other two verbs, PUT and DELETE, they are not involved and have to be specially considered. Apache ODE Project [8] has implemented the extension of WSDL 1.1 to support RESTful Web services and it can be used to describe HTTP PUT and DELETE verbs. By using the extension, a WSDL 1.1 document for RESTful Web services could be constructed.

Although RESTful Web services could have WSDL documents as same as SOAP-based Web services, their invocation methods in execution are different. For traditional SOAP-based Web services, execution engine would send SOAP message which is used over any transport protocol such as HTTP, SMTP and so on. However, for RESTful Web services, it directly uses HTTP protocol for communication.

Namely, they work on different level.

RESTful Web Services defined four basic operations, GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, on resources. To generate a WSDL document, each verb is needed to be described even though the service address is the same. In another word, a RESTful Web service including four verbs is wrapped into four basic service elements described in a WSDL document as one Web service.

Since the four verbs are not all supported in WSDL 1.1 specification, they are divided into two groups for different handling.

A. GET & POST Currently only GET and POST verbs are supported in web  page forms. For GET and POST verbs of RESTful Web services, it can be described by WSDL 1.1 specification [8].

The following protocol specific information may be specified:  ? An indication that a binding uses HTTP GET or POST  ? An address for the port  ? A relative address for each operation (relative to the base address defined in the port)  Following the specification, a WSDL document for GET or POST verb of RESTful Web services that indicates the input, output and address and other necessary information could be constructed. Figure 1. shows the finished WSDL document for SMS service which uses POST verb.

Figure 1. WSDL for POST Verb  Compares with WSDL for SOAP Web services, GET/POST is specified in WSDL for Restful Web services by the following specific elements in bold:  <binding?> //a concrete protocol and data format specification  for a particular port type.

<http:binding verb = ?GET(or POST)?/> <operation...>  //the particular PortType?s specific agreements and data type specifications  <http:operation location=?uri?> <input?>  ?? mime elements ? </input> <output?>  ? mime elements ? </output>  </operation> </binding>  <service?> //a collection of related endpoints.

<port?>  // a single endpoint defined as a combination of a binding and a network address.

<http:address location=?uri?/> </port>  </service>  Take the SMS RESTful service in multimedia conference application as an example,  ? It uses POST verb, <http:binding verb=?POST?>  ? The location attribute specifies a relative URI for the operation. This URI is combined with the URI specified in the http:address element to form the full URI for the HTTP request. The URI value must be a relative URI.

? To avoid having to define a new element for every MIME format, the mime:content element may be used if there is no additional information to convey about the format other than its MIME type string. More information about MIME Binding is described in [7].

B. PUT & DELETE PUT and DELETE verbs is not considered in WSDL 1.1.

So extensions are needed. Apache ODE which executes business processes written following the WS-BPEL standard brings four extensions to better describe RESTful Web services: one HTTP method per operation (instead of one per binding), a unique URI Template for all operations, access to HTTP headers, and fault support. It supports GET, POST, PUT and DELETE description in WSDL 1.1 Extension for REST in the Apache ODE 1.2 and later versions. So we could use the extensions to describe all verbs. But another problem is that how to identify these extensions that are not defined in the standard WSDL 1.1 specification, the execution environment needs to understand what they stand for. Apache ODE 1.2 and later versions supports BPEL execution invocation of Restful Web services specified in WSDL 1.1 Extension for REST. But for RESTful Web services that only uses GET and POST, the extensions are not recommended for its limitation of execution environment, because only in certain versions of Apache ODE, these extensions could be analyzed and understood, other BPEL execution environment versions do not support the extensions. So for RESTful web services that only uses GET and POST, we recommend to follow the method in the above section A, in that way, they can be invoked in any standard BPEL execution environment.

Apache ODE has declared all extensions in its own namespace. Detailed specifications of description can be found at the site [9]. Figure 2 shows a WSDL document for DELETE verb. Obviously, the odex namespace is necessary, so the <odex:binding  verb=?DELETE?> can be valid. Similarity, ?PUT? verb can also be described in the RESTful WSDL.

Figure 2. WSDL for DELETE Verb  C. Data After four basic operations are clearly described, another  key point data which are mainly input and output information should be considered. RESTful Web services provide a variety  of data format, such as xml, json and so on. The format is decided by developers and can be declared in the document.

However, the BPEL execution environment which interacts with RESTful Web services in business process execution has to support and resolve the data format.

At present, BPEL only supports WSDL1.1, in WSDL1.1 JSON can be invalid. Users had better transfer JSON data format to XML or String format.

After a WSDL document is wrapped, RESTful Web services could be invoked in BPEL process just as SOAP-based Web services. Figure 3. illustrates how to invoke RESTful Web services in BPEL.

Figure 3. RESTful Web Services for BPEL.

In general, it?s similar to invoke the RESTful Web Services with wrapped WSDL as invoking the Web Services with ordinary WSDL. A RESTful Web service has to be wrapped through a WSDL interface in order to invoke them from a BPEL process. The specific RESTful Web Services invoking procedure is as follows. First, create a BPEL project and a process in it. Then create a partner link to indicate the interaction between the BPEL process and the RESTful Web services. After that, choose the corresponding operation in the selection area. The input and output variables would also need you to set. In a word, use the invoke action in the BPEL process to invoke other Web services, and set all the options it need, such as partner link, partner link type, role name and so on.



IV. SERVICE GENERATION SYSTEM The proposed approach enables the integration of RESTful  Web services and SOAP-based Web services in BPEL. It can be implemented on Service Generation System (SGS for short) developed by us, which is designed to support service composition, service management and service execution. In the following parts of this section, we will discuss the key point for implementing RESTful Web services invoking by BPEL on SGS.

SGS is a novel system for description, composition and management of various types? services. By compositing services that stored in the system or created new, developers could develop new services quickly and efficiently to fulfill user requests. Then services are allowed to deploy in the system and finally services could receive requests and complete their tasks. Based on function, SGS is divided into three parts:     Service Development Platform in client side, Service Management Platform and Service Execution Environment in server side, which is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4. Service Generation System.

A. Service Development Platform (SDP) SDP is designed as a rich client for its complex functions.

Its main purpose is to provide a visual toolkit for developers to composite services in an efficient way. As WS-BPEL has been the most popular standard in practice, SDP involves a BPEL editor based on BPEL Designer Project [10] which allows developers to build processes thorough drag and drop existed services of different granularity. Therefore WS-BPEL mainly supports machine-to-machine communication without involving human tasks. Because of the limitation of BPEL, SDP also provides a jPDL editor which uses another workflow language to allow developers to have more solutions.

Another important task of SDP is to communicate with server. It can retrieve existed services based on users? requests from Service Management Platform and upload new services created by users. With the growing of services library, the chance of services discovery is much bigger. On the other hand, the reusability of services is also improved. SDP can send commands to Service Execution Environment to deploy the created services and run them. Except that, SDP still needs to provide basic user login interface.

B. Service Management Platform (SMP) SMP is a common service management platform for multi  user sharing in collaboration environment. Semantic annotation and classification based on ontology are used in the platform to provide an interface of service storage, service discovery and service recommendation for developers. It mainly communicates with Service Development Platform and provides services through it. In general, SMP implements three functions as follows:  ? Service management: to manage various types of services efficiently based on specific policy, such as classification based on ontology. A good expansibility is necessary to support dynamic extension of service types.

? User account management: to distribute permissions of manipulating resources to all users based on different roles. Through the permission control, the security and stability of system is improved.

? Cooperation control: to coordinate different users? action and solve conflictions during the developing process. Multi user development is well supported by the dynamic control of services.

SMP is designed on server which results to a large service library among all users. At the same time, a web interface for administrators and web services for SDP are both provided.

The detailed policy is discussed in [11].

C. Service Execution Environment (SEE) SEE is the runtime environment for services which could  execute processes correctly. It is designed as a container on server side. As the foundation of system, it needs a high reliability and stability to guarantee quality of services. SEE retrieve all necessary documents from Service Development Platform and deploy them into execution engine according to users? commands. SEE is asked to support the explanation and execution of different language specification for the diversity of development on Service Development Platform.

SDP, SMP and SEE are three mainly part of Service Generation System and they work together to provide a complete solution to developers from developing to executing.

Everyone will not only be a service customer but also a service provider in system. And finally this would result to a high improvement on service development.

D. Extensions RESTful Web services would be registered into SMP,  composed with SOAP-based Web services in SDP and finally invoked in SEE. Different with SOAP-based services, RESTful Web services need an additional step to wrap a WSDL document for it. As a result, SDP is extended to provide a wizard to wrap WSDL documents semi-automatically for RESTful Web services. In this section, SDP is introduced with providing two types editors, namely BPEL editor and jPDL editor. However, the approach is only related with BPEL editor.

Actually these extensions are implemented on the BPEL editor.

RESTful Web services do not have a standard description specification that results to impossibility of generating WSDL documents automatically. Human interaction with the platform cannot be avoided. Users still need to tell the platform some basic information about services, including input, output and location and so on through a user-friendly wizard. Then the platform could complete the remaining work and generate WSDL documents following the specification. And after that, RESTful Web services could be invoked as same as SOAP-based Web services in the platform. Figure 5. shows the extended BPEL editor in Service Development Platform.

Figure 5. Extended BPEL Editor in Service Development Platform  This wizard for creating WSDL document for RESTful Web services is based on WSDL4, which can be used to create and analyze WSDL. The most important methods are:  ? Create a WSDL document  WSDLFactory wsdlFactory = WSDLFactory.newInstance();  ? Create the definition element  Definition definition = wsdlFactory.newDefinition();  ? Set the target namespace  definition.setTargetNamespace(?tns?); definition.setQName(new QName(tns,tns));  ? Add necessary namespace  definition.addNamespace(?tns?,tns);  ? Create WSDL element  Part part1 = definition.createPart(?partName?);  It?s the same as creating Message, Port, PortType, Input, Output, Binding, Operation and Service elements.

? Add element  message1.addPart(part1); the same as others.

? Set the input, output and operation type  operation.setInput(input); operation.setStyle(OperationType.REQUEST_RESPONSE);  OperationType.REQUEST_RESPONSE is corresponding to the four message switching methods.

? Set HTTP verb  httpBinding.setVerb(?POST?);  ? Indicates the interface service address  HTTPAddress httpAddress = new HTTPAddressImpl (); httpAddress.setLocationURI  (?http://example.org/helloService?);  port.addExtensibilityElement (httpAddress);  Figure 6. and Figure 7. show the wizard?s two pages. The wizard collects users? information about their services to finally generate the WSDL description file for RESTful web services.

If the input and output elements are very complex, users can modify them in the design view of the WSDL file or edit the file directly.

V. CASE STUDY In this section, a real multimedia conference business is  presented as a scenario to explain our motivation and verify the availability and performance of the proposed approach by testing the conference processes that integrat both SOAP web services and RESTful web services. Multimedia conference system allows people dispersed in geography to communicate with each other through voice, graph and other ways as same as a real conference. In the process of multimedia conference, the first step is that conference organizer creates a conference.

Then all participants should be invited. And before the conference will soon begin, a notification would be sent to each participant to notice them to enter the meeting room online.

Finally, the conference begins and another process would be triggered to manage the conference. Figure 8. shows the sample process.

Figure 8. Business Process for Multimedia Conference  In the notification sub-process, the system uses different ways to notice users based on whether they are online or not. If yes, a voice service provided in SOAP style would be invoked and if no, a SMS service provided by China Telecom in REST style would be invoked. This scenario obviously illustrated that the integration of RESTful Web services and SOAP-based Web services is necessary in a real business process. And developers use the Service Generation System (SGS), which is a rich development platform introduced in section IV to assist their work.

In general, RESTful Web services are wrapped to provide WSDL documents and then they could be used to compose business processes in Service Development Platform (SDP).

Finally, BPEL processes will be deployed and published to customers in Service Execution Environment (SEE).

A. Functionality The notification sub-process of multimedia conference  system mentioned above composes RESTful Web services with SOAP Web services using the proposed approach. The notification sub-process in BPEL consists of four web services.

The process is deployed in ServiceMix [11], an enterprise service bus, with Apache ODE as the process execution engine.

SoapUI which is the world leading Open Source Functional Testing Tool for Web Service Testing is used to simulate client to send SOAP message to start the process. Tomcat 6.0 is selected as the web container of web services. Through analyzing the runtime log information and the response message of process, we can verify that RESTful Web services are actually invoked and executed in the process. In another word, the proposed approach really works.

B. Performance Since the approach makes it possible to invoke RESTful  Web services in BPEL processes, we could compare processes that use RESTful Web services with the ones that use SOAP-based Web services only to find out the efficiency of the approach.

Firstly, several different processes need to be created. These processes should complete same task with same control logic and same functional services except that the services are REST style or SOAP style. In our experiments, five processes are  provided and each of them has different number of RESTful Web services. Process 1 only uses SOAP-based Web services, while process 2 replaces one SOAP-based Web service in process 1 with a RESTful Web service that has the same function. Process 3 replaces two SOAP-based services in process 2 with two RESTful Web services, each replacement pair has the same function, and the rest can be deduced by analogy. Through using different number of RESTful Web services in one BPEL process, we could conclude the improvement of performance it brings.

After the five processes are deployed in the same Service Execution Environment (SEE) with ServiceMix and ODE, soapUI is used to simulate multi users. In our experiment, the response time of each process when concurrently visited by 10 users, 50 users and 100 users are all recorded. Figure 9. shows the statistics data. The horizontal axis represents process 1 to process 5, and the vertical axis represents response time. Three lines with different color represent different amount of concurrent users.

Figure 9. Response Time of Visiting Processes Integrating Different Number of RESTful serivces  With the increasing of concurrent users, response time is also increased because of the limitation of resources. But there is a common point among three lines. Generally, the more RESTful Web services used in one process, the less the response time. The main reason is that traditional SOAP-based Web services are designed to send SOAP message which is an XML-based message based on transfer protocol, such as HTTP, while RESTful Web services are visited by directly HTTP requests. SOAP message parsing is time-consuming. For RESTful Web services, less transport information results to a higher performance. So RESTful Web services are recommended to be used in BPEL processes if exist.



VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, a new approach for BPEL to compose  RESTful Web services with SOAP-based Web services is proposed. The approach wrap a WSDL document for RESTful         1 2 3 4 5  Ti m  e (m  s)   10 users 50 users 100 users     Web services in order to allow BPEL to invoke RESTful Web services as same as SOAP-based Web services. RESTful services are invoked by sending HTTP requests instead of SOAP message. The WSDL wrapping of RESTful service is offered by our service generation system (SGS), as well as the orchestration of the SOAP services and RESTful services. The generated BPEL code can be executed in any environment that supports standard BPEL.

Different with JOpera work [2] and WSO2 Mashup Tool [15] in industry, the proposed approach uses standard business process language to compose SOAP and RESTful service, and the business process language is standard without any extension or modification. Only RESTful service verbs are wrapped as a WSDL description to enable the integration with SOAP Web services in BPEL. This makes the approach easy for developers to accept. The GET and POST verb wrapping of a RESTful service in standard WSDL 1.1 specification enables the simple and efficient RESTful service invocation by HTTP requests. As we know, a large proportion of the RESTful services only use GET and POST verbs. For PUT and DELETE verbs, we follow ODE WSDL 1.1 extension to specify and invoke the RESTful service. This is an improved approach different from ODE WSDL extension which uses WSDL 1.1 extension to specify all the four verbs of a RESTful service. We do not have to rely on certain versions of ODE for the RESTful service invocation, for RESTful services with GET and POST verbs only, we integrate it with SOAP services in BPEL in a standard way which can be executed in standard BPEL execution environment.

The greatest advantage of the proposed approach is that for a large proportion of RESTful services with only GET and POST verbs, it can be simply used in current BPEL execution environment without any modification of BPEL specification.

The real multimedia conference business process study verifies the high usability and operability of the proposed approach.

The overhead of the approach is the translation from SOAP message to HTTP message for invoking a RESTful service, and the wrapping of the RESTful service response HTTP message to SOAP message for replying the BPEL invocation.

In the future, more RESTful services should be invoked in real application?s BPEL process to test and enhance the stability of the execution of the BPEL process that integrate both SOAP services and RESTful services. From the testing experiences, we will conclude the proper kinds of services that are suitable for description in RESTful style and integration with SOAP services in BPEL.
