I.  INTRODUCTION Knowledge Discovery (KD) is one of the fast growing  computer science fields. Studies have shown that, KD research has gone from machine learning to machine discovery and then to KD stages. KD was brought into attention in 1989 during the IJCAI Workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) [1]. The workshops were then continued annually until 1994. In 1995, the International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining became the most important annual event for KD. The framework of KD was outlined in two books: ?Knowledge Discovery in Databases? [2] and ?Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining? [3].

Knowledge Discovery (KD) is a nontrivial process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns from large collections of data [4].

One of the KD steps is Data Mining (DM). DM is the step that is concerned with the actual extraction of knowledge from data, in contrast to the KD process that is concerned with many other things like understanding and preparation of the data, verification and application of the discovered knowledge. In practice, however, people use terms DM, KD, and DMKD as synonymous.

With the advent of information age and the knowledge economy, KD theory and technology have become key areas of computer applications, the scope of the study of KD is expanding, study heat is on the rise.

Some researchers of domestic and foreign have studied the research status, fronts and hot spots, development trends in the field of knowledge discovery(KD) in recent years.

Yang Bing-ru etal (2005) considered that the current international KDD research mainly on the knowledge discovery task description, knowledge evaluation and knowledge representation as the main line in order to effect  knowledge discovery algorithm as the center, which is a fairly long period of time to keep the mainstream tone[5].

Krzysztof J. Cios,Lukasz A. Kurgan ?2006?considered that  in addition to the design and implementation of a new DMKD framework, amore traditional course of action may have to be carried out . It includes design and implementation of a new generation of high performance DM systems that incorporate multiple DM methods , and are capable of mining heterogeneous sources of knowledge like multimedia data , can visualize the results, and handle huge amounts of complex data[6]. SUN Ji-hong and Jiao Yu-ying (2006) considers the key areas of knowledge discovery and trends in the following areas: text mining, data mining (query) language design, data cube data mining, concept knowledge base mining, knowledge discovery based on visualization, The new methods of mining complex data types, scalable methods of data mining. In addition, knowledge discovery and data privacy protection and information security, development of knowledge discovery language, a special query language and optimization of mining areas such as data mining are the future development trends[7]. Huang Zi-fei (2006) finds that, at present, the development trend of foreign KDD research are: research and enhanced Bayes and Boosting methods; the traditional statistical regression method in the KDD application; KDD is closely integrated with the database. In the application include KDD commercial software tools are created and improved focus on the establishment of problem-solving as a whole system rather than an isolated process[8]. Jin Zhan(2008) believes that knowledge discovery research focus has gradually shifted from the discovery methods to system applications, and focus on the integration of a variety of strategies and techniques, as well as the mutual penetration of various disciplines[9]. Yang Bing-ru (2008) thinks that the current trend of KD & DM research are: the original theory method of deepening and expansion; complex types (system) data mining has become a hot; the introduction of new technological methods (other disciplines penetration); theoretical study of fusion cross; the strengthening of basic theoretical research[10]. Li Jin-hua (2009) considers that under the grid environment a distributed KD will move towards a wider range and in large-scale data sets, and a wealth of knowledge discovery tools, a more intelligent knowledge discovery scheduling strategy, a higher degree of automation of knowledge found in stream process, more personalized knowledge services sectors as well[11].

However, the study mentioned above is basically a qualitative analysis, the result of subjective thought, but I intend to study the hot research topics and the research fronts in the field of International Knowledge discovery (KD) on the base of relevant literature, we will use Scientometrics method, from the perspective of knowledge mapping, mainly   DOI 10.1109/ICIE.2010.102         in quantitative analysis, and take qualitative analysis as a supplement, and hope that it will be benefit to the study of Knowledge discovery(KD).



II. DATA SOURCES AND RESEARCH METHODS The data used in the articles come from the documents in  Data Base Web of Science(SCI-EXPANDED?  SSCI? A&HCI), which is published by Institute for Scientific Information(ISI)in the United States.) ISI is the only international most authoritative source citation information, which is convenient for us to download data, transform data formats and analyze data. Data retrieval strategy is"TS (subject) = Knowledge discovery AND language=(English) AND document type=(Article) data base= SCI-EXPANDED ? SSCI? A&HCI AND time=1986-2009)", a total of 3987 articles are retrieved, and the date of the downloaded is March 10, 2010.

In this paper, knowledge mapping method which is method mainly in quantitative analysis is used[12][13]. With the information visualization software Citespace developed by Dr. Chen Chaomei [14], the article conically shows the image of the hot research topics and the research fronts in the field of international PIRM. Mapping knowledge can directly show us the compelling forefront of the field or the commanding heights of the subject in the knowledge or information through visual images, it can help people mining, analysis and display of scientific knowledge as well as the mutual relations between them, and we are able to more intuitively identify the evolution path of the forefront and the classic foundation documents in the subject) areas.

Analyze the co-cited authors, we can find the important core person and the academic relation between them[15] [16]. In addition, CiteSpace also has the capability of key words clustering and the burst words detection, so we can determine the research fronts and development trends of some research fields.



III. ANALYSIS  A. The key nodes in literature network in International KD in 1986-2009   We input all the 3987 "KD" documents published in  1986-2009 into Citespace, network nodes selected reference, the source of key words select title,  abstract, descriptors and identifiers, lexical item select noun phrases, adjusting threshold of the Citespace to (2, 2,20), (4, 3, 20), (4, 3, 20), and Select pathfinder algorithm, running Citespace. we got the documents published in 1986-2009co-cited Knowledge map in KD, shown in Figure 1, the bigger the font the more important the node that literature.

By Figure 1 we can clearly see the relationship between  the co-citation of classical literatures in the field of international knowledge discovery?KD?study. In this map we can see that five of the most prominent of the key nodes in literature, in Table 1. According to Dr. Chen Chaomei  definition, a total cited in the key nodes in the network map is a map to connect two or more different clusters, and the relative centrality and a higher cited node. These nodes may be the key points in the network from one time period to another period of time [17] .from the knowledge point of view, the key nodes are generally the classical literatures which point to an important new theory, or have a major theoretical innovation, are also the literatures which most likely to form a hot spot of cutting-edge scientific.

Table 1 The five key literatures in International Study of KD  in (1986-2009)   Cites Author Title Publication  year  Document  type  Contribution to  the node  130?  7810?  R. Agrawal,  T. Imielinski,  and A.N.

Quinlan, J.R Induction of  decision trees  1986 paper proposed the  ID3 decision  trees algorithm   Note: the number in small parentheses is the citation  frequency obtained through the google scholar, retrieval date is March 14, 2010.

As can be seen from Figure 1, according to the node in  the network were cited in the size of the view of the most prominent is ?Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases? written by R. Agrawal, T. Imielinski, and A.N. Swami in 1993.In the paper, Agrawal,etc. first proposed the association rules problem between item sets         when mining customer transaction database, and its core is recursive method based on the frequency of set theory, association rules is an important topic in the field of Data mining, which described the law of knowledge model in a transaction between items of simultaneous. [18]  Tied for second place the author is Quinlan, J.R?In 1993, he published a book??C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning", in which he proposed C4. 5 Algorithm improved version of ID3. The core idea of Decision Tree Algorithm is to use information entropy principle, select the properties of the maximum rate of information gain as a classification attribute, recursively construct the decision tree branches to complete the construction of decision tree. [19][20]  Came in third place is the"Fast algorithms for mining association rules in large databases" published in1994 written by Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R. in this article, R Agrawal proposed the well-known Apriori algorithm, which use the monotony of support to pruning the candidate sets, thereby greatly reducing the number of candidate sets and the computing time, many of the association rules algorithms followed by are based on Apriori algorithm or its variants.[21][22]  In addition?Breiman,L., Friedman,J.H., Olshen,R.A., and Stone,C.J proposed the CART(Classification and Regression Tree) in their book ? Classification and Regression Trees ? published in 1984.[23] Quinlan, J.R proposed the proposed the ID3Decision Tree Algorithm in his article ?Induction of decision trees?published in 1986.

[24] These documents are also the key and important literatures in the study of international knowledge discovery (KD) and in the center of knowledge map of knowledge discovery , and they played an important role to promote study of international knowledge discovery(KD).

B. Analysis of the international KD research topics  Use keywords in bibliographies, and with software  Citespace, we can determine the hot topics of international PIRM research. Although the keywords in an article are small in proportion, but they are the core and essence of the article, a highly condensed summary and concise of article theme, so the keywords of an article, especially the high frequency words are often used to determine the hot topics of some field[25] [26]. Citespace, writen in Java language, is a visualization software based on Co-citation Analysis.

Running this software, you can analysis and process the path of the Co-citation network of the scientific document citation by using the pathfinder algorithm [27] or minimum spanning trees algorithm [28] [29] , and you can also determine the main areas and hot topics of international KD study by high frequency words display.

We input all the 3987 "KD" documents published in 1986-2009 into Citespace, network nodes selected keyword, the source of key words select title,  abstract, descriptors and identifiers, lexical item select noun phrases, adjusting threshold of the Citespace to (2, 2,20), (4, 3, 20), (4, 3, 20), and Select pathfinder algorithm, running Citespace. After  sorted out, we got a list of key words that the total cites are more than 50 times(see table 2), as well as a knowledge map of the hot topics in international KD research in Figure 2.

Table 2 the keywords frequency > 50 in "KD" documents  nu  mbe  r  terms  eme  rgin  g  freq  uen  cy  nu  mb  er  terms  emergi  ng  freque  ncy  knowledge  discovery 541 7 current knowledge 71  2 data mining 305 8 new knowledge 68  3 drug discovery 138 9 gene expression 68  prior  knowledge 90 10 large database 61  5 neural network 81 11 recent discovery 51  6 association rule 80 12 binding site 50     Figure 2 shows the co-occurrence network of the high- frequency key words. From Figure 2 and Table 2, we can clearly see that the highest frequency term is knowledge discovery, the frequency is 541 times, followed by data mining, the frequency is 305 times, it shows that data mining and knowledge discovery inseparable, data mining is also the core and basis points of international KD study. The high- frequency keywords also show other hot topics of KD, including drug discovery ? prior knowledge ? neural network?association rule and so on. The particularly worth mentioning is that KD(data mining) applications in the medical field. KD(Data mining) technology provides a new thinking and methods for drug discovery.KD(data mining)technology can help researchers to discover the hidden knowledge in large database,, have a better, faster, more efficient decision-making, improve competitiveness, speed up the pace of drug discovery, improve the level of drug discovery.[30][31][32]? In addition, neural network, association rule is also the hot spots in the field of KD.

C. Research front and development trend of international KD  For the same 3987 "KD" articles published in 1986- 2009?with the burst detection technology and algorithm of Citespace, by the temporal distribution, detect out the burst terms,) rely on change trends of the terms frequency, not just the high or low of the frequency, to determine the research front and development trends in the field of international KD research [33]. Select network node: key term, and select burst phrases, then select the default threshold values (2, 2, 20), (4, 3, 20), (4, 3, 20), click find burst phrases, by running         Citespace, we can detect the first seven burst terms?false discovery rate?pharmaceutical industry?gene expression data ? binding site ? clustering algorithm ? genetic algorithm?potential discovery, as shown in Figure 3.



IV. CONCLUSIONS Since the concept of KD is known to the world, there are  more and more researches on KD&DM. By analyzing the 3987 papers of knowledge discovery (KD) published in 1986-2009 in Web of Science (SCI, SSCI, A&HCI) database ?we can draw the following conclusions:  (1)R. Agrawal, T. Imielinski, and A.N. Swami,Quinlan J.R,Agrawal,  R.  and  Srikant,  R Breiman,L., Friedman,J.H., Olshen,R.A., and Stone,C.J,Quinlan, J.R are the important literature authors in the field of knowledge discovery (KD).
