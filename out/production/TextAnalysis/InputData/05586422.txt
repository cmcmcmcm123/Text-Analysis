Generalized Rule Extraction and Traffic Prediction in the Optimal Route Search

Abstract? Time Related Association rule mining is a kind of sequence pattern mining for sequential databases. In this paper, a method of Generalized Association Rule Mining using Genetic Network Programming (GNP) with MBFP(Multi-Branch and Full-Pathes) processing mechanism has been introduced in order to find time related sequential rules more efficiently.

GNP represents solutions as directed graph structures, thus has compact structure and partially observable Markov decision process. GNP has been applied to generate time related can- didate association rules as a tool using the database consisting of a large number of time related attributes. The aim of this algorithm is to better handle association rule extraction from the databases in a variety of time-related applications, especially in the traffic volume prediction and its usage. The generalized algorithm which can find the important time related association rules has been proposed and experimental results are presented considering how to use the rules to predict the future traffic volume and also how to use the traffic prediction in the optimal search problem.



I. INTRODUCTION  Currently available vast amount of traffic data are recorded using various components of the intelligent transportation system(ITS) [1]. Satellite-based automatic vehicle location technologies such as Global Positioning System (GPS) or cellular phones can determine vehicle positions at frequent time intervals. These equipments collect information about the vehicle positions and speeds, which are archived in large amount of databases, enabling further analysis of the data about the traffic situations such as traffic volume patterns.

Searching for the pattern is a process for obtaining as- sociations where the occurrence of one event is related to other events. The association rule mining method, i.e., one of the most popular data mining methods with a wide range of applications is used in the proposed mechanism aiming at discovering association relations or correlations among attributes encoded within a database [2].

For example, ?If Section S on the traffic map has high traffic volume, then Section D also has high traffic volume.? is a typical relationship that we will obtain using the normal data mining methods, however, in dynamic systems with sequential datasets, we are more interested in the sequential association patterns such as ?If Section S on the traffic map has high traffic volume at time t, then Section D also has high traffic volume 10 time units later.?  In order to extract these sequential association patterns in the time-related databases and represent at what time the  Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University; Email: zhy836@toki.waseda.jp; mabu@aoni.waseda.jp; sen- nou@asagi.waseda.jp; k.shimada@aoni.waseda.jp; hirasawa@waseda.jp  event will happen or how long the event will persist, we have already proposed a method of time-related association rule mining [3] using Genetic Network Programming (GNP) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the rule extraction in time related databases. But, in this paper, we generalized the original time-related association rule mining in terms of Multi-Branch and Full-Pathes(MBFP), where there are a good number of branches in the judgement nodes and every possible combination of the Multiple branches are studied simultaneously.

The most famous model in the association rule mining is Apriori algorithm, in which Agrawal et al proposed the support-confidence framework [4]. However, Apriori algo- rithm may suffer from large computational complexity when extracting rules from dense databases. Many approaches have been proposed to extract association information in various directions, including efficient apriori-like mining methods [5], [6].

Genetic Algorithm(GA) [7],[8], proposed by J.H. Holland, has also been applied to data mining research in order to deal with dense databases. However, because a rule is represented as an individual or part of an individual of GA, it is hard for them to give us a complete picture of the underlying relationships in problem domains, thus it is not easy to extract enough number of association rules.

Unlike other methods mentioned above, the main task of GNP-based data mining is to allow the GNP individuals to self-evolve and extract association rules as many as possible.

What?s more, it uses evolved individuals(directed graphs of GNP) just as a tool to extract candidate association rules.

Thus, the structure of GNP individuals does not necessarily represent the association relations of the database. As a result, the structures of GNP individuals are less restricted than the structures of GA, and GNP-based data mining becomes capable of producing a large number of association rules.

The basic feature of the proposed mechanism is like the following: ? The GNP structure of rule representation is generalized  to multiple branches, and Multi-Branches and Full- Paths(MBFP) with Transition Route Memory(TRM) searching mechanisms are used to find all the potential combinations of the attributes using GNP, which can improve the efficiency of the proposed method.

? The database is time-related considering the real-time factor. Thus, the process of searching the data for cal- culating the confidence, support and chi-squared value     is two dimensional search.

? A simple classification mechanism is combined with the  rule extraction system, thus the time related rules can be used to predict the future traffic volume on the traffic networks.

? Another feature of the proposed method is that it can predict not only the traffic jam of a specific section on the road networks, but also can predict the low, middle and high traffic volume of all of the sections on the road network, which might be useful in future applications.

? Prediction result is used to help developing a more efficient optimal route search of Q-value based optimal route algorithm[9] studying a simple simulator.



II. GENERALIZED TIME RELATED ASSOCIATION RULE MINING USING GNP  The whole procedure of the proposed algorithm is like Fig.1. The first step is the time related class association rule extraction step based on the attribute set and its class type to extract the rules from the time related database. In the rule extraction procedure, two kinds of iterations are included, i.e., the outer iteration represents the class association rule mining, which means to extract the class rules for all the con- sequent attributes with Attribute Accumulation Algorithm[3], while the inner iteration represents the basic procedure of the time related data mining, which uses Generalized GNP individuals with MBFP-TRM to generate the candidate rules, then calculate the support, confidence and chi-squared values of the candidate rules based on the time related databases.

Basic steps of proposed algorithm  The second step is the classification stage in which the extracted rules are used to predict the future traffic using the degree of matching between data and antecedent part of the rules in each class, and the class with the highest degree of matching will be selected. The selected class is the classification result. If the classification result is the same as the actual traffic, then the prediction is correct, otherwise incorrect, and the accuracy of the prediction can be obtained in this way.

The final step is to combine the traffic prediction with the Q-value based optimal route algorithm, while the prediction result can give a more accurate future traffic estimation for the optimal route algorithm thus shorter traveling algorithm can be obtained by the proposed method.



III. GENETIC NETWORK PROGRAMMING(GNP)  In this section, Genetic Network Programming(GNP) is briefly reviewed [10],[11]. GNP is a sort of evolutionary optimization technique, which evolves arbitrary directed graph programs as solutions(individuals). Because of the strong expression ability of the directed graph structures, GNP can realize the partially observable Markov decision process.

The basic expression of GNP node is shown in Fig.2. This describes the gene of node i, then the set of these genes represents the genotype of GNP individuals. NTi describe the node type, NTi = 0 means node i is a start node, NTi = 1 represents node i is one of judgment nodes and NTi = 2 represents node i is one of the processing nodes. IDi is an identification number, for example, NTi = 1 and IDi = 1 means node i is J1(Judgment node with ID 1). Ci1, Ci2,..., denote the nodes connected from node i. di j is the transition time from node i to node Ci j.

Gene structure of GNP node  A. Structure of Database  The database is time series-based, i.e., the tuples in the time series database represent the time point instead of the transaction as shown in Table 1. TimeID in Table 1 represents the time point, it can be one second, one minute, one hour or even one episode and so on, thus, its concrete meaning is related to the concrete problem to solve. For example, attribute A1 and A2 correspond to the sections named A1 and A2 respectively on the road networks, and one time unit can represent half an hour during a day in the time related database, thus, each data represents how many vehicles there are for each section at every half an hour.

According to the range of the continuous values of sec- tion attribute Ai, we divide the continuous values to three    categories, i.e., Low,Middle and High. Supposing that the data is within the range of [0,10], and Middle threshold is 4 and High threshold is 7, then, section Ai = 5 is ranked as Ai ?Middle, i.e., the data of Ai is now M. The L, M and H represent the Low,Middle and High values respectively, as shown in Table 1.

TABLE I  DATABASE STRUCTURE  Time ID A1 A2 A3 0001 H M H 0002 M M M 0003 H L M 0004 L H L  Range: [0, 10]; Middle threshold=4; High threshold=7;  B. Time Related Class Association Rule  The following is a formal statement of the problem of mining association rules. Let A = {A1, A2, . . . , Ak} be a set of items or attributes, i.e., it can represent each section on the traffic networks in the traffic volume prediction problem.

Let G be the total number of time points in the time related traffic volume database. Each time point is associated with a unique identifier whose set is called TimeID. Let D={D1,D2, . . . ,Dk} be a set of time points of the event occurrence of the corresponding attribute, i.e., if the event of attribute Ai occurs at time point 3, then Di is denoted as Di = 3.

Definition 1: Time Related Attribute: The set of time re- lated attribute Ai is defined as At ={A1(D1), A2(D2), . . . , Ak(Dk)}, where Dk is the time point when the event of Ak occurs, Ak ? A and Dk ? D.

The continuous value of the time related database has been already discretized to three different levels: Low,Middle and High (briefly, L,M and H). In general, a set of items in At with its corresponding value level is called time transition.

The time transition is now defined as follows:  Definition 2: Time Transition: Time related attribute set At with its corresponding Low/Middle/High level is defined as time transition TT={A1(V1)(D1), A2(V2)(D2), . . . , Ak(Vk)(Dk)}, where Vk ? V = {Low,Middle,High}, Ak ? A and Dk ? D.

Definition 3: Sub Time Transition: Time transition S TT is called a sub time transition of time transition TT , if and only if its time transition constitutes a sub set starting from the first element of TT .

Let Ai(?)(t=p) be an attribute in a database at time p and its value is 1 or 0. Ai(?) represents Ai(Low)/Ai(Mid)/Ai(High).

The time related class association rule mining extracts the following association rules:  (Aj(?)(t = p) = 1) ? . . . ? (Ak(?)(t = q) = 1) ? (Ac(?)(t = r) = 1), where (Ac(?)(t = r) = 1) indicates the class consequent attribute.

Here, p ? q ? r, and the first t always equal 0 and other time points are the relative time shifts from the first attribute.

C. Generalized GNP Mining with MBFP-TRM  As a natural extension of the previously proposed method [3], [12], a route with n attributes(user-defined) starting from the processing node is used as the possible antecedent parts, and it is combined with the current consequent class in the Consequent Table(CT )[3] to generate the time transitions.

As shown in Fig. 3, there are three kinds of connections corresponding to Low/Middle/High in every judgement node of GNP individuals. This structure is called Generalized GNP, which can generate candidate rules more efficiently.

The conventional method also uses the generalized GNP for the traffic prediction, however, it is not efficient and does not utilize the potential reusability of the directed graph structure completely, thus more efficient method has been proposed here to obtain all the possible combinations of n judgment nodes starting from the processing node using MBFP method.

The conventional method is in fact Transition Route Searching mechanism(TRS) based method, which means first determines the route of transitions using Generalized GNP structure, then, carry out the searching according to the concrete data in the database using two-dimensional search[3]. Actually, TRS method just explores one possible time transition starting from the processing node, while there could have 3n?1 possible time transitions with the length of n.

Although MBFP attempts to record the counts for all the possible time transitions from one processing node[3], a problem emerges as shown in Fig.3, where there are two different time transitions from P1 to C(Low) such as ?=A(Low)0, C(Low)t1 and ?=A(High)0, D(Middle)t1 , C(Low)(t1+t3). They both go through the C(Low) connection, thus, the count of C(Low) in Fig.3 will be confused with each other due to different time transitions. Here, attributes are denoted by A, B, C and so on. The problem is which time transition this count corresponds to?

Simple memory structure to record the passed sub time transitions and their corresponding counts can solve the problem, however, at the expense of huge overlap checking during the searching. Therefore, a counting structure of Time Transition tree(TT tree) is proposed, which indicates all the possible time transitions starting from one processing node as a tree structure(Fig.3). The same C node in Generalized GNP structure now becomes located in different time transi- tions, hence the counts can be recorded correctly without remembering the history of the passing routes. Traveling through the tree to any of the nodes will automatically give the information of the passed routes, and also, the counts for different time transitions can be stored separately.

TT tree is just a temporary searching structure for rule extraction, and after all the counts are recorded, and impor- tance criteria are evaluated, it can be destroyed immediately.

Individuals are encoded using GNP structure, while GNP can generate a variety of different TT trees for different processing nodes.

In order to further improve MBFP algorithm, instead    B  A  D  C  C CE  E F  A  C A  A  t1 t3  t3  t2  t2  t1  t2  t1  t3  t1,t2,t3,...:Tim e D elay  C ount?

Generalized GNP with Time Transition Tree  of using the ?time transition ? database? thinking logic, a backwards structure is proposed like ?database ? time transition?.

This is a Transition Route Memory(TRM) mechanism, which means that the concrete transitions of the attributes in GNP are determined using the database. In other words, ?What is the value of the attribute?? type judgement nodes are used in MBFP-TRM.

For example, as shown in Fig.4, given a TT tree by GNP structure, first attribute A is checked at time point 0000, and since its value is M, the middle connection of TT tree is selected, the count a is increased by 1.0 and the next attribute becomes attribute B by GNP structure. Since the value of B at 0001 is L after 1 time delay, the Low connection is chosen, the count c increases by 1.0 and the next attribute becomes C at 2 time units later using GNP structure, likewise.

This is a typical example of building the tree transition based on the GNP structure and database, where its cor- responding counts are recorded for evaluating the rules by calculating support, confidence and the chi-squared value.

After building the time transitions starting from 0000, the time transition starting from 0001 will be checked in the same way. We should notice that time transition starting from 0001 is different from the time transition starting from 0000 because of the different attribute values of the database.

After building and checking all the time transitions starting from all the time points using the TT tree, if some of the time transitions in the TT tree do not appear in the database, then, their corresponding counts will be automatically zero.

When using TRS based MBFP mechanism only one time transition and its sub time transitions are checked during one turn of the database check, so if we use TRS based approach, 3n?1 turns of database searching is necessary for one processing node, where n is the user-defined time transition length.

When using TRM based MBFP mechanism, all of the possible combinations of the time transitions can be checked by only one database searching, which saves the calculation  time and the efficiency of the data mining is improved dramatically.

MBFP-TRM mechanism  After only one turn of the database searching, the counts for all the possible time transitions and all of their sub time transitions can be automatically obtained, as a result, the support, confidence and chi-squared value can be calculated for the candidate rules and sub candidate rules. If the criteria are higher than their thresholds, then, the time transitions becomes association rules and will be stored in a rule pool through the generations.

D. Fitness Function and Genetic Operators  The proposed method regards the rules containing many different attributes as important ones in addition to the conventional interest. Therefore, the fitness function of the GNP individual is defined by:  F = ? r?R {?2(r) + 10(nante(r) ? 1) + ?new(r) + ?mult(r)}.

The symbols are as follows: R : set of suffixes of important association rules which  satisfy the importance requirements of support, confidence and chi-squared value.

?2(r) : chi-squared value of rule r.

nante(r) : the number of attributes in the antecedent of  rule r.

?new(r) : constant defined by  ?new(r) =  { ?new, if rule r is new 0, otherwise  ?mult(r) : constant defined by  ?mult(r) =  ????????? ?mult, if rule r has many  different attributes 0, otherwise    ?2(r), nante(r), ?new(r) and ?mult(r) are concerned with the importance, complexity, novelty and diversity of rule r, respectively. In each generation, GNP individuals are replaced with the new ones by the selection policy and other genetic operations. We used four kinds of genetic operators, i.e., uniform crossover, mutation of functions, mutation of connections and mutation of time delays of judgement nodes, respectively.

E. Classification  Firstly, classify the extracted association rules in the pool into consequent attribute classes. Every attribute has three consequent attribute classes, i.e., attribute Ai is classified into the following consequent attributes, Ai(Low), Ai(Mid), Ai(High).

Then, the association rules in each class are used to study whether the testing data satisfies the antecedent items of the rules. The testing data are called satisfied if they satisfy the antecedent items of the rules.

The ratio of the number of satisfied rules to the total number of rules for every class is calculated considering confidence, and the testing data is classified into the class whose ratio is the highest.

The concrete process is like the following:  (1) Calculate Rk: Calculate the set Rk of the suffixes of the rules in class k, whose antecedent items satisfy the testing data.

(2) Calculate Creditk for every class:  Creditk = ? r?Rk  con f idencer, (1)  (3) Calculate S corek for every class:  S corek = Creditk Totalk  , (2)  where, Totalk is the total number of rules in class k, that is, the fixed number of N f in this paper.

(4) Compare the S corek and the class with the highest score becomes the winner for the testing data.



IV. SIMULATION  In this section, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are studied by a simple traffic simulation.

Unlike other methods in the traffic prediction of recent years, the proposed method not only aims at predicting the traffic jam on a specific section of the road networks, but also, it is interested in providing the whole traffic prediction for all of the sections on the road networks so that the navigation system can refer to this kind of information for the calculation of the Optimal Route.

In order to testify the effectiveness of the obtained rules, a simple traffic prediction method is combined with the Q- value based optimal route mechanism, and the effectiveness of the proposed method has been studied using the simple simulator.

A. Traffic Simulator  Each section between two intersections in the road net- works has two directions, and we assume each direction of the section represents different literals, i.e., items or attributes. The traffic simulator used in our simulations consists of the road model with 7 ? 7 roads like Fig.5, i.e., each section has the same length, all cars have the same speed for simplicity, and the shape of the total road is like a grid network. Time shift in road setting in Fig.5 represents the time delay of the traffic lights between neighboring intersections.

The attributes correspond to the judg- ment node functions, for example, the class of the attribute ??W4N6,W4N7(Low)? can be interpreted in such a way that the section named?W4N6,W4N7? has low traffic volume.

B. Optimal Route Algorithm  In order to use more realistic traffic data for generalized association rule mining, the Q-value based optimal routing algorithm is adopted[9]. Fig.6 shows the procedures on how the optimal route is calculated and updated by using the Q values.

The detailed steps are as follows: 1) Initialize the traveling time of all sections.

ti j = di j/?a, (13)    Initialize: tij=dij/ a  Q value Calculation: Foreach destination d,  recursively calculate Q d(i,j)of each pairofsections using tij.

O ptim alR oute: Find the optim alroute using Boltzm an D istribution  Update tij  N  C alculation ofTij(t): C alculate the average traveling tim e overall  sections.

Y  T>threshold  t=t+1  C alculate D ifference: T= [[Tij(t)-Tij(t-1)]  Fig. 6. Optimal route calculation with Q values  where, ti j: the the traveling time from intersection i to  intersection j, di j: distance from intersection i to intersection j, ?a: average speed of cars.

2) For each destination d, Q values of all of the intersection pairs can be obtained by iterating the following equation:  Qmd (i, j)?? ti j +mink?A( j) Qm?1d ( j, k), Qd(i, j) = limm?inf Qmd (i, j), where, A( j): set of suffixes of intersections directly  movable from intersection j, Qd(i, j): optimal traveling time to destination  d, when the car bound for destination d moves to intersection j at intersection i.

Qmd (i, j): Qd(i, j) in the m th iteration.

3) The following probability Pd(i, j) using Qd(i, j) is used to navigate the car bound for destination d.

Pd(i, j) = e?  Qd (i, j) ??  j?A(i) e? Qd (i, j) ?  , (16)  where, ?: temperature constant, ? =10 is used.

Pd(i, j): probability for the car bound for destination d to move to intersection j at intersection i as the next intersection.

4) Calculate the average traveling time difference ?T between the current time and one step previous time over all sections.

5) When exceeds the threshold ?T , revise ti j and go back  to step 2, else go back to step 4, ?T = 10000 is used in the simulation.

C. Efficiency for Rule Extraction  In this simulation, the number of rules stored in the rule pool is compared between the proposed Generalized GNP with Multi-Branches and Full-Paths(MBFP) and Conven- tional GNP. Each round has the same number of generations of 50 and the chosen set size for AAM is 100 [3], [12].

Fig.7 shows the total number of rules obtained in the rule pool versus round number [3], [12]. In the conventional method, GNP individuals have only the Yes-side connection, while Generalized GNP individuals have multi-branches like Fig.3. We can see from Fig.7 that the proposed MBFP method can extract important class association rules more efficiently, when compared with the conventional one.

A ve ra g e n u m b e r o f ru le s  e xt ra ct e d p e r R o u n d  Conventional m ethod Generalized GNP with M BFP  Fig. 8. Comparison of the average number of rules extracted per round.

Since all the possible time transitions are explored, a comparative high average number of rules can be obtained in MBFP algorithm. As a result, it is found from Fig.8 that the proposed MBFP method shows the high efficiency of the extraction, and a proper number of rules are obtained efficiently.

D. Self-decrease Criteria  Like the conventional method [3], [12], when there do not exist enough number of association rules satisfying the    current criteria, the thresholds for evaluating the importance of the rules are decreased based on the self-decrease rate in order to extract enough number of Nf rules for each class.

How to choose the proper self-decrease rate is very impor- tant, since it influences the testing accuracy as shown in Table

III. The accuracy is defined in the following: if the traffic prediction result of the section at time t is ?Low? and the real traffic of this section at time t is exactly ?Low?, then, the accuracy is 100%. The Low/Middle/High accuracy means the accuracy when the real traffic is Low/Middle/High, respectively.

TABLE III  AVERAGE PREDICTION ACCURACY FOR DIFFERENT SELF-DECREASE  RATE(TESTING)  self-decrease rate Prediction Accuracy Overall Low Middle High  0.95 85.01 65.76 88.44 84.01 0.90 82.26 64.98 85.31 80.81 0.85 81.72 60.19 82.26 71.83 0.80 80.97 59.70 82.01 70.41 0.75 80.67 58.02 73.92 73.68 0.70 76.04 54.75 83.39 67.93  It can be seen from Table III that the more the criteria for important association rules decreases, the lower the prediction accuracies become.

E. Optimal Route with Traffic Prediction  The next step is to use the prediction for the optimal route calculation in order to obtain better routes. For example, if the navigation system knows section A in the route will have a high traffic volume during the traveling, the navigation system can chose another optimal route to avoid being trapped in the heavy traffic.

Q values at the intersections of the current route are revised as follows when the car arrive at the intersection i at time t:  Qd(i, j) ? Qd(i, j) ? ?1, If Vi j(t + 1) = Low, Qd(i, j) ? Qd(i, j) + ?2, If Vi j(t + 1) = High,  where, Vi j(t+1) represents the traffic volume prediction from intersection i to intersection j at time t, ?1 and ?2 are the parameters for the reward and punishment by future traffic prediction, respectively, and ?1=?2= 5 are used.

In order to study the efficiency of the traffic volume prediction, the greedy method is applied to the vehicle after the above update of Q values, which means the vehicle will choose the route with the minimum Q-value.

Comparison is done between using updated Q values by traffic prediction and using Q values based on the current traffic.

Three ODs are considered for calculating the routes with or without prediction, which are shown in Fig.9.

As shown in the Table IV, Q-value based optimal route calculation with traffic prediction can reduce the traveling time of the optimal route since it considers the future traffic situations when choosing the next section on the optimal route.

V. CONCLUSION  In this paper, a generalized sequential association rule mining has been proposed using Generalized GNP with MBFP processing mechanism. It is clarified from simulations that the proposed method can extract important time-related association rules for each class of the consequent attributes efficiently. These rules are used to decide to which class the time-related data belong. From simulations, we have also found that the proposed method can be used in traffic pre- diction problems. And the obtained rules can provide useful information for the Q-value based optimal route calculation, thus, finally improve the effectiveness of the optimal route algorithm for the navigation system. Further improvements on how to combine the traffic volume prediction and optimal route algorithm more efficiently will be studied in the next step.
