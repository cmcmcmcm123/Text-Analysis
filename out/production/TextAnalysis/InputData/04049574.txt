Dickinson *  Department of Electrical  Engineering Princeton  University  Princeton,  New  Jersey 08544  S U M M A R Y  The  term  analog Computation  evokes  numerous  associations; the  planimeter,  the  slide  rule,  the  differential  analyzer,  and  other physical  computing  devices  are  modeled  by  mathematical  equa- tions  with  diverse  applications.  By  drawing  a  careful  distinction between  analog  and  digital  computation,  it  becomes  possible  to compare  the  use of analog  computation in the  solution of various optimization  problems  with  the  use of digital  computation.  The famous  open  question of complexity  theory  for  digital  computa- tion,  whether or not  P = NP,  owes its practical  importance to the ability of the  Turing  machine  model  for  digital  computation to provide a realistic,  ideal  model  for  a  digital  computer.  It  being widely  assumed  that P # NP, NP-complete  decision  problems are  widely  regarded as intractable.  (Here  we  remind  the  reader that   this  kind of complexity  analysis  deals  with  worst  case  analysis of infinite  families of combinatorial  optimization  problems,  and intractability  refers  to  asymptotic  rate of growth of computational requirements  for  larger  and  larger  problem  instances.  For  further reference,  see [GJ].)  Can  analog  computation  be  used to solve  intractable  com- binatorial  optimization  problems,  circumventing  the  apparent limi- ta t ions of digital  computation?  This  appears  to  be  unlikely, as argued in  a  recent  paper  [VSD].  Indeed,  it  appears  to  be  a  difficult task to arrange  for  an  analog  computation to solve  even  ?simpler? problems  such as those in  class P in the  asymptotic  l imit .   The main  thrust  of [VSD]  may  be  described as follows. If we change our viewpoint  and  adopt a thesis  that  every  analog  computation can  be  simulated in polynomial  time  with a Turing  machine,  then the  assumption  that  P # NP implies  certain  consequences  about the  behavior of analog  computers.  Following  [VSD],  we  call  the thesis  about  analog  computation  Strong  Church?s  Thesis  (SCT).

The  validity of S C T  is  subject  to  verification  using  various mathematical  models  for  analog  computation.  In  [VSD],  a  class of differential  equation  models  is  shown  to  satisfy  SCT.

Differential  equation  models  associated  with  NP-complete problems  have  been  proposed in the  literature.  These  provide  an opportunity  to  explore  and  develop  interesting  complexity issues related  to  systems  and  control.  Not  all of these  models  correspond to analog  computations as formalized in [VSD].  A  common shortcoming  is  the  failure of the  model to admit  a scaling  that constrains  the  solutions  to evolve  in a polynomially-bounded hypercube  in  ?configuration-space?,  for  a fixed level of precision of the  computation.  (I t  is an  assumption  about  analog  computa- tions  that  problem  variables  cannot  be  encoded  into  multidimen- sional  analog  quantities  whose  dimension  depends  on  the  numerical value, as in  representing  an  integer  with  a  variable-length  binary string).  Analog  sorting  schemes  provide  a  simple  illustration of this  inherent  obstacle to solution of ?numerical?  problems  by  ana- log  means.  The  differential  equation  models for ?nonnumerical? I  Work supported by the National Science Foundatlon  through  grant ECS84-05460  problems  can  also  suffer  from  this  drawback.  One  topic  to  be  dis- cussed  in  this  talk is the  ?neural  network?  formulation  proposed by  Hopfield  and T a n k  IHT] for  the  solution of the  NP-complete Traveling  Salesman  Problem  with  systems  described  by  differential equations.  The  scaling  problem in this  model  arises  from  the  use of a  sigmoid-type  nonlinear  amplifier  characteristic  with  large  gain.

We will  also  present a discussion of a  dynamic  system associ- ated  with  a  linear  programming  problem,  and  related to the NP- complete  problem  3-SAT,  Boolean  satisfiability of a  conjunction of three-term  disjunctions.  The  model  differs  from  the  static model  presented in [VSD].  Empirical  evidence  and  analysis  suggest some  connections  with  ergodic  theory  and  complex  dynamics (cham). Our results  support  the  conjecture  that  the  number of collisions  with  constraint  boundaries  grows  exponentially, as is predicted  by  the  basic  thesis of analog  computation  and  the assumption  that  P # NP. A  second  model,  based  on  a  time- optimal  control  problem,  will  also  be  illustrated.  The  basic  thesis of analog  computation  and  the  assumption  that P # NP combine to  imply  that  the  optimal  bang-bang  control  law  requires  an exponential  number of switches in the  worst  case.  The  validity of this  prediction will be  discussed.
