Abstract?In recent years, cities in China have achieved  unprecedented development. Up to 2011, there have been an  urban population of 691 million, and emerged several mega-city  regions, such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong - Shenzhen -  Guangzhou etc. For the significant, large-scale economy and  population cluster effect, mega-city regions have become  important engines for promoting economic growth and social  development. With the hyperactive urban construction,  overwhelming urban scale and rapid population growth, there  occurs more and more urban geological problems in land  utilization, resource supply, environmental protection, hazards  prevention and cure in many cities, which become big threats to  urban geological safety and constraints on the urban sustainable  development. For all cities are constructed on geological objects,  the support of Urban Geology is necessary for urban  development, and urban geological information has irreplaceable  basic role for rapid development of mega-city regions. There is  an increasing requirement for the intellectualized, integrated,  multi-dimensional and quick-response geological safety  supporting system for mega-city regions (GSSSMR) based on the  technologies of large spatial databases, GIS, virtual reality and  networks, etc., meeting the need of guaranteeing geological  resources and geological environment safety, and urban planning,  construction, management, mitigating and preventing disasters,  etc. After analyzing the requirements of geological information  and GSSSMR, we introduce the architecture of GSSSMR. At last,  based on the research in this paper, the development and  applications of GSSSMR in Beijing, China are presented.

I. INTRODUCTION  Cities in China have achieved an unprecedented development in recent years. Up to 2011, the urban population and urbanization rate have reached 691 million and 51.27%, respectively [1]. It is the first time that the urbanization broke through 50% line. And this has formed several mega-city regions with the population of 120 million such as Hong Kong ? Shenzhen ? Guangzhou region [2].

For the impacts of information technology, communication technology, and capital flows, there is more essential element and economic centralization in mega-city regions compared  with other small cities. And China has approved a development plan of 14 regions such as Pearl River Delta, Beibu Gulf, Hainan International Travel Island, etc. According to the predication of McKinsey Global Institute [3], urban population in China will reach 1 billion, and more than 221 cities will have a population of over a million by 2025.

Although mega-city regions have become important engines for promoting economic growth and social development with the significant large-scale economy and population cluster effect, there occur more and more geological problems in utilization of urban land, resource development, waste disposal, environment protection and natural disaster prevention.

The fact that cities are built on geological objects determines that urban development is closely connected with the basic support of Urban Geological Survey (UGS). Up to now, lots of cities in China have carried out UGS, and accumulated lots of data in basic geology, engineering geology, hydrogeology, geochemistry and geological disaster, etc.

However, the huge potential value of geological data has not been fully exploited. In this case, the quick response GSSSMR, taking advantage of the latest achievements of modern information technology such as huge spatial database, GIS, 3D visualization and internet, is extremely urgent for guaranteeing geological resources and geological environment safety and realizing sustainable development.



II. THE REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS OF GSSSMR FOR MEGA- CITY REGIONS  Mega-city regions are the new urban models emerged in the early 21st century. Specifically, Mega-city regions are comprised of a series of 20 to 50 cities, which are separated from themselves and connected with their function [4]. They gather around the one or more large central cities, and show great economic power by the new division of labor function.

Cites is the most active regions of economic activity. Urban geological data, as the important achievement of UGS, are the necessary basic information for urban planning, construction, management, mitigating and preventing disasters. They have the following characteristics:  Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41202238/40742015), China Postdoctoral Foundation (No. 20060400348).

? Multi-element. This characteristic can be divided into three subtypes. Multi-resources: Compared with other geological investigations, UGS may mostly have a higher degree of exploration and accumulate more geological data. These data include both original data, such as drill data, geophysical exploration data, geochemical exploration data, and interpreted data, such as cross-sections, geological maps. Multi-format: Considering the data storage formats, there are numeric data, maps, documents, pictures, images, etc.

in the modeling. Multi-type: 3DUGMS include spatial data, property data and textures etc. They are located aboveground or underground. Natural and man-made models are all included.

? Multi-thematic: The data in 3DUGM are collected from diverse thematic areas, such as bedrock, hydrogeology, engineering geology, geochemistry, geophysics, geological disasters, stratigraphy, etc. The independent and integrated representation and analysis of each thematic data are all needed.

? Multi-dimensional: The 2.5D DEM data, 3D geological structure models, 3D geological property models and even the 4D dynamic models, for example, dynamic representation of underground water level change, all occur here.

? Multi-scale: For different applications with different data accuracy, UGS is concerned with different scale data. For example, large scale models are necessary in the construction engineering, while small scale models may be enough in urban planning.

? Massive Data: For the storage of 3D information, data quantity here, often up to TB, is often more than that in 2D GIS. The ability of managing and operating massive data is needed.

? Complex data association: Complex data association is common in urban geological investigation data, for example, several samples or tests may be referred to one field investigation point.

The rapid development of the mega-city regions has led to more serious resources and environment problems with the following features compared to the small cities:  ? As construction projects become extremely active in mega-city regions, the forward-looking geological information are urgently required for set selection, construction, management of some major projects such as new regions, subways and intercity high- speed rail, etc.

? Some related issues in mega-city regions are more prominent. Firstly, the more dense population leads to more severe effect of the geological disasters and environmental pollution. As a result,  the additional geological work are required, such as the geological hazard risk assessment, dynamic monitoring and real-time forecasting and warning of land subsidence, active fault, landslide and groundwater, etc. The second is the solid waste disposal site section. For  example, domestic wastes in Beijing in 2009 have reached 6.69 million tons. The amount is so much that the landfill site has to be chosen carefully for the worry of water, soil, and air pollution. Thirdly, the evaluation of groundwater resources and the emergency water source selection should be strengthened. Lastly, as land resources are becoming scarcer, it will be inevitable of the exploitation and utilization of underground space in the mega-city regions.

? In mega-city regions, more effective and refining management is needed. And scientific and technological means, such as IT, will be utilized to achieve the quick response of the geological information services and sharing.

? For there are more qualified personnel in mega-city regions, public will have more requirements for the geological information sharing, such as the periodic bulletins of urban geological environmental quality.

? Urban geological data center, which is responsible for the collection, integration and management of the multi-element, heterogeneous and mass geological data, are required more urgently.

In summary, GSSSMR, an organic part of Digital City, aims to build an intellectualized, integrated, multi-dimensional and quick response urban geological safety supporting information system for satisfying urban planning, construction, management, mitigating and preventing disasters, etc. These features can be summarized as follows:  ? An efficient management platform for the gathering, searching, compiling and updating of multi-themes, multi-elements, heterogeneous and mass urban geological data.

? An intelligent, visualization and quick response decision platform for urban planning, construction, management, disaster prevention and reduction.

? A geological data publishing and sharing platform for the enterprises and public.

? A comprehensive research platform for professional geologists.



III. THE ARCHITECTURE OF GSSSMR  GSSSMR is to build a ?One Urban Geological Map? platform, in which all the diverse urban geological data can be displayed and analyzed in a unified virtual view regardless of their themes, data formats and storage positions, etc. And in this platform, urban geological data can be transformed into urban geological information, and then urban geological knowledge, and finally the great value for urban development.

The development of GSSSMR is a systematic engineering with the concern with hardware, software, talent, standards etc.

There are six main parts in the architecture of GSSSMR (Fig.

1).

? Support system: Support system includes the infrastructure of networks, hardware, support software    (Operating System, databases, GIS, anti-virus software), etc.

? Guarantee system: This system, the guarantee condition for the development and applications of GSSSMR, includes talent, coordinating department, system mechanism, standards, policies and rules, etc.

? Technology system: This refers to some key technologies in the development of GSSSMR, such as data integration, massive data management, 3D geological modeling, information security, distributed  technologies.

? Mega-city Geological Data Center. For the geological data in mega-city regions have wide range source, several types, large volume, and complex relationships, it is necessary to establish the special geological data center, for the collection, integration, sharing and deep development of the basic geographical data, field survey data and dynamic monitoring data, etc.

System Framework of GSSSMR    For there are many different applications and decision support subsystems in GSSSMR, it is necessary to extract the common functions in the various subsystems to build the basic support platform. And data management, geological thematic map production, 3D geological modeling and visualization, geological data processing and output, etc. are all included in this platform, based on the integration of the 2D GIS and 3D GIS.

? Mega-city geological safety application systems. The application systems provide fast intelligent decision support and sharing services functions based on the basic platform, professional evaluation model and 3D geological models. What?s more, for the wide applications, the application systems can be divided into several thematic subsystems, for example significant engineering project geological safety system. And comprehensive analysis system can be conducted based on these thematic subsystems. In addition, different sharing services are provided for enterprises, institutes and public with the concern of information access right.

The construction of GSSSMR is a huge systematic engineering, overall and step-by-step plans are all needed.

A. Mega-city Geological Data Center  Due to the geological complexity and multiplicity of the mega-city regions, the investigation content includes many subjects such as hydrogeology, engineering geology, geochemistry, geological disasters, stratigraphy, and geomorphology, etc. And the investigation methods include geology, drilling, geophysical exploration, geochemical exploration, remote sensing, test and computer, etc. In addition, the range of data includes ground, underground and aboveground. A special data center is needed for manage and analyze these complex big data, which is the data base for GSSSMR. What?s more, it is necessary to make standard and divide these data into basic geographic data, field investigation data, dynamic monitoring data, result data and metadata in order to manage them effectively.

Mega-city geological data have obvious thematic classification and subordinate relationships, and can be divided into spatial data and property data. Spatial data are used for describing the location, geometry and topologic relationships of geological objects and phenomena, while property data are used for describing the quality or character of geological objects and phenomena. For the long geological processes, geological objects and phenomena have complex shape and spatial relationships. Property data, important results from the tough filed investigation and laboratory tests, have the same significance with spatial data. Urban geological data are obviously different from geographic data for the complicated relationships between spatial data and the existence of massive property data. Integrated storage and management of spatial data and property data can be achieved by the object oriented method, in which the association relationships are established by defining the primary key fields [5, 6]. In addition, it?s better to develop a data access middleware between mega-city geological databases and software. This can provide users with  a transparent data access mode, in which they needn?t care about the data location, storage modes and data structures, etc.

3D geological models data also need to be stored into databases. However, at present, databases which support 3D spatial data, especially 3D geological model data, are quite limited, and specific data structure and data engine are needed to be developed [5, 6]. 3D spatial data organization and spatial index should also be fully considered [5, 6].

B. Mega-city Geological Safety Supporting Basic Platform  Mega-city geological safety supporting basic platform provides the basic software functions for GSSSMR. It includes the following modules.

? Data acquisition and collection: All the acquired and collected urban geological data can be classified, arranged and collected in digital way and standardized.

Data importation and transformation functions are also included in this module.

? Data storage and management: It provides a unified software environment for the editing, centralized management, and search for different kinds of data, such as, maps, tables, and documents. Timely, accurate and dynamic data updating is assured in this module.

? Thematic map compilation: Thematic maps, such as cross-sections, stratum histograms, isoline maps, statistical charts, can be created, edited and outputted conveniently.

? 3D modeling and analysis: This module provides quick construction, convenient editing and clear visualization of 3D urban geological models in a 3D scene. And the common spatial analyzing, assessing and assistant decision-making tools, such as model splitting from any position, directions and angles, excavation simulation, isoplane creating are all included.

? Information publishing: It provides a unified internet portal for the sharing and online web services of urban geological data and information.

? Platform maintenance: User management, authority management, operation monitoring and fault recovery, etc. are included in this module.

Mega-city geological safety supporting basic platform can be developed based on the integration of 2D GIS and 3D GIS, with the consideration of table processing, virtual reality, information security technologies etc. There are strong spatial correlations in mega-city geological data. GIS is suitable for organizing, managing and visualizing these massive, multi- thematic and dynamic data, and provides strong spatial analyzing functions with the saved topological relationships.

2D GIS widely applied in many fields has relatively strong versatility, while 3D GIS is not so common and is independently used in different fields for the complicated 3D data models, building methods and analysis. Therefore, the integration of 2D GIS and 3D GIS is one available choice in the development of urban geological information management    and service basic platform. In addition, to conform to the habits of geologists, graphical guide interface will be used when the related data and system functions are accessed.

C. Mega-city Geological Safety Supporting Application Systems  The application systems, which include professional analysis and assessment models, 3D geological models and application subsystems, are based on the basic platform. It is also a software system that can provide information sharing and decision-making assistance for governments.

1) Professional analysis and assessment models One important objective of GSSSMR is to provide  geological evidence for assessing the urban comprehensive bearing capacity of resources and environment. This can be achieved by analyzing and mining the investigation data and their characteristics, creating the assessment factors system, choosing quantitative or semi-quantitative assessment methods, and assessing the geological resources safeguard and geological environment quality with cutting-edge technologies and systematic knowledge.

These analysis? and assessment models include the models for geological hazard risk assessment, underground space development and utilization, groundwater environmental quality assessment, surface water environmental quality assessment, soil environmental quality assessment, land suitability evaluation, geothermal resource assessment, and the comprehensive assessment of mega-city geological environment and urban ecological environment, etc. At the same time, the dynamic monitoring models of groundwater, land subsidence, active fault and landslide, etc. should also be included for the mega-city resource and environment safety assessment and warming.

All these models could be effectively stored and managed by creating a mega-city geological analysis and assessment model database, in which the modes can be conveniently modified and updated. Furthermore, third-party assessment software interfaces should also be provided in the system for the better opening.

2) 3D mega-city geological models 3D mega-city geological models, including 3D geological  structure models, 3D geological property models, 3D underground buildings and structures, DOM (Digital Orthophoto Map) and DEM (Digital Elevation Model), etc., are used for describing the terrain, underground geological stratum and structures, human engineering activities in urban areas.

These models can give a clear and integrated 3D display of aboveground and underground natural and man-made objects, and reduce the blindness in geological cognition and the risk in mega-city planning, design and construction.

One of the important features and complexities of GSSSMR is to build links with mega-city 3D geological models such as 3D structural model of bedrock geology, Quaternary Geology, the 3D structure of the model, the engineering geological 3D structural model, 3D attribute model of engineering geology, hydrogeology 3D structural model, hydrogeological 3D attribute model. The further 3D visualization, spatial analysis and application needs to create a  suitable geological model with appropriate precise. In addition, due to the complexity of the relationship of geometry and topology, uncertainty, and information incompleteness and complex processing algorithms features of geological data, 3D mega-city geological models is a bottleneck for the development and applications of the system [7-10]. During the construction of urban 3D geological model, researchers have to focus on multi-element data, multi-method integration and automatic-semi-automatic modeling, etc [11].

3) Multi-thematic application subsystems Based on the needs of mega-city geology safety, the related  application subsystems is to be created, such as the subsystems for dynamic monitoring of geological hazards, major engineering geological safety assessment, underground space development and utilization, and comprehensive analysis of mega-city geology safety, etc. And the related application subsystems should be firstly constructed for solving the urgent problems facing in mega-city regions.

D. Beijing Geological Safety Supporting System (Bgsss)  As the rapid increase of the population (more than 20 million now) and accumulation of varies functions in Beijing, there are many geological problems, such as groundwater resources shortage, land subsidence, dynamic faults, and groundwater pollution etc. The safety of geological resources and geological environment has increasingly become the bottleneck for the sustainable development of Beijing.

Based on the shortage of energy and strategic resources and the active, hidden, unexpected and non-normal natural disasters, Beijing Geology and Mineral Exploration and Development Department provided the ?two-engineering and one-system plan? in the Beijing "Eleventh Five-Year" geological exploration and development plan. In other words, they include the protection engineering of important strategic resources (land, groundwater, shallow geothermal energy and underground space resources), the urban geology security engineering, and BGSSS. And BGSSS is the core of Beijing Digital Urban Geology.

Based on the Beijing 3D Geological Survey Project, the first stage project of BGSSS has achieved the construction of basic platform, including the functions of massive and multi- element geological data collection and management, thematic map compilation, 3D geological modeling and visualization, information publishing, and platform maintenance, etc. As with the professional analysis and assessment model, the monitoring of land subsidence, groundwater and shallow hypothermia, as well as groundwater flow model and simulation, have been initially achieved. There are 55,003 field investigation points, 25,000 drill data and 200 thematic result maps in the constructed Beijing comprehensive geological database.

Furthermore, 3D geological models of the bedrock strata, the Cenozoic strata and engineering construction layer in Beijing have been built based on the idea of "point - line - surface - solid", with a clear display of spatial structure and association relationships of different geological objects. An information hall with hundreds of square meters, equipped with 3D visualization devices, was also put into use. The application of the system is shown in Fig. 2. And this system is the first    one finished in the six pilot cities, and has also won the ?Silver National Prize for Excellent GIS Projects in 2008?, awarded by China Association for Geographic Information System.

In the first stage, the integrated mode of C/S and B/S was applied. Oracle was selected as the basic database. MapGIS was selected as the basic 2D GIS platform. GSIS developed by the Peking University research group was the basic 3D GIS platform. Communication between the 2D and 3D system was also implemented.

In the second stage, the deep collection and integration of geological information resources in the institute of Beijing Geological Data Center with good updating mechanism will get to work. An integrated analysis subsystem of groundwater environment and land subsidence will be formed based on the groundwater environment monitoring net and the land subsidence monitoring net. The multi-disciplinary, cross- system and comprehensive analysis and decision-making assistance of urban geology will also be achieved. This phase of the project is going on smoothly.



IV. CONCLUSIONS  Along with the increasingly rapid pace of urbanization in China, there occurs some mega-city regions with the cluster of talent, capital, technology and information. It becomes increasingly urgent for the intellectualized, integrated, multi- dimensional and quick-response mega-city geological safety supporting system in order to guarantee the geological resources and geological environment safety and sustainable development. However, it may be some difficult to develop such a system for that it involves several professional fields with complexity, high technical content, and a wide range of services. Based on the geological data and application characteristics, this paper analyzed the requirements of  geological safety supporting system for mega-city regions, then designed the architecture of the system and carried out the construction of Beijing geological safety supporting system.

This study can be helpful for other mega-city regions for different mega-cities may have many common needs for the system construction. In addition, this study may also be referenced for the system construction in the other scale cities.
