Mining Association Rules: A Continuous Incremental Updating Technique

Abstract A continuous incremental updating technique is proposed for efficient maintenance of the mining association rules when new transaction data are added to a transaction database. FP-growth algorithm can mine the complete set of frequent patterns by pattern fragment growth. To efficient maintenance of the mining association rules, we improve the FP-growth algorithm in three aspects: 1) an optimization technique for reducing the database size during the update process is discussed, and 2) the construction algorithm of a transaction tree T-tree, and 3) the candidate pattern pools are proposed based-on the structure of T-tree. Then, a continuous incremental updating algorithm, or CIU algorithm for short, is proposed. Our performance study shows that the continuous incremental updating technique is efficient and scalable for mining both long and short frequent patterns.

I. INTRODUCTION  One major application domain of data mining is in the analysis of transactional data. It is assumed that the database system keeps information about user transactions, where each transaction is a collection of data items. In this setting, association rules capture inter-relationships between various data items. In many situations, data mining is treated as a synonym of knowledge discovery in databases [4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 14]  Discovering association rules from a large amount of data sets has been a focused field in recent data mining research. Mining association rules from databases has the characteristics: 1) the size of the database is significantly large. 2) the rules mined is valid only in statistical terms. 3) the rules mined from a large database only reflect the current state of the database.

The characteristics indicate that the promise of data mining lies in the techniques to handle a large amount of data, to manage a substantial number of rules, and to maintain the rules over a significantly long period of time.

Hence, two problems are essential in order to make data mining a feasible technology. The two problems are: 1) design efficient algorithms for mining different types of  rules or patterns, and 2) design efficient algorithms to update, maintain, and manage the rules mined [5].

The first problem has been studied substantially with many interesting and efficient data mining algorithms reported [1, 2, 3, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20]. However, very little work has been done on the second problem.

FUP algorithm, an incremental updating technique for maintenance of mining association rules in large databases, is proposed [5]. However, the FUP algorithm is based on Apriori algorithm. Although Apriori algorithm is a successful algorithm, it may suffer from the two nontrivial costs: 1) it may need to generate a huge number of candidate sets; and 2) it may need to repeatedly scan the database.

To avoid generating a huge set of candidates, an efficient FP-tree-based mining method called FP-growth is developed [11]. The FP-growth algorithm can mine the complete set of frequent patterns by pattern fragment growth. However, we think that FP-growth algorithm may still suffer from the nontrivial costs: it is costly that the frequent items are sorted in their frequency descending order. There are following three reasons.

First, it is nontrivial cost that the frequent items are sorted in their frequency descending order. In the FP-growth algorithm, it is believed that the FP-tree tree nodes are arranged in their frequency descending order will have better chances of sharing nodes than less frequently occurring ones and the FP-tree structure is usually highly compact.

Second, sometimes it is impossible that the frequent items are sorted in their frequency descending order. In the FP-growth algorithm, the items in the transaction database have no their amount. However, if item amount is considered, it may be impossible that the frequent items are sorted in their frequency descending order.

Last issue is how to incrementally update an FP-tree.

Because the structure of FP-tree is dependent on the frequency descending order, the structure of FP-tree must be reconstructed when the frequency descending order changes due to the adding of new transactions.

In this paper, we study the problem of continuous incremental updating technique for maintenance of mined association rules. First, we construct a transaction tree, or T-tree for short. The T-tree structure is not dependent to the frequency descending order but is only dependent to   DOI 10.1109/WISM.2010.39    DOI 10.1109/WISM.2010.39     the order of serial number. Second, transactions in the primitive transaction database can be sequence amalgamated in certain regulations. Third, the concept of candidate pattern pool is proposed.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Section 2 gives a brief review of the problem of mining association rules and FP-growth algorithm. Section 3 gives the description of continuous incremental updating algorithm. The optimization technique is also discussed in this section. Section 4 gives our performance study.

Section 5 summarizes our study.



II. OVERVIEW OF FP-GROWTH ALGORITHM  We now present the basic concept about association rules and FP-growth algorithm [10, 11, 14].

A. Association Rules  Let I = {i1, i2, ?, im  An association rule is an implication of the form X Y, where X I, Y I, and X Y= . The rule X Y holds in the transaction set D with confidence c if c% of transactions in D that contain X also contain Y. The rule X  Y has support s in the transaction set D if s% of transactions in D contain X Y.

} be a set of literals called items.

Let D be a transaction database or a set of transactions, where each transaction T is an itemset such that T I. We can say that a transaction T contains X, a set of some items in I, if X T.

Given a set of transaction D, the problem of mining association rules is to generate all association rules that have certain user-specified minimum support, called min_sup, and minimum confidence, called min_conf.

The problem of mining association rules can be decomposed into two subproblems [1]: 1) Find all sets of items; and 2) Use the frequent itemsets to generate the desired association rules.

B. FP-growth Algorithm  The main idea of FP-growth is mining frequent itemsets. The notation in FP-growth is given TABLE I.

III. CONTINUOUS INCREMENTAL UPDATING ALGORITHM  In this section, we first propose an optimization technique for reducing the database size. Second, we give the definition and algorithm of transactions tree, or T-tree for short. Third, it is detail described that how to maintain the candidate pattern pools. Last, we give the continuous incremental updating algorithm.

A. Transaction Sequence Amalgamated Algorithm  Transaction Sequence Amalgamated algorithm, or TSA algorithm for short, is an optimization technique for reducing the database size. Some important properties given as follows are used in TSA algorithm.

Definition 1: Item amount in a transaction is the count of presence of the same item in the transaction, and item quantity in a transaction is the count of all different items in the transaction.

Algorithm: FP-growth.

Input: Database, D ; minimum support threshold, min_sup.

Output: Set of frequent patterns.

Constructing phase of FP-tree (1) scan D; (2) collect F and sort F as L; (3) create the root of a FP-tree and label as null; (4) for each T D, do{ (5) [p|P] = select and sort T according to the order in L; (6) insert_tree ([p|P], T) (7) next T;} (8) return FP-tree procedure insert_tree (P, N) (1) if T has a child N such that N.item-name = p.item.name then N++ (2) else {create a new node N, and N.count = 1; (3) N.parent = T; (4) N.node-link = nodes with same item-name via node-link structure; (5) if P then insert_tree (P, N) (6) else return;} Mining phase of a FP-tree Procedure FP-growth (Tree, ) (1) if Tree contains a single path P then (2) for each combination generate pattern support = min_sup of nodes (3) else for each a1, do { (4) generate pattern =ai with support = ai.support; (5) construct conditional pattern base and conditional FP-tree Tree ; (6) if Tree then FP-growth (Tree , );}     Definition 2: Item amount constraint specifies that mining association rules is performed under the guidance of item amount provided in transaction database.

Definition 3: Transaction without item amount constraint is the transaction in which there is only item but no item amount.

Definition 4: Transaction with item amount constraint is the transaction in which there is not only item but also item amount.

Hypothesis: In a transaction, every item may have its amount. An item amount may be same to some items amount, but different with other items amount.

Definition 5: If a transaction database D1 is transformed into another transaction database D2 but their association relationship or frequent itemsets are consistence, the procedure of transformation is called equivalent transformation of transaction database, and the two databases are the equivalent database, denoted as D1  D2 Definition 6: The item and its amount in a transaction  can be denoted ItemID:Amount. That is said, in a transaction database, the i  .

th item of the TIDth transaction and its amount can be denoted Ii,TID:Ai,TID, where Ii,TID is the ith item of the TIDth transaction, and Ai,TID is the amount of the ith item in the TIDth  Definition 7: In a transaction database D, given two transactions, T1 D and T2 D. There are n items in transaction T1 and denoted T1 = {I  transaction, TID is the abbreviation of the transaction identifier.

1,T1:A1,T1, I2,T1:A2,T1, ?, In,T1:An,T1}, and there are m(m n) items in transaction T2 and denoted T2= {I1,T2:A1,T2, I2,T2:A2,T2, ?, Im,T2:Am,T2}. If all the items in transaction T2 must exist in transaction T1, that is said, if I {I1,T2, I2,T2, ?, Im,T2 }, then must I {I1 T1, I2,T1, ?, In,T1  Definition 8: In a transaction database D, given two transactions, T1 D and T2 D. There are n items in transaction T1 and denoted T1 = {I  }, called T2 T1, or T1 T2.

1,T1:A1,T1, I2,T1:A2,T1, ?, In,T1:An,T1}, and there are m(m<n) items in transaction T2 and denoted T2= {I1,T2:A1,T2, I2,T2:A2,T2, ?, Im,T2:Am,T2}.

In transaction T2, the items are sorted in descending amount. That is said, A1,T2 A2,T2 ? Am,T2, in T2. In transaction T1, the items are sorted according to descending amount, A1,T1 A2,T1 ? Am,T1 ? An,T1.

If the first m items in transaction T1 are the corresponding items in transaction T2, that is said, Ii,T1=Ii,T2  Definition 9: In a transaction database D, given two transactions, T1 D and T2 D. There are n items in transaction T1 and denoted T1 = {I  , i=1, 2, ?, m, we can say T1>T2.

1,T1:A1,T1, I2,T1:A2,T1, ?, In,T1:An,T1}, and there are n items in transaction T2 and denoted T2= {I1,T2:A1,T2, I2,T2:A2,T2, ?, Im,T2:Am,T2}. If Ii,T1=Ii,T2, Ai,T1=Ai,T2  Definition 10: In a transaction database D, given two transactions, T1 D and T2 D. There are n items in transaction T1 and denoted T1 = {I  , i=1, 2, ?, n, we can say T1=T2.

1,T1:A1,T1, I2,T1:A2,T1, ?, Im,T1:Am,T1, Im+1,T1:Am+1,T1, ?, In,T1:An,T1}, and there are m(m n) items in transaction T2 and denoted T2= {I1,T2:A1,T2, I2,T2:A2,T2, ?, Im,T2:Am,T2}. All the items are  sorted according to descending amount in these two transactions. If the first m items in transaction T1 are same to the items in transaction T2 respectively, that is said, I1,T1 =I1,T2, I2,T1 =I2,T2, ?, Im,T1 =Im,T2, the transaction T2 can be amalgamated into transaction T1, denoted T1?=T1+T2. The new transaction T1? = {I1,T1:A1,T1?, I2,T1:A2,T1?, ?, Im,T1:Am,T1?, Im+1,T1:Am+1,T1, ?, In,T1:An,T1}, where A1,T1? = A1,T1 + A1,T2, A2,T1? = A2,T1 + A2,T2, ?, Am,T1? = Am,T1 + Am,T2  Theorem 1: T1 D and T2 D, if T1 T2, T1 T2, then T1? = T1+T2. If T1? D?, then D D?. The theorem is also called amalgamated theorem.

.

According to Theorem 1, we can amalgamate the transactions in primitive transaction database so as to reduce the quantity of transactions in primitive transaction database. An algorithm called Transaction Sequence Amalgamated algorithm, or TSA algorithm for short, is proposed to reduce the quantity of transactions in primitive transaction database and is shown in Figure 2.

In TSA algorithm, TSAD is the abbreviation of Transaction Sequence Amalgamated Database and stands for the amalgamated transaction database. The main idea of TSA algorithm is that sorting the transactions in the transaction database according to the quantity of items in every transaction in descending order, and amalgamating these transactions in the sequence.

Figure 2   The pseudo code of TSA algorithm  B. Definition and Algorithm of Transaction Tree  Definition 11: A transaction tree, or T-tree for short, is a tree structure defined below.

1) It consists of one root labeled as ?null?, a set of item prefix subtrees as the children of the root, and a frequent item header table.

2) Each node in the item prefix subtree consists of three fields: item name, count, and node link, where item name registers which item this node presents, count registers the number of items in transactions represented by the portion of the path reaching this node, and node link links to the next node in the T-tree carrying the same item name, or null if there is none.

Algorithm: TSA.

Input: transaction database, D.

Output: sequence amalgamated database, TSAD.

Method: (1) scan D; (2) sort transactions according toquantity of items in (3) TSAD1 = T1; (4) for ( k=2; k n; k++ ) { (5) for each transaction t TSADk-1 { (6) if ( t Tk and t Tk ) then t = t+Tk (7) else TSADk = { TSADk-1, Tk }}}; (8) sort items according to descending amount in transaction (9) return TSAD = TSADn     3) Each entry in the frequent item header table consists of two fields, item name and head of node link, which points to the first node in the T-tree carrying the item name.

The algorithm of constructing of transaction tree is shown in Figure 3. Note that, the difference between T-tree constructing algorithm and FP-tree constructing algorithm is the order.

Figure 3  The pseudo code of T-tree constructing algorithm  C. Candidate Pattern Pools  Candidate pattern pools include all of the candidate itemsets. Candidate pattern pools consist of two types of pools. One is the winner pattern pool, and another is the loser pattern pool. The definitions about the pattern pools are given as follows.

Definition 12: Candidate pattern pool is the set of the candidate itemsets.

Definition 13: Winner pattern pool is the set of frequent itemsets.

Definition 14: Loser pattern pool is the set of non-frequent itemsets.

D.Continuous incremental updating algorithm  Let WP be the set of frequent itemsets in the winner pattern pool, LP is the set of non-frequent itemsets in the loser pattern pool, s be the minimum support, OD be the number of transactions in the old ODB, d be the number of transactions in an increment db, and ND be the number of transactions in the new NDB, where NDB=ODB db, ND=OD+d.

An itemset I is the member of the winner pattern pool in the ODB database if I.support s OD, and an itemset I is the member of the winner pattern pool in the NDB database if I.support s ND.

Lemma 1: An itemsets I which is the member of winner pattern pool in the ODB is a loser in the NDB if and only if I.supportNDB<s ND.

Lemma 2: An itemsets I which is the member of winner pattern pool in the ODB is still a winner in the NDB if I.supportdb s d.

Lemma 3: An itemsets I which is the member of loser pattern pool in the ODB is a winner in the NDB only if I.supportdb s d.

Lemma 4: An itemsets I which is the member of loser pattern pool in the ODB is still a loser in the NDB if and only if I.supportdb<s d.

The Continuous Incremental Updating algorithm, CIU algorithm for short, is described in Figure 4.

IV. PERFORMANCE STUDY  In this section, we present a performance comparison of CIU algorithm and FP-growth algorithm.

The data sets that we used for our experiments are generated randomly. Figure 5 shows the results of test of run time. In our experiments, there are 50K transactions in primitive database. The run time shown in the figure is the incremental run time. The figure shows that the incremental run time can be reduced down by about one-half in the CIU algorithm, and the gap grows wider when the number of incremental transactions grows up.
