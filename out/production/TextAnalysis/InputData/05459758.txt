DMCMS: A Data Mining Based Course Management System

Abstract?In this paper, a course management system has been designed on the basis of data mining methods such as association rules, classification and clustering. This system aims at analyzing the hidden relationship between the students? academic grades and various data of students? performance in class, and the findings can be used as guidance for better teaching and learning in the future.

I. INTRODUCTION With the rapid development of information processing  technology, all the course management systems in universities are constantly improving. Therefore, a large amount of historical data about classes and students? academic performance has been collected, but these data has not been taken advantage of to do more in-depth analysis for useful information for teaching, and it?s certainly a waste of teaching resources. In this situation, we proposed a data mining based course management system (DMCMS) to log the course data generated during every class. In this system, association rules, decision trees and clustering are integrated to do a comprehensive mining for the hidden relationships between the students? academic grades and these course data. Our aim is to make full use of course data for valuable information to improve the teaching/learning quality.



II. RELATED WORK During the last several years, data mining techniques have  been used by many researchers to evaluate and enhance the higher education tasks. J. F. Superby [1] took various factors, including the personal background of each student, the performance of each student in his studies and each student?s perceptions into account, adopted discriminate analysis, neural networks, random forests and decision trees to classify students into three groups and then predict those students' academic success. P. Varapron [2] has used rough set theory as a classification approach to analyze student data where the Rosetta toolkit was used to evaluate the student data to describe different dependencies between the attributes and the student status. K. Mierle [3] described the results of analyzing data from a large collection of the so-called concurrent version system (CVS). The proposed model is used to extract all information of student performance in writing the code of assignments and to find some statistical patterns or predicators that can be used to enhance students? performance in writing the code.

Similarly, in web-based educational system, Minaei [4] used classification techniques to analyze features extracted from log data and marks in the final exam and predict students? performance fairly accurately. A. Merceron [5] used association rules algorithms to find out that mistakes were often related to each other when students? mistakes were noted down. The purpose is for the teacher to ponder and to review the course material or emphasize subtleties while explaining concepts to students.



III. SYSTEM FUNCTIONS  A. Basic Idea Data mining based course management system (DMCMS)  is mainly divided into two modules:  Basic information management is designed to collect course data generated in teaching and students? performance data. Simple statistic methods are also realized in this module.

Data mining module used data mining methods such as association rules, decision trees and clustering to do a comprehensive analysis for the hidden relationships between students? academic grades and course data.

Fig. 1 shows the functional structure of DMCMS.

Figure 1. Functional structure of DMCMS  2010 Second International Workshop on Education Technology and Computer Science  DOI 10.1109/ETCS.2010.392     B. Data Source There are two types of data in the system, daily data and  exam data. Daily data is generated in each class, including the contents of each class, the approaches adopted by teachers, the students? learning effect, the attendance and seat choosing information of students. While the exam data is obtained after middle and final examination, including the mark of each classroom content occupied in test, the exam mark, usual-time mark and the final mark. The data used in our experiment is collected from 117 students in Information Management Department in a university during their learning of the course Decision Analysis.



IV. BASIC INFORMATION MANAGEMENT  A. User Management User management is designed to add, delete and modify  user information, and the administrator sets permissions for users, and only the users with permissions can access different interfaces. Fig. 2 shows the main interface for administrator after login.

Figure 2. Main Interface of DMCMS  B. Class Management Teacher class management is designed for teachers to fill in  the basic information of each class. Fig. 3 shows the interface of teacher class management. Seat management is designed to set the basic information of classrooms and seats. Student class management is designed for students to fill in the activity data about students in each class.

Figure 3. Interface of teacher class management  C. Test Management This section is designed for teachers to fill in the mark of  each class content occupied in test according to the analysis of the tests (including middle and final exams), in addition, the final mark is also input into database in this system.

D. Information Search Information search is designed for users to search various  class data and students? mark from database. Fig. 4 shows the result of score information search.

Figure 4. Information Search interface in DMCMS  E. Statistic Management Basic statistics are mainly designed to do statistic analysis for exam data, which shows the highest mark, the lowest mark and the average mark of a class in the examination. For example, the basic statistic result of class 06090302 in their Decision Analysis examination is shown in Fig. 5.

Figure 5. Basic Statistic results  Bar Chart is used to show the number of students at different levels in examination. The experiment result is shown in Fig. 6.

Figure 6. Bar Chart in DMCMS     Pie Chart is used to show the score proportion of each class content in examination. The result of experiment is shown in Fig. 7.

Figure 7. Pie Chart in DMCMS  Fig. 7 says, among all the class contents, Overview and Solving of Utility Function have played important roles in examination, so these two contents should be priority in usual learning and review before examination.



V. DATA MINING This module is designed to analyze the data collected in the  system by data mining methods [6, 7]. Association rules, decision trees and clustering analysis are applied in this system.

A. Association Rules We implemented association rules by Apriori algorithm.

First, the data has been discredited, master(i) stands for the students? learning effect in classroom i, the value of this attribute are {1,2,3,4,5}, and test(i) stands for the mark of question i in final examination, the value of this attribute are {A,B,C,D}, and score(i) stands for the final mark of students, the value of this attribute are {A,B,C,D}. Fig. 8 shows the result of association rules.

Figure 8. Apriori Result in DMCMS  In Fig. 8, the 4th association rule suggests that students whose learning effect in the first class is 5 and in the third class is 3 will get B in the 6th question in final examination.

According to this rule, students should stress the importance of  the contents in the first and the third classes.

B. Decision Tree From decision tree it is easy to generate rules in the form IF  condition THEN outcome. In this system, decision tree is used to find the important factors which influence students? academic grades. The result is designed to be displayed in a visible way, which will be more convenient for users to find the rules. The experiment result is shown in Fig. 9.

Figure 9. Decision Tree Results in DMCMS  According to Fig. 9, the students whose attendance is high or mild will get a grade as B with the probability of 55.072%.

Thus we can draw a conclusion that the student should not be absent from classes.

C. Clustering Clustering is to find data points that naturally group  together, and splitting the full data set into a set of clusters.

The partition-based K-means algorithm is applied in this system.

There are 22 attributes in the dataset, they are score attribute, 8 attendance attributes with value {0,1,2}, and the last 13 attributes stand for the students? learning effect in 13 classes, the value of these attributes are {1,2,3,4,5}. Fig. 10 shows the clustering result.

Figure 10. K-means Result in DMCMS     We can draw a conclusion that the average grade in Cluster0 is obviously lower than Cluster1, the attendance in Cluster0 is very low, which means the students with poor grades should not be absent from classes.



VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, DMCMS: a data mining based course  management system has been developed, and applied in many university courses and achieved satisfactory results. This research provided a certain guidance to teachers? teaching and students? learning in the future. However, the system is still not so perfect, and needs further improvements. Firstly, a systematic deviation existed in the mining results, which may be causes by the self complexity of education objects, or the volume of data is not large enough. Secondly, the algorithms applied in the system remain to be further optimized, and lastly, more data mining techniques should be applied in the system.
