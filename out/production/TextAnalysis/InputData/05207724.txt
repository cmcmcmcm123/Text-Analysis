I.  INTRODUCTION With the rapid development of database and internet, the  database is becoming very large, multi-dimensional and distributed. The volume of data in distributed database is growing faster than the speedup in processing times. And data mining is one of effective means to solve these problems, in which association rules mining is a hotspot. At present, the frequent pattern is still the main task of mining association rules in distributed database, and the algorithms have FDM [1], DDDM [2], FDMA [3] and so on. In FDMA, obtain global-frequent itemsets based on transferring those bounded sub-trees, although it can reduce amount of communication overhead compared with the FDM and DDDM, pretreatment still isn't used in local sites, so the efficiency of processing data is still lower. In our study, a sampling algorithm, SMA, is proposed.

A. Association rules mining Association rules identify relationships among sets of  items and can be used to evaluate business trends, identify purchasing patterns, and classify customer groups. In brief, an association rule is an expression: YX ? ,where X and Y are itemsets and ?YX =? . Two measures is support and confidence. And the support of the rule is the probability that X and Y hold together among all the possible presented cases. And the confidence is defined as the percentage of transaction containing Y in addition to X with regard to overall number of transactions containing X.

The problem of discovering all association rules can be decomposed into two subproblems [4]:  ? Find all frequent sets of items that have transaction support above minimum support.

? Use the frequent itemsets to generate the desired rules.

In distributed database, there are some correlation between Local frequent itemsets and global frequent ones such as:  ? A global frequent item set is not sure to be a local frequent item set;  ? Each global frequent item set is at least a local frequent item set in one site.

If we obtain the global frequent itemsets by finding local frequent itemsets in each local database, it will be need for expensive I/O operation cost and the cost of communications. But it is inconceivable that we mine global frequent itemsets directly in the whole large database which is formed by all data in every website. So the size of the data sets will be affected to the execution efficiency of association rule mining algorithm. This paper introduces a new sampling technique, which would be used to process the data in every website. Then a whole sampling database would be generated, in which we can find the global frequent itemsets directly. Therefore, the speed of process the data in distributed database will be accelerated.

B. Sampling thinking The Despite a complete data set is very important for  getting reliable conclusions, but this is not entirely necessary.

The reason as follows:  ? There is more data redundancy in complete data set than in the sample data sets;  ? There is relatively expensive I/O operation cost in complete data set;  ? There is some instability in large distributed data set, which may affect on discovering the eventual of knowledge.

Sampling is a practical data reduction technique that has been applied to a variety of problems in database systems.

Zaki, et al.[6] use a simple random sample to obtain association rules, and John and Langley [7] discuss a dynamic sampling method that selects the sample size based on the observed behavior.

Chen, Haas and Scheuermann [8] propose a new two- phase sampling based algorithm for discovering association rules that in phase I, a large initial sample of transactions is collected and used to quickly and accurately estimate the support of each individual item in the database, and in phase II, a small final sample is obtained from the initial sample by trimming tactic.

II.  SAMPLING MINING ALGORITHM  A. SMA basic idea The SMA algorithm mines association rules as follows: a) Obtain an initial random sample Si from Di; b) Obtain a reduced sample set by using a two-way  sampling technique; c) Trim those large sample sets based on Minimum  entropy function; d) Generate a whole sampling database; e) Run a standard association rules algorithm to mine  the final association rules with minimum support p and confidence c.

B. Type of sampling How to choice initial sample in two-phase sampling is a  strategic problem, and the method is that such as simple random sampling with replacement (SRSWR), simple random sampling without replacement (SRSWOR), systematic random sampling (SRS) and so on. The SRSWR requires that each element has an equal probability of being included in the sample. In practice, SRSWOR is carried out, because there is no need to collect the information more than once from an element. Additionally, SRSWOR gives a smaller sampling variance than SRSWR. SRS selects every k-th element after a random start (between 1 and k), and if N denotes the number of transaction in initial database that there will be ? ?KN /  elements to compose initial sample.

Because the data of original transaction database is random, SRS is used to obtain initial sample.

C. Two-way sampling technique In the two-stage sampling process, the goal is to obtain a  smaller but more representative sample by trimming the initial sample at second phase. In other words, those unimportant   transactions are cut from the first samples, so that the final samples have higher precision. In the procedure of the cutting, we cite a distance function.

Let Di(1?i?n)be a partitioned database located in n sites S1,S2 ? Sn with their names as D1,D2 ? ? Dn respectively. We denote by Si initial samples obtained from Di, and by Ik(Di) the collection of k-itemsets in Di, and by FSi the final sample after implementation of the algorithm.

Let A and T be an arbitrary item set and transaction set respectively. We define n(A,T) to be the number of transactions in T that contain A and |T| to be the total number of transactions in T. Then the support of A in Di and in Si is given by Support(A,Di)=n(A,Di)/|Di| and Support(A,Si)=n(A,Si)/|Si|, respectively.

We use a distance function [8]:  ? )(?  )),(-),((),Si( SiIA k  SiASupportFSiASupportSiFDist =         (1)  to trim the initial samples based on two properties as follows:  ? For a transaction t?Si, compute function Dist(Si- {t},Si), and choice that transaction t whose value is minimum to be trimmed from sample Si. Because the function Dist(Si-{t},Si) reflects the importance of T in the sample Si, that is the more unimportant matters have the smaller value of the function.

? For a transaction t ? Si but FSit ?  , compute function Dist(FSi+{t},Si), and choice that transaction t whose value is maximum to be added to sample FSi. Because the function Dist(FSi+{t},Si) reflects the importance of T in the sample FSi, that is the more important matters have the greater value of the function.

This paper introduces SMA(Sampling Mining Algorithm), a two-way sampling technique that can trim some more unimportant transactions from Si and add other more important transactions to FSi based on two properties as above in every cycle. It is clear that the algorithm can accelerate the speed and reduce the cost of I / O operation in distributed database.

III. PERFORMANCE STUDY In this section we describe an empirical study carried out  to evaluate the performance of SMA. All experiments were performed on Genuine Intel(R) series Windows Server multi-user LAN with a processor speed of 173 MHZ. In LAN, there are three computers constitute distributed sites, and there are equal recorders in every site.

A. Experimental method In order to test the performance of the algorithm, we used  a synthetic database. The database D was generated using data synthesis method [1], then was divided equally to three sites. The total numbers of transactions and items are 390K and 1000 respectively, the number of maximal potentially global-frequent items is 1500, and the average length of transactions is 10, and the average length of maximal potential frequent itemsets is 4. We used a minimum support of 0.75%, at which level there would be neither too many nor too few frequent itemsets, and the length of the maximal frequent itemsets is 8.

B. Experimental result We performed experiments using SMA, SRS, DDDM  and FDMA. For each database, we executed algorithms 10 times, thus each performance data reported below is an average of 10 observations, but not be actual value at a time.

At first, we examined the performance of the different algorithms in terms of accuracy in a different sampling rate.

The measure of accuracy is defined as follows [9]:     input: distributed database Di ,the minimum support p, the minimum confidence c, the number of the final sample FSi.

output: global association rules .

As shown in the Fig. 1, SMA is more accuracy than SRS, and can quickly achieve a high level of accuracy at about 96%.

Execution time vs. support ratio  Secondly, we compare the performance of the different algorithms in terms of execution time in a different support ratio. The execution time includes sampling time and implementing time of the general mining algorithm. The sampling ratio is 15%, the remaining parameters remain the same, and the support ratios chosen are 0.75%, 1%, 1.25%, 1.5%, 1.75% and 2%. Fig. 3 illustrates the execution time of DDDM, FDMA and SMA. As shown in the fig. 2, SMA is faster than DDDM, and FDMA.



IV. CONCLUSIONS We have introduced in this paper a sampling algorithm to  mine association rules in distributed database, SMA adopts two-way sampling technique in every website, that is cutting out some unimportant transactions from initial samples, as well as adding other important transactions to the final results of the samples gradually. And trim those large sample sets based on Minimum entropy function. In an empirical study, it is clear that SMA was able to improve the accuracy and accelerate the speed of mining association rules in distributed database to a certain extent.
