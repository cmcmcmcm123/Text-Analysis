Gene-set Cohesion Analysis Tool (GCAT): a Literature Based Web Tool for

Abstract Numerous algorithms exist for producing gene sets  from high-throughput genomic and proteomic technologies.

However, analysis of the functional significance of these  groups of genes or proteins remains a big challenge. We  developed a web based system called Gene-set cohesion  analysis tool (GCAT) for estimating the significance level of  the functional cohesion of a given gene set. The method  utilizes Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) derived gene-gene  literature similarities to determine if the functional  coherence of a gene set is statistically significant compared to  that expected by chance. The robustness of the method was  determined by evaluating the functional cohesion for over  6000 Gene Ontology categories. Here, we demonstrate the  utility of GCAT for analysis of microarray data from  previously published experiments in which embryonic  fibroblasts were treated with interferon. Using GCAT, we  found the highest literature cohesion p-value (p= 1.37E-63)  corresponded to a set of genes that were differentially  regulated > 2-fold and had a t-test p-value <0.05, compared  to genes that were only changed >2-fold (literature p-  value=2.2E-44) or had a p-value <0.05 (literature p-  value=6.0E-32). As a control, genes that were changed less  than 2-fold or had a p-value >0.05 did not show a significant  literature cohesion. These results demonstrate that GCAT  can provide an objective literature-based measure to  evaluate the biological significance of gene sets identified by  different criterions.
