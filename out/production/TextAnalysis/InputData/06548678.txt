Figurative ?Cloud? The term comes from the common use of a cloud-shaped symbol as an abstraction for the Internet but application to virtual servers is as recent as 2006  ? Cloud computing is the use of resources (hardware and software) that are delivered as a service over the Internet or other network  What is Cloud Computing?

C L O U D  C O M P U T I N G  The cloud consists of terrestrial servers across the Internet that collectively store, manage and process data  Application Platform  Infrastructure  Monitoring  Content  Object Storage  Computation  Storage Collaboration  Communication  Financial Metrics  Content  Identity  Databases  Network  C  Cloud Computing Architecture    Public Cloud Providers  Community Cloud  Providers  Managed Services Private  Providers  Company Private Clouds  Shared between users  Private Infrastructure  Low Industry Expertise  High Industry Focus  ? Cloud computing services can be delivered by an internal IT organization (company-owned private cloud) or  ? By an external service provider (managed services private cloud or public cloud provider) or  What are Cloud Architectures?

C L O U D  C O M P U T I N G  In aviation cloud resources can be customized and shared among consortiums of customers (community cloud) or  shared with customers in other industries (public cloud)     What is Big-Data Analytics?

? The process of examining diverse, large-scale data sets to uncover  patterns, unknown correlations and other useful information  ? Organizations have different levels of (1) database management expertise and (2) knowledge to process and analyze big data sets ? ?Big data? is a relative term based on the user  ? Data tables in excess of ten terabytes (10TB) are difficult to work with using most relational database management systems, and particularly using desktop statistics and visualization packages, including Microsoft Excel and Access  ? Unstructured data sources in the operational world simply do not fit into desktop or small-scale database structures ? They can be hosted using cloud computing at lower cost, and mined  more efficiently, than with on-premises database architectures  B I G - D A T A  A N A L Y T I C S    What are Big-Data Analytics Tools?

? Big-data analytics employ software tools from advanced analytics  disciplines such as data mining and predictive analytics.

? Mining data, trends or analysis of these multi-terabyte data sets requires parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers to keep pace with user demands and processing expectations.

? A new class of big-data methods have emerged to address user demands for horizontal scaling and availability of underlying data  ? Hadoop and MapReduce, among others, offer fast processing speed.

? Great for large-scale static data sets, but not so great for real-time data  ? Most organizations employ a hybrid method combining technologies  ? A robust open source framework supports processing in clustered systems.

? Platform-as-a-service vendors (Microsoft, Amazon, Google) offer turn-key solutions for analysts to simply upload, link and compute basic data sets  ? Great for simple historical analysis; bad for real-time or diverse data sets  B I G - D A T A  A N A L Y T I C S    masFlight: A Global Aviation Data Warehouse and Big-Data Analytics Platform  M A S F L I G H T  Hybrid Architecture  ?

Smooth air with wind on the nose bearing 275 degrees at 18 KTS.

We were suddenly in moderate chop which lasted 4 or 5 seconds then stopped and then resumed for another 4 or 5 seconds with a significant amount of right rolling? I selected a max rate climb mode in the  FMC in order to climb above the wake and flight path of the leading -900. We asked ATC for the type ahead of us and reported the wake encounter. The -900 was about 3,300 FT higher than we were.?  ? Synopsis ? B737-800 First Officer reported wake encounter from preceding B737-900  with resultant roll and moderate chop.

What causal factors can be identified from this narrative that could be applied to future predictive applications?

C A U S A L  F A C T O R S  Data-mining algorithms can mine the text of safety reports to obtain specific data that can be used to analyze causal factors.

Example 2: Identifying Causal Factors  C A U S A L  F A C T O R S  Indicators ? Data Element Methods ? Identifying Context and Causes  ? Time of day  ? Date range (month, day)  ? Aircraft type  ? Fix or coordinates  ? Originating airport  ? Destination airport  ? Weather notes  We pinpoint the sequencing of flights on the IAH Junction Seven departure (at CUZZZ) during the specified wind conditions to find cases where a B737-900 at 20,000 feet precedes by 11 miles a B737-800 at 17,000 feet  ? Search related data sets including ASDI (flight tracks, local traffic and congestion)  ? Weather conditions for alternative causes (winds aloft, shear and convective activity)  ? Airline specific information (repeated occurrence of event in aircraft type)  Big data gives us visibility into contextual factors even if specific data points are missing such as a specific date or route.

Big-data analytics gives us insight into unreported factors as well.

Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were  practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  ? Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  ? There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  ? Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency.
