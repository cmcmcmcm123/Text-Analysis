I. INTRODUCTION The rapid evolution in communication technology facilitates  the Internet access, and makes it faster and cheaper. The advancement of Internet accessibility changes the paradigm of application usage methodologies. The new paradigm implies the access of massive number of users to the same cloud application.

As a result, data amount in application database reaches unprecedented sizes. Data-incentive cloud applications also have to deal with millions of requests every day. Good examples of such cloud applications are social platforms like Linked-in and Facebook [1].

The increase in the data amount and user load concretizes the scalability requirements for software components, especially for database technologies. Among all software components, scalability in data layer has been a popular topic in research community. Most relational database management systems (RDBMS) are not at desired level [2] in terms of solving the problems against both the increase of data amount in services and the load intensity. It is seen that NoSQL databases have been popular among the solutions that meet the scalability needs and big data processing.  Database solutions such as Cassandra [3], CouchBase [4], CouchDB [5], Dynamo [6], BigTable [7], MangoDB [8] are successful examples of applications in terms of horizontal scalability.

Telecommunication enterprise consists of both data and load insensitive applications. Telecommunication enterprise has to rely on centralized systems that comprises of several sub systems. This study describes the architectural process of a centralized telecommunication system in context of managing  enterprise work force, customer requests, call management and decision support.



II. SUB SYSTEMS Developed telecommunication application relies on the feed  of six basic subsystems. The first system that is to be handled is work force management system. Work force management system stores its data on Microsoft SQL Server RDBMS. Data contains personnel?s daily shift plans, holidays, permits, health reports etc. Work Force Management (WFM) data tables contain millions of records. However, RDBMS is still suitable for this sub system since less than a hundred management staff actively uses it.

Call management system uses hybrid storage solution to persist application data. Hybrid solution consists of file system and Oracle RDBMS. File system plays a buffering role to analyze and validate the real-time data before storing it in RDBMS.

Customer Support and Staff Rating (CSSR) system is built on top of IBM DB2 RDBMS. It is the data provider sub system that needs the least amount of data in our telecommunication application.

Call Rating System (CRS) uses a custom file system. It contains unstructured call records and call quality rating result associated with call record file.

Decision Support System (DSS) relies on a custom data warehouse solution. It provides de-normalized data, collected from several subsystems using Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) solution.

Staff Tracking System (STS) provides personnel?s turnstile transaction logs. It is a distributed system running on each location of company.



III. DATA MODEL The system presented in this study is responsible for business  decisions related to information collected from sub systems. It collects data, analyzes, merges and delivers to decision phase.

Additionally, it provides real-time requirement analysis for each team & department. It handles gigabytes of daily data and high volume of requests from thousands of active users.

ETL component of the system gathers data from more than five hundred relational tables. In this study, we will cover pre-    selected part of the data model. Key entities of sub-system?s data model (see Figure 1) is composed of seven entities such as Staff, Shift, Permit, Work Activity, Service, Turnstile Transaction, Department.

Data model of key entities  The Staff entity contains telecom?s personnel information.

Many attributes such as work type, manager info, average performance value that affects the decision takes part in this entity.

The Shift entity maps shift plans of whole department into each staff?s shift plans. Permit table holds the real-time and previously planned permissions that belong to staff.

Work activity is the most intensive table in terms of data size.

All daily activities of personnel are instantly recorded to this table.

In service table, location information and type of service that the personnel provide are stored. In turnstile transaction table, check-in and check-out information of personnel from all turnstile locations within the corporation are stored. Department table stores the team, division and hierarchy information between them.

For each personnel information request from the system, all of the related entities like staff, permit, shift and work activity tables has to be scanned. Although there are temporary solutions such as caching for permit and shift tables that are assumed to change daily, caching is not an effective solution for the work activity table that is updated continuously.

Furthermore, feeding the same table with different sources may cause data redundancy. Previous attempts tried to solve redundancy problem by re-scanning whole table to prevent re- inserting same data. However this solution made the systems unresponsive.

In our solution we decided to use document model. For this purpose we transformed relational data structure to document model (see Figure 2). In this context Shift, Permit, Work Activity, Turnstile Transaction tables are combined into a document structure called ActivityPackage. Each activity package is designed in a way that it contains all the activities that  the personnel has done or should do in the same day. Data that comes from different sources are first stored in RDBMS based Activity Queue Table and then synchronization service transforms relational data to ActivityPackage document.

IV. DATA STORES Developed system has to deal with millions of requests every  day. Previous RDBMS solutions with powerful and expensive hardware are not capable of handling daily workload since they rely on vertical scalability. However, common NoSQL solutions have already proven to perform better in terms of their horizontal scalability performance. It is easy to increase load capacity by adding new machines to NoSQL database cluster.

In this study, we use three types of data stores: Document Store, RDBMS, and File System.

A. Document Store Activity Packages are the primary sources of document  store. Documents are persisted in JSON format, which are the data structures capable of holding arrays and other complex information. JSON documents are flexible and information-rich structures that enable developers to model objects as individual documents. Activity packages are the most frequently used data type in our system. That is the major reason why we chose the document store for activity packages.

In terms of optimistic concurrency, we use check-and-set token (CAS) associated with document provided by document store. Document store checks a CAS value before changing the data; it effectively prevents data loss without having to lock records. Document store prevents a document from being altered by an operation if another process alters the document and its CAS value, in the meantime. Additionally, all update operations of Activity Package assigned to only one background service (daemon service).

B. RDBMS Real-time stream listener service captures multiple CMS  records at once. To handle multi-record transactions, it?s decided to use RDBMS in Activity queues.

C. File System File system is preferred to store unstructured files and real-  time buffering records.



V. DISTRIBUTION OF WORKLOAD Sources of workload in the system are covered under two  main titles.

A. Regular Background Tasks To generate live analysis results, system needs continuous  updates from its sub systems. To maintain this requirement, we designed several background services. All relational data gathering tasks are assigned to ETL service. ETL periodically checks for new records from subsystems and takes them in associated store.

Real-time stream capturing tasks are assigned to real-time listener (RTL) service. RTL continuously buffers stream data to file system.

Analyzing and parsing tasks are assigned to real-time parser (RTP) service. The RTP service checks for buffer size generated by RTL, validates and then parses the buffer package to save in activity queue.

Queue processing requirement is handled by real-time synchronization (RTS) service. RTS consists of several sub synchronization services. All of the sub services check for their associated queue store to handle their tasks. Queuing is the key mechanism in terms of providing system stabilization. To prevent size overflow in queue stores, each RTS sub service has right to pick additional thread from thread pool, and then leave it back to the pool, if the item size comes to the pre-defined threshold. Service workflow is presented in figure 3.

Once their deadline is passed, they become abandoned records.

In early attempts, we stored warnings and other disposable information in RDBMS and developed another service to delete  inactive records. In our final system design, all of disposable data are stored in document store, since it provides time-to-live (ttl) attribute for each document. TTL is an expiration time for a document specified in seconds. Document store automatically deletes values during regular maintenance, if the ttl for a document has expired.

A failure in any service will not affect other services since all of them run in independent app domains. With regular background task architecture, the most part of workload over the whole system became measurable and scalable.

A sample workload distribution of regular background tasks is shown in figure 4. When the user workload is in its lowest rate, system starts running daily ETL tasks. For this reason background task workload peaks at around 03:00am. In day time background tasks mainly focus on processing real-time data taken from CMS. As long as amount of captured real-time data decreases the workload of background tasks will also drop off.

Fig. 4.  Workload distribution of regular background tasks  B. User Workload Thousands of users actively use the system in their daily  work. All of the software patterns are developed according to cloud architecture [9]. When the workload increases, it is distributed by automatically increasing the number of application servers behind the load balancer.

Figure 5 shows one of the daily workload distribution of user requests.

VI.  CONCLUSION This work aimed to provide an example solution experienced  in centralized enterprise application. We examined how NoSQL based document store could be adapted according to the requirements of telecommunication enterprise.

Some solution providers attempted to solve this problem.

However they all failed because of several reasons. Since previous solutions didn?t run properly, we were not able to capture performance results to compare with our solution.

Our performance results and horizontal scalability requirements were the key factors of storage decision. Different from the previous studies [10], NoSQL solution used in our project has significant performance advantage over the competitive RDBMS solutions. In this project we determined to use both NoSQL and RDBMS solutions for data storage.

We conclude that when a system needs to provide a high  level of scalability, high performance, and flexibility in data structure, a NoSQL solution is well suited for the project. If it?s required to handle multi-record transactions or needed to perform rollback operations, a traditional RDBMS may be a better decision to use in a project.
