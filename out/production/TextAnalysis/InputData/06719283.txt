Extending the visualization capabilities   of a genome browser

Abstract?Scalable visualization of big data is highly desired in several fields. A demonstrative example is annotated genetic data, where the DNA sequence can be better visualized using space-filling fractal curves. Though such approaches are already available in the literature, they are not applied routinely in the clinical practice. The reason of this undesired fact is that clini- cians use well-established, but rather old gene browsers in their work. Naturally, these browsers lack state-of-the-art program- ming support and also visualization features. To help with this problem, in this paper, we propose a completion of a very widely used genome browser with scalable visualization techniques. The motivation of the work came from the clinical partner, since a good overview of the whole annotated DNA segment can lead to the recognition of currently unknown relations between genes.

We explain what steps were needed to add the new visualization feature to the browser in terms of graphical elements, data ex- traction, and a scalable user interface.

I. INTRODUCTION Efficient visualization of large amount of data (Big Data) is  an emerging trend worldwide. A common expectation towards the selected visualization technique is that it should be scalable.

In other words, the visualization approach should be able to handle the situation, when the amount of data is multiplied in the future. To resolve this issue such models are needed that can be refined basically in an infinite way. One natural selec- tion can be to map the data to fractals, which objects are also known as self-affine, which property meets the infinite scala- bility.

A specific field, where Big Data raise is genetics. DNA se- quences are composed from billions of nucleic acids, and ana- lyses that are more complex are also desired to be executed.

Among such complex approaches, we can find metagenomics, where complete microecologies are observed instead of indi- vidual organisms. Another demonstrative example is the de-  termination of associations between genes, which is important to explain specific diseases, but also the 3D spatial placement of the genome [1-3].

Clinical experts work with genome database in their daily routine in both medical care and research. Since genetic data analysis attained very strong interest from the beginnings ge- nome browsers have been developed, updated and used in the last few decades. These browsers support the access to fre- quently updated genome databases, and the visualization of the annotated genome sequences (also known as tracks). Several genome browsers are available for web-based usage, among which one of the most popular and widely applied tool is the UCSC Genome Browser [4-6].

In genome research, it is essential to visualize genetic data in an easily interpretable way that helps fast cognition and rec- ognition of relations/behavior. The rapid development of com- puter science and graphics, and the new knowledge on the spa- tial structure of genome made it available to meet the growing needs for attractive and more demonstrative visualization by offering corresponding techniques. However, efficient visuali- zation of genetic data is a very challenging task. The traditional visualization techniques considering graphs, points, lines, etc.

are less efficient here, since they ignore the scalability issue.

To overcome these difficulties, to accumulate genetic data, space-filling (e.g. Hilbert) fractal curves were recommended [7-9]. The advantage of this approach is that though this tech- nique cannot provide the true spatial behavior, but still closer than a simple line representation, and the creation of such curves is quite fast. Though these techniques are already avail- able, their incorporation into the traditionally widely used UCSC Genome Browser has not been solved yet. In this paper, we propose a way to add this important feature.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II, we give a brief description about the UCSC Genome Browser with focusing on the currently available visualization tech- nique, but also its implementation to see why this completion is far from trivial. The scalable visualization technique using       space-filling curves and its integration into the genome browser is described in section III. We give specific implementation details, since the completion is also designed for further im- provements. In section IV, we discuss on some common issues raising for new visualization solutions, and draw some conclu- sions, as well.



II. THE UCSC GENOME BROWSER  A. Features The UCSC Genome Browser is a very popular tool partly  because of its verbose, clear and user-friendly documentation.

The user can easily load genetic data in the browser from the largest genome databases including e.g. the complete human genome. Additional advantages of this browser are that it is updated regularly with data essential from both theoretical and practical view. That is, besides formerly uploaded data the lat- est genetic data are also available. As for visualization, the UCSC Genome Browser supports sequential visualization of the annotated genomic data. Different annotations can be vi- sualized in different tracks as shown in Fig. 1.

It is also possible to search within a DNA sequence, since textual support is also provided. Some navigation and zooming features are available; however, the browser does not support the automatic interpretation of the data. The browser is capable to compare two DNA sequences. This is a useful feature for regarding any visualization method, since the possible differ- ences along the sequences can be nicely observable as peaks in the annotation histograms. The main drawback regarding the visualization supported by the UCSC Genome Browser is that larger sequences cannot be seen as a whole. Our work was mo- tivated to overcome this problem.

B. Technical details One of the technologies the UCSC Genome Browser uses is  the Common Gateway Interface (CGI). The CGI programs can generate any content and write it to standard output, which is transferred to the client browser from the web server. This technology supports the creation of dynamic websites. Within the UCSC Genome Browser, 35 groups of CGI programs are available for communicating with the user. These programs are  written in C language with the source code is made publicly available. Some CGI programs serve to set up the connection with MySQL databases storing the genetic data and send one or more queries to it. Overall, we had to consider these require- ments to integrate the new visualization feature.



III. EXTENDING THE VISUALIZATION CAPABILITIES OF THE BROWSER  In this section, we describe how the visualization features of the UCSC Genome Browser are completed with adding a scalable, space-filling curve based technique. For filling a rec- tangular domain, we consider Hilbert curves, whose descrip- tion are given next. Then, we explain how this new visualiza- tion feature is integrated to the browser with giving the proper technical details of the implementation.

A. Hilbert curve-based visualization for genetic data The main advantage of using Hilbert curves in genetic data  visualization is that their self-affine behavior supports infinite scalability of the data. In other words, basically arbitrary large amount of data can be accumulated in these curves. Another important point of Hilbert curves is that though they are far being optimal in reflecting the real spatial behavior of the ge- nome, but still better approximate it than the sequential repre- sentation. Moreover, these curves can be easily, and thus rapid- ly generated [10].

The space-filling Hilbert curve is able to traverse through all the points of a square as Peano has shown that a line seg- ment can be recursively fragmented in such a way (see Fig. 2).

The resulting attractor curve is a fractal that is self-affine, that is, any smaller portion of the curve has just the same structure as the original one.

The Hilbert curves have a clustering behavior property, which makes them a useful tool for the visualization of genetic data. That is, the points that are close in the sequential repre- sentation are also close after mapping them to the curve. Thus, closer genetic pieces of information have patch-like appearance on the curve with the size of the patch corresponds to the car- dinality of the bases, while coloring indicates the annotation values [11].

Cs. L?mfalusi et al. ? Extending the visualization capabilities of a genome browser    There are several implementations available for the visuali- zation of genetic data with Hilbert curve. Such a tool is the HilbertVis software developed in the well-known statistical programming language R [12]. The HilbertVis tool is available both as a stand-alone application and as an R package [13, 14].

The GUI of HilbertVis contains several useful features for handling the data (e.g. scaling, coloring) as it can be seen also in Fig. 3. Because of its several positive features, we consi- dered the integration of HilbertVis into the UCSC Genome Browser.

B. Integrating visualization into the browser During the development, we considered various program-  ming technologies, like Java, Java Web Start, R etc. We have started with writing a script in the R language. This script in- cludes two packages: the packages HilbertVis and HilbertVis- GUI. Then, we have developed a simple Java applet that uses and executes the R script during through user interaction.

This application runs on client side. Because of security and permission problems, we use the Java Web Start technology with handling certificates. Using this technology, stand-alone Java applications can be deployed with a single click over the network. These Java Web Start applications are launched by using the Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP). During usage, the program code is downloaded to client side before running the Java application, and then it starts running on the user's computer.

A critical issue is how the data we would like to visualize is passed to the HilbertVis tool. For this task, we have to use a special file structure (WIG) as input requirement of HilbertVis.

As for the original usage of the UCSC Genome Browser, the user can select the interested genomic region and its annota- tion. Moreover, the genome browser supports the export of the data in GFF format [15], which we had to convert to WIG for- mat as shown also in Fig. 4.

Thus, we had to solve also the problem to pass the selected data automatically to the HilbertVis tool. Accordingly, we had to modify the C source of the hgTables CGI program. The hgTables CGI is responsible for the preparation of Table Browser, which is one of the pages of the UCSC Genome Browser (see Fig. 5).

This page was very useful for us, since it originally composed the genomic data selected by the user the appropriate GFF for- mat. We have created a new CGI program hgHilbert as a mod- ified version of hgTables. The main difference to let the new visualization available is shown in Fig. 6.

The hgHilbert program does not send directly the selected genomic data to the user, but it automatically extracts that for the visualization tool. After finishing all these steps, the Hil- bertVis tool loads and visualize the selected data automatically.

Since our primary aim was to provide an extension to the existing browser, we have inserted an extra item in the top menu of the main page of the UCSC Genome Browser called HilbertVis (see Fig. 7) that opens the modified Table Browser with linking to the hgHilbert program. In this way, the final step of integration is gained. As a summary, we present the components of our proposed system in Fig. 8 with indicating which elements are needed at both server and client side for the successful operation.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed a way to integrate a scala-  ble visualization technique into the UCSC Genome Browser.

The selected Hilbert curve-based technique allows visualiza- tion of large genetic annotation data in a more easily interpret- able way than traditional sequential methods, facilitating fast cognition and recognition of relations and data behavior.

Our primary motivation was to release a prototype, and based on the feedbacks on its usage in the clinical domain we plan some further improvements. As major revision points the HilbertVis tool of the R language could be replaced by devel- oping an own visualization framework. To reach this aim, we have already made the first step, since we have introduced Java platform, which can be easily improved by new graphical fea- tures, such as WebGL techniques. Moreover, we plan to test in what extent the actual efficiency of the usage of the browser raised through some adequate quantitative analysis of visuali- zation. Since besides the visualization of simple annotated data specific relationships between certain genomic segments can be important, we plan to extend to the fractal-based visualiza- tion techniques to 3D. Finally, if the prototype will be found as an efficient tool for the clinical domain, we plan to release our development in terms of an installation kit to upgrade the UCSC Genome Browser to support scalable visualization.
