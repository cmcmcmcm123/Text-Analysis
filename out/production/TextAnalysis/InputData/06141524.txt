New Application of Association Rules in Teaching Evaluation System

Abstract?Data mining is the process of finding correlations or patterns among dozens of fields in large relational databases.

In this paper we propose a novel association rules for data mining to improve the famous algorithm Apriori. The proposed approach uses the intersection operation to generate frequent item sets. It is different from the existing algorithm as it scans the database only one time and then uses the database to mine association rules. The proposed technique has been implemented in a teaching evaluation system, to enhance the foundation in performance evaluation for staff in teaching issues.

I.  INTRODUCTION Data mining is a kind of process of decision support. It  gets the potential and useful information and acknowledges from practical application data which is large, incomplete, noisy, ambiguous and random. Data mining relates to extracting a large of data from database, transforming, analyzing and modeling handling these data, and withdrawing the critical data to aid decision making. Mining association rules is an important issue in data mining [1]. R.

Agrawal et al in 1993 proposed the famous the Apriori algorithm based on frequent item set [2, 3], then the most algorithms are all based on the basic algorithm for improvements or derivative variant of  the algorithm [4 , 5].

An improved association rule is proposed in this paper, which uses the intersection operation to generate frequent item sets. The method can be easily realized using SQL language, which lays the basis of enhancing the performance of mining algorithm based on association rules.

This algorithm only needs to scan the database one time and then uses it to mine association rules in teaching evaluation system, which provides effective foundation to the scientificity of the teaching evaluation.



II. DATA MINING ANALYSIS METHOD BASED ON ASSOCIATIONRULE  A.  Association Rules The mining of association rules is the important research  direction of data mining area. Association rules reflect the inherent correlation among data. To find the inherent  correlation of data is helpful to maker to make correct and reasonable decision. Association rules model belongs to description model, and using the algorithm to find association rules belongs to unsupervised learning methods.

The data mining of association can be formal described, as shown in the follows:  Let I={i1, i2,?, im}, which is a collection consisting of of m different items. Given a transaction database D, and among it, every transaction T is a collection of a group items of I, namely T I, T has the unique identifier TID. An association rule is an implication formula such as X=>Y, and X I, Y I, X?Y=?. The conditions of association rules to set up are:  It has the support degree S, namely at least there are S% transactions in transaction database which contain X Y;  It has confidence level C, namely in all the transactions containing X of transaction database D, there are at least C% transactions which contain Y too.

The basic task of association rules is to mine the strong rules (rules with high support degree and confidence level which are called strong rules). That mining association rules can be divided into two phases [6]: (1) mining big item collection, the transaction support degree S is higher than the pre-determined minimum threshold item. (2) using big item collection to produce the association rules whose confidence level C is higher than the pre-determined minimum threshold item in the database. The whole performance of mining association rules is decided by the first phase. After determining a big item collection, the corresponding association rules can be derived. So the key to improve association rule for data mining algorithm is to effectively calculate big item collection.

B. Apriori Algorithm Apriori [7, 8, 9] is an algorithm to calculate the specific  length of item collection of the given database. Apriori calculates the frequent item sets in the database iteratively level by level, the calculation in i-th iteration provides all the i-item frequent item sets.

An improved Apriori is proposed in this paper. It needs  to scan the database only one time and create a logo for each data item list. The support of frequent item sets is obtained   13C978-1-4244-8598-7 /10/$26.00      2010 IEEE        by logo list intersection. This can reduce the scanning times.

The method can be easily realized by using SQL language.



III. IMPROVED APRIORI ALGORITHM The improved algorithm is mainly improved when  generating frequent item sets. The main idea is based on the intersection operation.

Definition 1 Lk*Lk={p q, and p,q?Lk,p.item1= q.item1,?, p.itemk-1 = q.itemk-1, p.itemk<q.itemk}         (1)  When k=1, the operator expresses single connection.

For example :suppose L2={BC,BD},Support set of  itemset {BC} is{002,003,004,006}, Support set of itemset {BD} is {002,003,004,006},According to according  to definition 1 we can get L2*L2={002,003,004} without scanning database.

A. Description of Improved Apriori Algorithm[10] L1 = {large 1-sets};  // L1 is made up of itemset , tset set and support.

for ( k = 2; Lk-1 ? ?; k++)  do Ck = gen ( Lk-1); //k length frequent itemsets are generated.

end Answer  := k Lk;  Function gen()  is Lk-1 as input, and the results can be  directly generated k-item frequent item sets. Function Gen  is as follows:   Function Gen ( Lk-1) {  Ck ={ Lk-1.Itemset * Lk-1.Itemset} // candidates are generate according  to definition 1.

Tk ={ Lk-1.Tset ?Lk-1.Tset}  for all candidates c ? Ck do c.support=Count(c.Tk);  If c.support < minsup then delete c  end end  }  B. Applications We use table I as an example to illustrate the algorithm.

TABLE I.  A SIMPLE  TRANSACTION  DATABASE  Tran saction ID Itemset 001 A, C, D 002 A, B, C, D, E 003 B, C, D 004 A, B, C, F 005 D, E, F 006 B, C, D, F    This algorithm only needs to scan the database once , then create the following database tables II.

According to table II, we can calculate the elements number of each row (that is transaction support number), then delete those itemsets whose support number are less than that of a given threshold support of items set. And thus 1-item frequent itemsets are got. In table II, itemset {E} is canceled because of its support number is 2,which is less than the given threshold.

TABLE II.  NEW  CREATION  DATABASE  Itemset Support Set A  001,002,004  B  002,003,004,006  C  001,002,003,004,006  D  001,002,003,005,006  E  002,005  F  004,005,006  According to the one length of large itemsets, support set of itemset uses intersection operation between each other, and calculate the row number of elements, then delete those whose support are less than a given threshold support of items set. And two length of large itemsets are got.

TABLE III.  ONE LENGTH OF LARGE ITEM SETS  Itemset Support Set Support A  001,002,004  3 B  002,003,004,006  4 C  001,002,003,004,006  5 D  001,002,003,005,006  5 F  004,005,006  3  TABLE IV.  TWO  LENGTH  OF  LARGE ITEMSETS  Itemset Support Set Support A,C  001,002,004  3  B,C  002,003,004,006  4  B,D  002,003,006  3  C,D  001,002,003 006  4  According to the two length of large itemsets, we can get three length of large itemsets.

TABLE V.  THREE  LENGTH  OF  LARGE  ITEM SETS  Itemset Support Set Support B,C,D  002,003 006  3  There is only one three length of large item sets, so algorithm ends.



IV. THE APPLICATION OF IMPROVED ALGORITHM IN THE TEACHING EVALUATION  SYSTEM Teaching evaluation is a process of value judgment and  improvement to teaching effect and the realization degree of teaching target according to the teaching target and teaching          standards. Ever since a long time, the evaluation of teacher works only focused on quantity, not on quality, which leaded to unscientific evaluation and quantification. There are important theory meaning and practical application value to enhance teachers level and teaching quality, promote the development of education that how to scientifically, accurately, objectively evaluate the teaching effect of teachers.

In database, the original data of students? evaluation on 2007-2008 spring semester?s teaching is shown in table VI.

In data table, there are part of the data of student evaluation on teaching. Column heading bpr is teacher number, pgr is student number, pgnr is course number, zb1,zb2,zb3 and zb4 are different indexes separately, zp is overall evaluation, zgpj is the subjective points of view of the  students.

TABLE VI.  ORIGINAL RECORDS TABLE OF STUDENT EVALUATION ON TEACHING  Bpr Pgr pgnr Zb0 zb1 zb2 Zb3 Zb4 zb5 zb6 zb7 zb8 zb9  25062 21505130 25011 B A A A A B A A A A  25006 25505131 25035 A A A A A A A A A A  25062 25605108 25011 A A B B A A A A A A  25022 25501101 25278 A C A A A A A A A B  21011 21501132 21218 A A A A A A B B B A  22067 21502191 22245 A A A A A A A B A A Indicators 1 (zb0), indicator 2 (zb1)... indicator 9 (zb8),  General Comments (zp9)are stored in the form of storage.

For each indicator, it may appear four forms of assessment (A, B, C, D). Each indicator is given a corresponding number.

For example: zb0 evaluation forms have A0, B0, C0 and D0 four forms of assessment.

Each Indicators has different weight power .  the weight power table as shown in table VII.

TABLE VII.  WEIGHT POWER  OF EVERY INDICATORS  NO. Evaluation index Weight power 1 Zb0 11 2 Zb1 11 3 Zb2 8 4 Zb3 8 5 Zb4 11 6 Zb5 11 7 Zb6 10 8 Zb7 12 9 Zb8 8 10 Zb9 10  Four forms of assessment (A, B, C, D) values were 0.95,0.8,0.65,0.4.

We use Asp.net as the system's main development tools, Microsoft SQL Server 2000 as backend database. Figure 1 is evaluation of web pages.

Some results screenshot are as follows.

Figure 1.  Evaluation of web pages    Figure 2.  Evaluation Results.

So we can conclude that in all courses, the total curriculum is B closely related to them as teachers, warm and caring to students, strict requirements.



V. CONCLUSIONS With the increase of teaching data information, data  mining technology is applied into teaching evaluation, which can enhance the technology level, science, objectivity and impartiality of teaching evaluation and service teaching work better. The paper uses association rules of data mining to build the reasonable evaluation index system and teaching index method based on data mining. Through the feedback and investigation of 968 teaching evaluation results of 2007- 2008 autumn semester, the method of evaluation teaching has been approved by all teachers, which proves the method is valid.
