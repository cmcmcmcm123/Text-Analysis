I. INTRODUCTION Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is one of the most useful  techniques, which are used to detect the incipient faults of power transformer[1]. The fault related gases include methane (CH4), acetylene (C2H2), ethane (C2H6), ethylene (C2H4).In the past decade[2], various fault diagnosis techniques have been proposed that include the conventional ratio method to detect the incipient faults of power transformer[3]. The conventional gas ratio method is based on experience in fault diagnosis using DGA data.

Rough set is a new mathematical approach, which has the function of imprecision, vagueness and uncertainty[4,5].

Rough set philosophy is founded on the assumption that we associate some information[6-8]. In the paper, association rules will be gained by rough set, and used to fault diagnosis of power transformer. Rough set can mine the deep relation, association rules of power transformer is gained by rough set. CH4/C2H4,?C2H2/C2H4, C2H4/C2H6, C2H2/C2H6, C2H6/CH4,?C2H2/CH4 can reveal the relation between the gases ratios and failure in power transformer, and the feature gases are used to construct 6 ratios. By reduction of rough set, redundant feature attribute which affects the classification performance will be deleted. Then, association rules of power transformer is gained. The experimental results indicate that the method has very good results.



II. ROUGH SET Rough set is a very important information processing  tool, by the tool, the problem with imprecise, uncertain and vague information will be solved. Define an information system S <U, A, V, f>, where U denotes a nonempty finite set, A denotes a nonempty finite set of attributes, A=C D , where C represents the conditional attributes, D represents the decision attributes. V is the value domain, f is an information function. It is necessary for us to find out the key conditional attributes with the reference to the decision-making because the decision table obtained may be huge. The process of rough sets will comprise the following parts:  1) If the data is not discrete, the data must be scattered; 2) Decision table will be constructed by using all  descriptors, and discernibility matrix will be constructed by using all descriptors;  3) Decision table will be constructed by using specific reduct, discernibility matrix will be constructed by using specific reduct;  4) The redundant condition attributes are deleted, and the repetitious rows are deleted.



III. ASSOCIATION RULES GAINED BY ROUGH SET The fault related gases include methane (CH4),  acetylene (C2H2), ethane (C2H6), ethylene (C2H4), which can reflect the states of transformer.

CH4/C2H4,C2H2/C2H4,C2H4/C2H6,C2H2/C2H6,C2H6/CH4,?C2H 2/CH4 can reveal the relation between the gases ratios and failure in power transformer, and the feature gases are used to construct 6 ratios. As shown in Tab.1, condition attribute of decision table of power transformer is composed of the following ratios: CH4/C2H4, ?C2H2/C2H4, C2H4/C2H6, C2H2/C2H6, C2H6/CH4, ?C2H2/CH4,?which are represented as F1~F6 respectively. Condition attribute of diagnostic decision table is the five states of power transformer including normal, high energy discharge, low energy discharge, high temperature overheating, low temperature overheating, which are represented as 1,2,3,4,5 respectively.

By the reduction of rough set, minimal decision table is gained, which is given in Tab.2.
