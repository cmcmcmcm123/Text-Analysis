Triple Code: An Efficient Labeling Scheme for Query  Answering in XML Data *

Abstract?Labeling schemes play crucial roles in the processing of XML queries. Designing labeling scheme that can support various common structural relationship queries (such as PC, AD, SR, DO, and LCA) among nodes, has received much research attention. Although there have existed a variety of labeling schemes such as prefix-based labeling, interval-based labeling and integer-based labeling and as well as their variants, these labeling schemes show weakness in one aspect or another. Interval-based labeling schemes can answer AD, PC and DO queries efficiently and can be created fast, but they can?t process SR and LCA.

Prefix-based labeling and integer-based labeling can process all of common structural relationship queries, but they are far less efficient than interval-based labeling for AD and DO queries. In this paper, we propose a new interval-based labeling scheme, called Triple code, which has a good performance on construction time, storage cost and query cost. In addition, to optimize the performance of LCA computation in XML data with big depth, we propose iTriple code (Triple code with information of ancestor). Experiment results demonstrate the benefits of our proposed labeling schemes over the previous approaches.

I. INTRODUCTION The rise of XML as a de facto standard for data exchange  and representation has generated a lot of interests on querying XML documents modeled as an ordered tree. Query languages such as XPath and XQuery have been designed to process XML data, which include queries of structural relationships among nodes, such as Parent/Child (PC), Ancestor/Descendant (AD), Sibling Relationship (SR) and Document Order (DO).

Moreover, to facilitate users to search XML Data, lots of algorithms for XML keyword search have been proposed, in which computing Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) is the core operator. To speed up processing of these common structural relationships queries, a lot of labeling schemes have been proposed. Hence, a good labeling scheme should have the following characteristics:  ? Compact: it must be enough compact and fit in the main memory.

? Flexible: it can support all kinds of structural relationship queries including AD, PC, SP, DO and LCA.

? Efficient: the structural relationships can be computed fast using the labeling and it can be created efficiently.

Existing labeling scheme can be classified into three major classes: interval-based labeling [1 4], prefix-based labeling [5, 6] and integer-based labeling [7, 8]. These labeling schemes show weakness in one aspect or another.

Interval-based labeling schemes are efficient and compact, which have been a huge success in XML twig pattern matching.

Another significant advantage of them is that this type of labeling is independent of the structure of the tree, like depth of a tree. However, this kind of scheme is not flexible, which can?t support the determination of SR and the computation of LCA. Prefix-based labeling schemes are flexible, which have been widely adopted in XML keyword search processing.

Dewey labeling scheme [5] is the representative of this kind of schemes, which has an outstanding performance in computing LCA. However, compared with interval-based labeling, this kind of labeling isn?t compact and isn?t efficient for AD, PC, and DO. Moreover, because they are influenced by depth and fan-out of nodes, this kind of schemes doesn?t work well for deep and complex trees. Integer-based labeling schemes are flexible and more compact than prefix-based labeling schemes.

But, this kind of labeling has the longest construction time in the three kinds of labeling. In addition, because, in testing the structural relationship of nodes, they will use arithmetic operations among big integers, such as mod and subtraction, they are less efficient than interval based labeling. The state-of- the-art labeling scheme, Branch code [7] belongs to this kind of labeling.

Finally, in Table 1, we summarize these typical labeling schemes as well as our two new labeling schemes in term of their storage cost and query time based on worst-case analysis.

Here, N is the number of nodes and d is the depth of the tree.

From Table 1, we can see that interval-based labeling [4] has satisfied two characteristics (Efficient and Compact) of a good labeling. In fact, we find that interval-based labeling scheme has the most query performance for AD and DO in three kinds of labeling schemes. Moreover, the effect of size and structure of XML documents on construction time and query cost of this kind labeling is very small. Can we design a labeling scheme which not only can inherit the advantages of interval-based labeling, but also can overcome the shortcoming that interval-based labeling can?t support SR and LCA queries?

Inspired by this, we propose a new labeling, Triple code, which  2013 10th Web Information System and Application Conference  DOI 10.1109/WISA.2013.17   2013 10th Web Information System and Application Conference  DOI 10.1109/WISA.2013.17   2013 10th Web Information System and Application Conference  DOI 10.1109/WISA.2013.17   2013 10th Web Information System and Application Conference  DOI 10.1109/WISA.2013.17   2013 10th Web Information System and Application Conference  DOI 10.1109/WISA.2013.17     assigns each node a triple (start, end, parentid). For XML tree with big depth, Triple code can?t support LCA efficiently. So, we propose another novel labeling, called iTriple code with information of ancestors.

In summary, this paper makes the following contributions: ? First, we propose a new interval-based labeling scheme,  Triple code, which satisfies the tree conditions of a good labeling scheme. As shown in experiment section, Triple Code has excellent performances on construction time, storage cost and query cost. The influence of tree size and depth on it is very little. Moreover, it is easy to be extended to support updates of leaf nodes and interval nodes.

? To further optimize performance of LCA query of Triple Code, we propose another labeling scheme, iTriple Code.

For XML data with big depth, the effect of tree depth on construction time and query performances of it is very small and it has good query performances.

? We implement Dewey code, Branch code and our two new labeling schemes and conduct extensive experiments on both real data and synthetic data, on three benchmarks: construction time, storage cost and query time.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews Background and related work. We present our new labeling scheme Triple code in Section 3. Section 4 describes another new labeling scheme we proposed, iTriple code.

Section 5 discusses how to extend our labeling schemes for dynamic XML trees. Section 6 gives the experiments result.

We conclude in Section 7.



II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK  A. Structural Relationship Query among Nodes Parent/Child (PC), Ancestor/Descendant (AD), Sibling  Relationship (SR) and Document Order (DO) and Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) are five classes of common structural relationship queries among nodes, which have got lots of intentions from researchers. The First Four are the core operators of XPath and XQuery recommended by W3C. The last is the core operator of XML keyword search. In XPath and XQuery, there are 13 kinds of axes and most of them are related with the structure of XML document. In them, self axe is easy to process. Ancestor, ancestor-or-self, descendant and descendant-or-self axes can be transformed into AD queries to process. Parent, child and attribute axes can be transformed into PC queries to process. Following and preceding axes can be transformed into DO queries to process. Following-sibling and Preceding-sibling can be transformed into DO and SR  queries to process. In addition, Predicates of XPath and XQuery have structural queries related with the position of nodes. This kind of queries also can be transformed into SR and DO to process. For example, /bookstore/book[position() =3], this query selects the third book element that are children of the bookstore element. For this query, we first use PC query to find all of book nodes with a bookstore parent. Then find all book nodes sets with sibling relationship query in got results, through SR. At last, find the final results in those book nodes sets, through DO query. In XML keyword search, the core operation is to find the lowest element node which can includes all of keywords. Obviously, this is a LCA query.

B. Related Work Existing labeling schemes can be classified into three major  classes: interval based labeling [1 4], prefix-based labeling [5, 6] and integer-based labeling [7, 8].

The first Interval-based labeling is proposed by Santoro, et al[3]. To label the XML tree based on the interval-based scheme, different tree traversal methods (e.g. pre-and-post order[1] and extended preorder[2]) are used. The labeling proposed by Zhang et al [4] is widely used, in which each node is assigned three values: start, end and level. Utilizing these values, we can determinate various structural relationships (except for SR and LCA) between two nodes efficiently. In our two labeling schemes, the processing of DO and AD is the same as zhang labeling. But, for PC, our two labeling schemes are more efficient than zhang labeling, because we only need compare if the parentid values of two nodes are equal.

Moveover, our labelings can process SR and LCA efficiently.

In Prefix-based labelings, the label of a node is its parent?s label (Prefix-label) concatenated with its own label (self-label).

Dewey code [5] is a typical prefix-based labeling scheme, which has been widely adopted in XML keyword search. The label size of each node is influenced by the depth of tree. So, the query performance and storage cost are influenced by the depth of trees. Integer-based labelings use integers to label nodes and determinate the structural relationship of nodes by arithmetic operations among integers. Primecode[7] and Branch[8] code belong to this class. Branch code is the state of the art of scheme. It has been proved that Branch code is more efficient than Prime code. In most of cases, this kind of labeling is more compact than Dewey code, but its construction time is the longest in three kinds of labeling schemes.

In this paper, we propose two new labeling schemes Triple Code and iTiple Code, which can support AD, PC, SR, DO and LCA efficiently. From experimental results, we can see they have better performances on construction time and query time than previous labelings. The influence of tree size on construction time, storage cost and query performances of Triple Code is less than Dewey Code and Branch Code. The influence of tree depth on query performances of iTriple Code is the least.



III. TRIPLE CODE Definition1 (Triple Code). The Triple Code of a node v in  an ordered XML tree T, is a triple <start, end, parentid>, where start is the first value of an interval, end is the second value of     an interval, and parentid is the node ID of v?s parent. Note that these intervals are generated by once depth-first traversal. Any two intervals only have two kinds of relationships that one interval is contained by another interval or one interval doesn?t intersect with another interval. As an example of Triple code, we label the XML tree in Fig.1 (a) by Triple code.

Fig. 1. Example Results in real datasets  In Triple Code, the determinations of AD and DO are the same as interval-based labeling scheme. For any node u and v, u is an ancestor of v if and only if u.start < v.start and u.end > v.start. u is preceding (following) node of v if and only if u.start<v.start (u.start>v.start). Other structural relationship determinations will be given in Theorem 1-4.

Theorem1 (Parent-Child Determination). For any two nodes u and v in a XML tree, u is the parent of v if and only if v.parentid = u.

Theorem2 (Sibling Relationship Determination). For any two nodes u and v in a XML tree, u is a sibling node of v if and only if v.parentid = u.parentid.

Theorem3 (Lowest Common Ancestor query of two nodes in Triple). For two node u and v, let u.start < v.start and P = v1v2?vk be the corresponding path from root v1 to vk = v in the XML tree. Then the LCA of u and v, lca(u,v) = argmax{x.start : x.start <= u.start and x P}.

Proof. First, we can see that lca (u,v) is an ancestor of v.

Hence, lca (u,v).start < v.start and lca (u,v).end > v.start. Then, lca (u,v).end > u.start. By the definition of lca(u,v), lca(u, v).start < u.tart. So, lca (u, v) is an ancestor of u too. Suppose that lca (u, v) is not the lowest common ancestor of u and v.

Then it must exist a node vi P that is the lowest common ancestor. Since vi and lca (u, v) are in the same path, lca (u, v) must be an ancestor of vi. So, lca (u, v).start < vi.start, which is contradictory to the definition of lca (u, v). So, lca (u, v) must be the lowest common ancestor of two nodes.?  Theorem4 (Lowest Common Ancestor query of multiple nodes in Triple). For a node set S, let u = argmin{x.start : x S}, v = argmax{x.start: x S} and P = v1v2?vk be the corresponding path from root v1 to vk = v. Then the LCA of all nodes in S, lca(S) = lca(u, v).

Proof. Since lca(u,v) is the lowest common ancestor of u and v, lca(u,v) must be the lowest common ancestor of all nodes in S if it is a common ancestor of all nodes in S. Hence, we only need to prove that lca(u,v) must be a common ancestor of all nodes in S. Suppose that w S is not a descendant of lca(u,v). Then, w.start < lca(u,v).start or w.start > lca(u, v).end.

Since w.start > u.start and w.start < v.start, w.start > lca (u, v).start and w.start < lca(u, v).end, which is contradictory to the assumption. Therefore, lca (S) is a common ancestor of all  nodes of S. Then lca (S) is the lowest common ancestor of all nodes of S. ?  Exampel1. We take the tree in Fig.1 (a) for example, which is labeled by Triple code, to show the correctness of our approaches.

? Ancestor-Descendant Relation Determination. Node v0 is an ancestor of Node v5, since v0.start (0) < v5.start (12) and v0.end (17) > v5.start (12). Node v3 is not an ancestor of Node v5, since v3.end (9) < v5.start (12).

? Parent-Child Relation Determination. Node v0 is a parent of Node v2, since v2.parentid (0) < v0. Node v4 is not a parent of Node v6, since v6.parentid (0) v 4.

? Sibling Relation Determination. Node v2 is a sibling node of Node v4, since v2.parentid (0) < v4.parentid (0). Node v4 is not a sibling node of Node v8, since v8.parentid (6) v4.parentid (0).

? Document Order Relation Determination. Node v1 is a preceding node of Node v2, since v1.start (1) < v2.start (3).

Node v4 is a following node of Node v2, since v4.start (7) > v2.start (3).

? LCA Computation. The LCA of Node v3 and Node v5 is Node v0, since v3.start (4) < v5.start (8), v4.start (7) > v3.start (4) and v0.start (0) < v3.start (4).

Complexity analysis: In constructing Triple, we only need depth-first traverse once, so its construction cost is O (N).

Triple Code consists of three integers. In fact, each integer must be less than 2N. So the storage cost is O (N). The query cost of SR, PC, AD and DO is O (1). For LCA, in the worst- case, we need access at most d times labels of nodes. Because all of labels reside in memory, each access cost is O (1). So, the worst-case query cost of LCA is O (d). Here, N is the size of a tree and d is the depth of a tree.



IV. ITRIPLE CODE From example1, we can see that computing LCA needs to  access ancestors? labels many times. The processing of LCA is deep influenced by tree depth. For deep trees, the LCA query will needs much time. To overcome this disadvantage, we propose a new labeling scheme, iTriple Code, to optimize the LCA query performance from O (d) to O (logd), where d is the depth of a tree.

Instinctively, if we construct an ordered list with the information of its ancestors for each node, the LCA query cost will be greatly reduced by the binary query. However, that will increase label size largely. Then, we find an approach that we only need construct ancestor lists for leaf nodes. As shown in Fig.1(b), the ancestor list of a leaf node v only stores the start value of v s ancestor from the root to its parent. Here, the list must be ordered because the start value of an ancestor must be less than the start values of its descendants.

Definition 2(iTriple Code): The iTriple Code of a node v in an ordered XML tree T, is a quaternary < start, end, parentid, pt >, where start is the first value of an interval, end is the second value of an interval, parentid is the node ID of v?s     parent, and pt refers to the ancestor list of a v?s descendant leaf node.

In constructing the value pt of node u from down to top, we let u.pt equal to the pt of its first child. Fig2.(b) shows an example of iTiple Code. The determinations of AD, PC, SR and DO of iTriple Code are the same as Triple Code.

Following, we will present how to compute the LCA by iTiple Code, shown as Theorem 5(find the LCA of two nodes) and Theorem 6(find the LCA of a set of nodes).

Theorem5(LCA query of two nodes in iTriple). For two node u and v, let u.start < v.start. Then the LCA of u and v, lca?(u,v) = argmax{x.start : x.start ??u.start and x.start v.pt}.

Proof. Let p = v1v2? vi?vk be the path corresponding to v.pt, where v1 is the root of a XML tree, vi = v and vk is a leaf node.

First, for any node vj(i + 1 ??j ? k), w must be a descendant of v. Then, u.start < w.start. So, lca?(u,v) must be a node vf (1 ??f ??i 1). From Theorem 3, lca?(u, v) must be the LCA of u and v.

?  Theorem6 (LCA query of multiple nodes in iTriple). For a node set S, let u = argmin{x.start : x S} and v = argmax {x.start : x S}. Then the LCA of all nodes in S, lca?(S) = lca?(u, v).

Proof. The proof is the same as Theorem 4. ?  Algorithm1 shows the algorithm to compute the lowest common ancestor of two nodes by iTriple code. Lines 3-4 process the case that one node is an ancestor of the other. In this case, the ancestor is just the LCA of the two nodes. Lines 5-16 process the case that two nodes haven?t AD relationship.

Lines 7-15 use a binary-search-like approach to find the maximal start value less than v1.start in v2.pt. From Theorem 5, we know that lca?(u,v) is just the right LCA of u and v. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(logd) in the worst case.

Algorithm1: LCA computation in iTriple  Input : iTriple code L, u and v Output: lca(u,v)  1 begin 2 v1 = argmin {x.start : x = u or v};v2 = argmax{x.start : x = u or v} 3 if v1.start < v2.start < v1.end then 4      lca(u, v) = v1 5 else 6        //find the maximal start value less than v1.start 7        s = 1 ; t = length(v2.Iid); 8        while s? t do 9            if v2.pt[mid] > v1.start then //mid = (s + t)=2; 10                t = mid ? 1 11          else 12                if v2.pt[mid + 1] > v1.start then 13                      s = mid; break 14               else 15                      s = mid + 1 16      lca(u,v)=v(s)//v(s) is the node corresponding to s  Complexity analysis: In constructing iTriple code, we only need once depth-first traverse. For each leaf node, we need copy ancestors in stack to its ancestor list. So, the construction  cost is O(dN) in the worst case. iTriple Code consists of three integers and one pointer(space cost O(N)) and the extra space cost for leaf nodes is O(dN) in the worst case. So, the total storage cost isO(dN). The query cost of SR, PC, AD and DO is O(1). As shown in Algorithm 2, the worst-case query cost of LCA is O(logd).



V. DISCUSSION So far, there have existed lots of approaches to process  updates of labeling schemes, such as Float-point [11], CDBS [10], DDE [9], and Branch Code. The first two can be used to support updates of interval-based labeling scheme. CDBS and DDE can support updates of prefix-based labeling scheme.

Branch Code uses splay tree to support updates of labels.

However, they only considered updates of leaf nodes and the updates of interval nodes were rarely discussed in the past.

Actually, the insertion or deletion of an interval will result in an error in answering LCA, PC and SR. For prefix-based and integer-based labeling schemes, the label of a node depends on labels of its parent and its ancestors. So, when inserting or deleting an internal node, the labels of its descendants must be changed.

Using the method of CDBS, our labeling schemes are easy to be extended to support efficient updates of interval nodes and leaf nodes and make sure that our labelings can answer AD, PC, SR, DO, and LCA correctly after updating. Here, Like CDBS, we use bit string to represent start and end, but parentid is still represented with an integer. Then, Triple code can process updates of leaf nodes without relabeling existing labels and can process updates of internal nodes, only with relabeling its children. iTriple code also support updates of leaf nodes without relabeling existing labels. In deleting or inserting an interval node v, besides relabeling labels of v?s children, iTriple code only need update ancestor lists of v?s leaf descendants. So, for updates of internal nodes, iTriple code is less efficient than Triple code, but still more efficient than previous labeling schemes.



VI. PERFORMANCE STUDY In this section, we empirically evaluate the performance of  Triple code and iTriple Code proposed by us. In particular, we are interested in following aspects: 1) the performances of Triple Code labeling in three important measures: query time, storage code (label size) and construction time, 2) the influence of tree size/depth on construction time, storage cost and query performance of Triple code, 3) the performances of iTriple Code in three important measures in processing deep XML data and 4) the influence of tree depth on construction time, storage cost and query performance of iTriple code.

A. Experiment Setup Here, we use five real XML datasets [12] including Sigmod  (Num. of node:11526, avg./max.depth:5.14/6), Univ (Num.of node: 66729, avg./max.depth: 3.95/5), TPC (Num.of node:20001, avg./max.depth: 2.9/3 ), Mondial (Num.of node:22423, avg./max.depth: 3.6/5) and Nasa (Num.of node: 476646, avg./max.depth: 5.58/8 ), and two kinds of synthetic datasets. The depth of one synthetic data set is from 10 to 60     with and each tree has 105 nodes. In constructing them, we first generate a tree with 100 leaf nodes with the specified depth as a seed, where other nodes except the root have one child and the root has 100 children. Then, randomly construct the left parts of the tree. The node size of the other set is from 105 to 106. We randomly select N-1 edges which can generate a tree, where N is the number of nodes. To evaluate the performance of query, we randomly generate 105 node pairs for each XML tree and each kind of query. Here, we only show the results of AD, DO and LCA. One reason is that Triple Code and iTriple code can answer SR and PC by comparing two integers and they are more efficient than other kinds of labeling schemes obviously. The other reason is the limitation of space.

For comparisons, we implement Dewey code (a typical prefix- based labeling) and Branch Code (the state of art of labeling, an integer-based labeling). We don?t implement typical interval-based labeling, because it can?t support SR and LCA.

We run all experiments on a PC running Ubuntu 11.03 with an Intel Quad 2.53GHz CPU and 8GB memory and implement four labeling schemes with C++. In them, Triple code and iTriple Code are supposed by us.

B. Performance of Triple Code and iTriple Code Construction time. As shown in Fig.2 (a), Fig.3(a), and  Fig.4(a), the construction time of Triple code in all of data sets is the least. For deep XML trees shown in Fig.5 (a), the construction time of iTriple code is far less than Dewey code and Branch Code and is very close to the time of Triple Code.

Fig. 2. Results in real datasets  Storage cost. As shown in Fig.2(b), Fig.3(b) and Fig.4(b), except for Univ and Nasa, the storage cost of Triple code is the least in all of trees. For deep XML trees shown in Fig.4(b), the storage cost of iTriple code is less than Dewey Code while the depth is more than 10, and in 60, its storage cost is less than  Branch Code. Here, the storage code of iTriple code includes the cost of ancestor lists of all of leafs. We represent storage cost by total bytes/node size, and it is the same in the following parts in this paper.

Query Performance. As shown in Fig.2(c-e) and Fig.3(c-e), in all of XML data, Triple Code has the best Query Performances including AD, DO and LCA. For deep XML trees shown in Fig.4(c-e), Tripe Code and iTriple Code have the best query performances including AD, DO and LCA. The query performances of AD and DO of iTriple Code are the same as Triple Code. The query performance of LCA of iTriple Code is better than Triple Code, which verifies our theories.

C. Inuence of tree size on Triple Code Influence of tree size on construction time. As shown in  Fig.3(a), the construction time of Triple code varies linearly with node size of XML trees. The influence of tree size on construction time of Triple Code is the least in three labeling schemes.

Fig. 3. Influence of tree size  Influence of tree size on storage cost. As shown in Fig.3(b), the storage costof Triple code has a little change with increase of nodes size. The influence of tree size on construction time of Triple Code is the least in three labeling schemes.

Influence of tree size on query performance. As shown in Fig.3(c-e), the query time (including AD, DO and LCA) of Triple code has a little change with increase of nodes size. The influence of tree size on query performances of Triple Code is the least in three labeling schemes.

D. Inuence of tree depth on Triple Code and iTriple Code Influence of tree depth on construction time. As shown in  Fig.4(a), the construction time of Triple code and iTriple Code has a little change with increase of depth size. The influence of         tree depth on construction time of Triple Code is the least in four labeling schemes. The influence of tree depth on construction time of iTriple Code is more than Branch Code and similar with Dewey Code.

Influence of tree depth on storage cost. As shown in Fig.4(b), the influence of tree depth on storage cost of Triple Code and ITriple Code is less than Dewey Code and Branch Code. The influence of tree depth on storage cost of Triple Code is the least.

Fig. 4. Influence of tree depth  Influence of tree depth on query performance. As shown in Fig.4(c-e), the influence of tree depth on query time of iTriple Code is the least in four labeling schemes. For AD and DO, the influence of tree depth on query time of Triple Code is less than Branch Code and similar with Dewey code. For LCA, the influence of tree depth on query performance of Triple Code is less than Branch Code and a little more than Dewey code.

In summary, Triple Code and iTriple Code have the much better performances on construction time and query performance than Branch Code and Dewey Code. Triple Code has the least storage cost in most XML data except for Univ and Nasa. For deep XML data, the query performances of iTriple Code are the best in four labeling schemes. Although its storage cost is high, it is worthy for its best performance on query time. The Influence of tree size on construction time, storage cost and query performance of Triple Code is less than Dewey Code and Branch Code. The Influence of tree depth on construction time and storage cost of Triple Code is the least in four labeling schemes. The Influence of tree depth on query performance of iTriple Code is the least in four labeling schemes.



VII. PERFORMANCE STUDY CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we proposed two new labeling schemes,  Triple Code and ITiple Code, which can support AD, PC, SR, DO and LCA efficiently. From experimental results, we can see they have better performances on construction time and query time than previous labeling schemes. For deep XML data, the query performances of iTriple Code are the best in four labeling schemes. Moreover, the influence of tree size on construction time, storage cost and query performances of Triple Code is less than Dewey Code and Branch Code. The influence of tree depth on construction time and query performances of iTriple Code is the least. Moreover, the two labeling schemes proposed by us are easy to be extended to support efficient updates of interval nodes and leaf nodes.
