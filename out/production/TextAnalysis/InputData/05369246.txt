Selection of Minimum Support degree with Rate of Frequent Items

Abstract?Association rules mining is an important branch of data mining research, which affords interesting relations between items of data sets. Minimum support degree is an important reference value in association rules mining and its threshold is usually given by user. The problem of how to determine the threshold when data mining is not researched until nowadays. So a selection mining support degree algorithm is put forwarded in this paper, and it has important significance in practical application.

I.  INTRODUCTION With the increasing popularity of computer application  and Internet, the conflict between abundance of data and lack of knowledge has become more prominent, data in the world is growing at an alarming rate. People in different fields are looking forward to obtain their answers from the data and transform them into knowledge. Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), is a data mining tool, which includes data collection, data cleaning, dimensionality reduction, rule induction, pattern recognition, data analysis and assessment, and visualization etc. KDD is a combination product of statistics, computer science, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, machine learning and other subjects, and is regarded not only as an important research topic in database system and machine learning by many researchers but also as an important domain which has tremendous return by many business people. The knowledge found from the database can be used in information management, decision support, process control and many other aspects. From small-scale research in 1980s to today's flourish, knowledge discovery has been occupied a place in business and scientific community. Thus it can be seen that data mining and knowledge discovery is a very active research field in recent years.

Association rules mining, which gives an interesting relationship between items of data sets, is an important research branch in data mining. Since Agrawal et al.[1] proposed the concept first in SIGMOD93, research on association rules has been a focus of many scholars.

Minimum support degree, a very important parameter in mining association rules, is specified as a threshold by the users. However, the problem of how to specify the threshold is not researched so far. Therefore, an algorithm for specifying minimum support degree is put forward in this paper, the algorithm is helpful for users to select the smallest  support degree in association rules mining. The next part of this paper is organized as follows: the proposed problem is described in section II, and the minimum support algorithm is proposed in section III; then the analysis and discussion of the proposed algorithm is performed in the last section.



II. THE PROPOSED PROBLEM Suppose I is a set with m different items, I={i1,i2,?,  im}, D is a transactions database, each transaction T in it includes a series of items in set I, namely T ? I, and TID is the only identifier of T.

Definition 1.If set X ? I, then X is called items set; if X includes k items, then X is called k_items set. Suppose X is items set, T is a transaction in database, if X ? T, then we say that T includes X or T supports X. The support number of set X in D, marked X.connt, is referred to the number of transaction which includes X; the support degree of set X in D, marked X.supD, is referred to the rate of transaction which includes X.

Definition 2.Suppose minsup is the minimum support degree threshold, X is items set. If X.sup minsup, then X is called frequent items set, and if X is k_items set, then it is called frequent k_items set. Especially, frequent 1_item set is called frequent item.

An association rule is an expression which possesses the form as X=>Y, where X ? I, Y ? I, X Y= . The conditions satisfying the form X=>Y are described as follows:  ? The expression possesses support degree minsup, namely:  support(X=>Y) = support(X?Y)= (X?Y).supD ,   (1) support(X=>Y)  minsup .                     (2)  ? The expression possesses confidence degree minconf, namely:  confidence(X=>Y)=support(X?Y)/ support  (X) ,(3) confidence(X=>Y)  minconf .              (4)  Where minsup is minimum support degree and minconf is minimum confidence degree. Minimum support degree is an important concept in data mining and no one has researched the problem of how to determine the value of it.



III. THE MINIMUM SUPPORT DEGREE ALGORITHM The main idea of the proposed algorithm is described as  follows: When data mining, the rate of frequent items to all items is specified as b by users first, then the minimum support degree threshold  is determined by the value b so  2009 Second International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design  DOI 10.1109/ISCID.2009.65   2009 Second International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design  DOI 10.1109/ISCID.2009.65     as to the rate of mined frequent items to all items is just b when the minimum support degree is . According to these, the algorithm for selecting minimum support degree is put forward.

1) Input:Items set I={i1,i2,?,im},transactions database D and the rate of frequent items to all items b  2) Output: minimum support degree threshold The algorithm is described as follows: 1) Step1:Scanning transactions database D once to  calculate support degree ik.supD of item ik.

2) Step2:low=0; high=1; =1/2; t=1; 3) Step3:While (t) do{  a)  Step3.1:Calculate the rate of frequent items to all items b  according to the minimum support degree threshold and support degree ik.supD of all items.

b)  Step3.2:if (abs(b?b )<0.0001) /* abs(x) denotes the absolute value of x*/  t=0; else if (b< b ) {  low= ; =(low+high)/2; }  else {  high= ; =(low+high)/2; }  4)  Step4: return( ).

The idea of half search algorithm is applied in the proposed algorithm. When the rate of frequent items to all items b  is greater than the value b specified by users, the threshold  should be adjusted greater, otherwise the value should be adjusted smaller. Furthermore, a method of approximate equivalent is adopted in step 3.2 of the proposed algorithm. When the absolute value of b?b  is less than 0.0001, we consider that the value of b is equal to the value b .



IV. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION Preceding the proposed algorithm, the usual method of  association rules mining is a mining course by a specified minimum support threshold. If the mining result is not expected, then the mining course is repeated by adjusting the threshold until the mining result attains user?s goal.

However, how to adjust the threshold brings about an intractable problem. Hence, the proposed algorithm is very significant in the application of association rules mining.

Nowadays, the typical algorithms for association rules mining are Apriori algorithm[1], FP_Growth algorithm[2] and many other improved algorithms[3-7]. The proposed algorithm in this paper can be applied in those referred algorithms and the scanning times of transactions database will not increase. In other words, when using the proposed algorithm in association rules mining, the workload is not added, but the efficiency is greatly improved.
