Mining Complete Fuzzy Frequent Itemsets by Tree

Abstract-In this paper, we attempt to extend the fuzzy FP-tree mining process to mine all fuzzy frequent itemsets, instead of only the representative linguistic terms, from a set of quantitative transactions. A multiple fuzzy-term FP (MFFP) tree with the consideration of fuzzy operations is proposed to help the execution of the fuzzy mining process. The corresponding MFFP? growth mining algorithm is also designed to derive all fuzzy frequent item sets from the tree structure by fuzzy operations.

Experimental results also show the performance of the proposed approach.

I. INTRODUCTION  In the past, many algorithms for mining association rules from transactions were proposed, and most of them were based on the Apriori algorithm [1], which used the level-wise approach to generate and test candidate itemsets recursively.

Han et al. then proposed the frequent-pattern (FP) tree structure for efficiently mining association rules without generation of candidate itemsets [5]. Their approach compressed a database into a tree structure which stored only frequent (also called large) items. The construction process was executed tuple by tuple, from the first transaction to the last one, to build the FP tree. After that, a recursive mining procedure called FP-growth was executed to derive frequent patterns from the FP-tree structure.

In these years, the fuzzy set theory [15] has been used more and more frequently in intelligent systems because of its simplicity and similarity to human reasoning [8]. For data mining, Hong et al. proposed a fuzzy mining algorithm for managing quantitative data based on the Apriori algorithm [6- 7]. Besides, Papadimitriou and Mavroudi proposed an approach based on the FP trees to fmd fuzzy association rules [13]. In their approach, only two fuzzy regions were used to construct the tree structure, and the fuzzy regions were evaluated in individual transactions, instead of in the whole database. Thus, a fuzzy region might not be frequent even if the summation of its fuzzy values in the whole database was larger than or equal    to the mmnnum count, which was the mmnnum support threshold multiplied by the number of all the transactions. Lin et al. then proposed the fuzzy FP-tree algorithm [11] to construct a tree structure and mine fuzzy association rules from it. In that approach, each item used only the linguistic term with the maximum cardinality in later mining processes. The frequent fuzzy itemsets derived in this way were, however, incomplete since some frequent fuzzy l-itemsets were not used.

In this paper, we thus attempt to extend the FP-tree mining process to mine complete fuzzy frequent itemsets from a set of quantitative transactions. The proposed approach is a little more complex than the original FP-tree mining in which each item has only one representative fuzzy region (term). A multiple fuzzy-term FP (MFFP) tree with the consideration of fuzzy operations is thus proposed for helping the execution of the mining process. The MFFP tree keeps all the fuzzy frequent regions derived from a database no matter whether they are generated from the same items or not. The corresponding MFFP-growth mining algorithm is also designed to derive the fuzzy frequent itemsets from the tree structure by fuzzy operations.



II. REVIEW OF RELATED WORKS  In this section, some related researches are briefly reviewed.

They are the FP-tree algorithm and mining association rules from quantitative data.

A. The FP-tree Mining Algorithm Han et al. proposed the Frequent-Pattern (FP) tree structure  for efficiently mining association rules without generation of candidate itemsets [5]. The FP-tree mining algorithm consists of two phases. The frrst phase focuses on constructing the FP? tree from a database, and the second phase focuses on deriving frequent patterns from the FP-tree. Three steps are involved in FP-tree construction. The database is first scanned to find all items with their counts. The items with their supports equal to or larger than a predefined minimum support are selected as frequent l-itemsets (items). Next, the frequent items are sorted in their descending frequencies. At last, the database is scanned    again to construct the FP tree according to the sorted order of frequent items. The construction process is executed tuple by tuple, from the first transaction to the last one. After all transactions are processed, the FP tree is completely constructed.

After the FP tree is constructed from a database, a mining procedure called FP-growth [5] is executed to find all frequent itemsets. The FP-growth does not need to generate candidate itemsets for mining, but derives frequent patterns directly from the FP tree. A conditional FP tree is generated for each frequent item, and from the tree the frequent itemsets with the processed item can be recursively derived.

Several other algorithms based on the FP-tree structure have been proposed as well [4, 10]. Some related researches are still in progress.

B. Mining Algorithms for Fuzzy Association Rules Several fuzzy mining approaches have thus been proposed  to find interesting linguistic association rules or sequential patterns from transaction data with quantitative values. For example, Chan et al. proposed an F-APACS algorithm to mine fuzzy association rules [2]. Kuok et al. proposed a fuzzy mining approach to handle numerical data in databases and to derive fuzzy association rules [9]. At nearly the same time, Hong et al. proposed a fuzzy mining algorithm to mine fuzzy rules from quantitative transaction data [6-7]. Papadimitriou and Mavroudi proposed an approach based on FP-trees to find fuzzy association rules [13]. In their approach, each item in the transactions was transferred into only two fuzzy regions with individual fuzzy values. Only the local fuzzy frequent 1- itemsets kept in each transaction were used for mining. Besides, it did not use any fuzzy operation to combine fuzzy regions together, which made the mined fuzzy rules a little hard to understand.

Lin et al. then proposed the fuzzy FP tree to derive the fuzzy frequent itemsets from a quantitative dataset [11]. It used the fuzzy region with the maximum cardinality among all the transformed fuzzy regions of an item to construct a fuzzy FP tree. Besides, fuzzy operations were used in forming itemsets with more than one fuzzy region. Some other methods for finding fuzzy association rules have also been proposed [3, 14], and some related researches are still in progress.



III. THE PROPOSED MFFP-1REE CONSTRUCTION ALGORITHM  The proposed construction algorithm for building an MFFP tree from a quantitative database is described in this section.

A. The Tree Construction Algorithm The proposed multiple fuzzy-term FP (MFFP) tree mining  algorithm integrates the fuzzy-set concepts and the FP-tree-like approach to fmd fuzzy frequent itemsets from quantitative transaction data. It consists of two sub-algorithms. The first one, the MFFP-tree construction algorithm, is stated below.

The MFFP-tree construction algorithm: INPUT: A quantitative database consisting of n transactions, a   set of membership functions, and a predefined minimum support threshold s.

OUTPUT: A multiple fuzzy-term FP (MFFP) tree.

STEP 1: Transform the quantitative value vi} of each item ? in  the i-th transaction into a fuzzy set fij represented as (fij]IRj] + fijiRj2 + ... + fijJRjh) using the given membership functions, where h is the number of fuzzy regions for ?, Rjl is the I-th fuzzy region of ?, 1 ? I ? h , and fiji is vi}'s fuzzy membership value in region Rjl.

STEP 2: Calculate the scalar cardinality of each fuzzy region Rjl in the transaction data as:  n  countjl = L.!;j/.

;=1  STEP 3: Check whether the value countjl of the fuzzy region Rjl is larger than or equal to the predefined minimum count n* s. If the count of a fuzzy region Rjl is equal to or greater than the minimum count, put the fuzzy region in the set of fuzzy frequent regions (L]). That is:  L] = {Rjll countj/?n*s, 1 ?j? m}.

STEP 4: Build the Header_Table by keeping the fuzzy frequent regions in L] in the descending order of counts.

STEP 5: Remove the fuzzy regions of the items not in L] from the transactions of the transformed database.

STEP 6: Sort the remaining fuzzy frequent regions in each transaction by their membership values in a descending order.

STEP 7: Initially set the root node of the multiple fuzzy-term FP tree as {root}.

STEP 8: Insert the transactions in the transformed database into the MFFP tree tuple by tuple. The following two cases may exist.

Substep 8-1: If a fuzzy region Rjl in a transaction has been at the corresponding branch of the MFFP tree for the transaction, add the membership value of Rjl in the transaction to the node of Rjl in the branch.

Substep 8-2: Otherwise, add a node of RjI at the end of the corresponding branch, set the count of the node as the membership value of RjI, and insert a link from the node of Rjl in the last branch to the current node. If there is not such a branch with the node of Rjl, insert a link from the entry of RjI in the Header? Table to the added node.

In STEP 8, a corresponding branch is the branch generated from a transformed transaction according to the descending    order of the membership values of the fuzzy regions in it. After STEP 8, the fmal MFFP tree is constructed.

B. An Example In this section, an example is given to illustrate how to  construct an MFFP tree from the quantitative transaction data.

Assume the quantitative transaction database shown in Table I is used as the example. It consists of 6 transactions and 5 items, denoted A to E.

TABLE !. SIX QUANTITATIVE TRANSACTIONS IN THE EXAMPLE  TID Items 1 (A :5) (C: 10) (D:2) (?:9) 2 (A:8) (B:2) (C:3) 3 (B:3) (C:9) 4 (A:7) (C:9) (D:3) 5 (A:5) (B:2) (C:5) 6 (A:3) (C:lO) (D:2) (?:2)  Assume the fuzzy membership functions are the same for all the items and are shown in Figure 1. Thus, three fuzzy membership values Low, Middle and High are produced for each item in a transaction according to the predefmed membership functions. Note that the proposed approach also works when the membership functions of the items are not the same.

Low Middle 8'gb  II Amount  Figure I. The membership functions used in this example  The quantitative values of the items in the transactions are then represented as fuzzy sets. Take the first item in the first transaction as an example. In that transaction, the amount "5" of A is converted into the fuzzy set (O.2/A.Low, 0.8/A.Middle) using the given membership functions in Figure 1. The scalar cardinality of each fuzzy region in the transaction is then calculated as the count value. The results are shown in Table II.

The results are shown in Table III.

THE SET OF Fuzzy FREQUENT REGIONS IN THE EXAMPLE  Fuzzy frequent regions Count A.Middle 3.4  B.Low 2.2 C.Middle 2.4 C.High 2.8 D.Low 2.2  The fuzzy frequent regions in Table III are then sorted in the descending order of their counts and are put into the Header_Table. The fuzzy regions which are not in Table III are removed from each transaction. The remaining fuzzy regions in each transaction are then sorted according to their membership values in a descending order. After this step, the updated transactions with only the sorted fuzzy frequent regions (1- itemsets) are shown in Table IV.

The updated transactions in Table IV are inserted into the MFFP tree tuple by tuple. After all the six transactions are processed, the resulting Header Table and MFFP tree are shown in Figure 2.

IV. THE PROPOSED MFFP-GROWTH MINING ALGORITHM  After the MFFP tree is constructed, the fuzzy frequent itemsets with more than one fuzzy region can then be found by the proposed multiple MFFP-growth mining approach, which is described below.

A. The Mining Algorithm The fuzzy frequent items (fuzzy regions) in Header_Table  in Figure 2 are processed one by one and bottom-up to form the fuzzy frequent itemsets. The fuzzy frequent itemsets can be derived from the nodes by the intersection operation (which is the minimum function here) in fuzzy sets. The mining algorithm is stated as follows:  The MFFP-growth mining algorithm: INPUT: The MFFP tree, its corresponding Header_Table, and  the predefmed minimum count.

OUTPUT: The fuzzy frequent Itemsets.

STEP 1: Process the fuzzy regions (fuzzy frequent items) in  the Header_Table one-by-one and bottom-up by the following steps. Let the currently processed fuzzy region be RjI.

STEP 2: Find all the nodes with the fuzzy region RjI in the MFFP tree through the links.

STEP 3: Extract the nodes in the same path of the currently processed node for the fuzzy region RjI to form the conditional fuzzy patterns except no two nodes belong to the same ?. The minimum operation is performed on the path to get the fuzzy values of the derived fuzzy itemsets.

STEP 4: Sum the fuzzy values of the same derived fuzzy itemsets together.

STEP 5: Check whether the summed fuzzy value of each derived fuzzy itemset is larger than or equal to the minimum count. If yes, output it as a fuzzy frequent itemset.

STEP 6: Recursively do STEPs 3 to 5 to build deeper conditional fuzzy patterns and derive the fuzzy itemsets which are related to the currently processed fuzzy region RjI.

STEP 7: Repeat STEPs 2 to 6 for another fuzzy region until all the fuzzy regions in the Header_Table are processed.

After STEP 7, all the fuzzy frequent itemsets can be derived from the MFFP tree. Below, an example is given to illustrate the algorithm.

B. An Example For the constructed MFFP tree in Figure 2, the proposed  MFFP-growth mining algorithm fmds the fuzzy frequent itemsets as follows.

The fuzzy regions in Header_Table are processed one-by? one and bottom-up. Take the fuzzy region CMiddle as an   example to show the next steps. The nodes with the currently processed fuzzy region CMiddle in the MFFP tree are then found. There are totally five nodes of CMiddle in the example.

The nodes in the same paths with these five nodes are then found to derive the fuzzy itemsets.

In the first branch, the generated fuzzy itemsets are {(A. Middle, CMiddle): 2.4(10.6 = 0.6}, {(D.Low, CMiddle): 1.4 (1 0.6 = 0.6}, and {(A. Middle, CMiddle, D.Low): 2.4 (11.4 (10.6 = 0.6}, respectively. The other branches in the MFFP tree are processed in the same way. The above steps are repeated for another fuzzy region until all the fuzzy regions in the Header_Table are processed. The counts of the generated fuzzy itemsets are then examined against the updated minimum count, which is 1.8. The fmal results of the fuzzy frequent itemsets are then shown in Table V.

V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  The experiments were performed on a real dataset called FOODMART from an anonymous chain store [12]. Two and three membership functions for each item were tested, respectively. Figure 3 shows the execution time for the proposed MFFP tree mining algorithm with two and three fuzzy regions for each item. The minimum support threshold was set at from 21 % to 25%, with 1 % increment each time.

VI. CONCLUSION  In this paper, the MFFP-tree structure is proposed to efficiently and effectively handle the mining from the quantitative data. Compared to the previous approach, the proposed one considers multiple fuzzy frequent regions for an item, thus being able to derive a complete set of fuzzy itemsets and association rules. The MFFP-growth mining algorithm is also proposed to efficiently mine the fuzzy frequent itemsets from the MFFP tree. Experimental results have also shown the performance of the proposed algorithm under different parameter values.
