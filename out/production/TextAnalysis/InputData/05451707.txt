Abstract? In this paper, we present an algorithm of mining hybrid dimension association rules which satisfies the definite condition on the basis of multidimensional transaction database.  Boolean Matrix based approach has been employed to generate frequent itemsets in multidimensional transaction databases. It adopts Boolean relational calculus to discover frequent predicate sets. When using this algorithm first time, it scans the database once and will generate the association rules.

Apriori property is used in algorithm to prune the item sets. It is not necessary to scan the database again; it uses Boolean logical operations to generate the association rules. We illustrate the implementation of algorithm with the help of a simple example.

Keywords- Boolean matrix; hybrid dimensional association rule; relational calculus; multidimensional transaction  database.



I. INTRODUCTION Mining association rules in transactional or relational  database is an important task in data mining [5]. The association rules are for discovering the interesting association relationships among huge amounts of business transaction records. An association rule is an implication of the form A? B, where A ? I , B ? I , and A ?B= ? . The rule A? B holds in the transaction set D, with support s, where s is the percentage of transactions in D that contain A ? B (i.e., the union of sets A and B, or say, both A and B). This is taken to be the probability, P(A ?B).The rule A ? B has confidence c in the transaction set D, where c is the percentage of transactions in D containing A that also contain B. This is taken to be the conditional probability, P(B|A). That is, )()( BAPBASupport ?=?  )|()( ABPBAConfidence =? Rules that satisfy both a minimum support threshold (min sup) and a minimum confidence threshold (min conf) are called strong. The support defined in the equation given below is referred to relative support, whereas the occurrence frequency is called the absolute support[4]. The set of frequent k-itemsets is commonly denoted by LK.

)( )()|()(  ASupport BASupportABPBAConfidence ?==?  Association rule mining can be viewed as a two-step process:  1. Find all frequent itemsets: Each of these itemsets will occur at least as frequently as a predetermined minimum support count, min sup.

2. Generate strong association rules from the frequent itemsets: These rules must satisfy minimum support and minimum confidence, min_conf.

Among them searching for frequent itemsets is the key step.

Because it?s easy to generate rules from frequent itemsets, R. Agrawal [1] and some others [10][3] presented the algorithm for mining the simplest form of association rules.

The  Apriori algorithm proposed by R. Agrawal and R.

Srikant [2]. Apriori employs an iterative approach known as a level-wise search, where k-itemsets are used toexplore (k+1)-itemsets. Apriori principle: If an itemset is requent, then all of its subsets must also be frequent. It works in two steps-  Join Step:    Ck is generated by joining Lk-1with itself.

Prune Step: Any (k-1)-itemset that is not frequent cannot be a subset of a frequent k-itemset. (Ck: Candidate itemset of size k and Lk : frequent itemset of size k)  Moreover, it is necessary to repeatedly scan the database for finding frequent itemsets. Therefore the run-time of the Apriori will increase by index grade with the increase of transaction item quantity.

Association rules can be classified as single-dimensional  association rules and multidimensional association rules on the basis of dimension appearing in rules. In multi- dimensional databases, we refer to each distinct predicate in a rule as a dimension. Hence, we can refer to buys (X, ?Digital camera?) ? buys (X, ?HP Printer?) is a single dimensional or intra-dimensional association rule because it contains a single distinct predicate (e.g., buys) with multiple occurrences (i.e., the predicate occurs more than once within the rule). Association rules that involve two or more dimensions or predicates can be referred to as multidimensional association rules, age(X , "20" ) ? occupation (X , "student" ) ? buys (X , "laptop" ), contains three predicates (age, occupation, and buys), each of which occurs only once in the rule. Hence, we say that it has no repeated predicates [12]. Multidimensional association rules with no repeated predicates are called inter-dimensional association rules. We can also mine multi- dimensional association rules with repeated predicates, which contain multiple occurrences of some predicates.

These rules are called hybrid-dimensional association rules.

Volumn 2  978-1-4244-5586-7/10/$26.00      2010 IEEEC     In this the mining of single-dimensional association rule and non-repetitive predicate multi-dimensional association rule are integrated. We propose an algorithm for mining of hybrid-dimensional association rule using Boolean matrix.

It mines hybrid-dimension association rules from multi- dimensional transaction database. We  set definite condition that restricts to the hybrid-dimension association rules mined.

When we design the hybrid dimension association rule mining algorithm, we stress on the extension and improvement of the Apriori Algorithm the simple Single-dimensional mining algorithm. Therefore, the following text will give a brief analysis to the Apriori

II. THE APRIORI ALGORITHM The classical Apriori algorithm [1] employ an iterative  method to find all the frequent iemsets. First, the frequent 1- itemsets L1 is found according to the user-specified minimum support threshold, then the L1 is used to find frequent 2-iemsets L2, and so on, until there is no new frequent itemsets could be found. After finding all the frequent itemsets using Apriori, we could generate the corresponding association rules, according to the second step in the process of association rules mining.

Thus we find the association relationships among transaction items [10].

The conditional restrict is: in the rules, the predicates represent the main attribute (the attribute refers to the transaction itemset) can occur many times, but the other predications refer to subordinate attributes (some other relevant attributes) can only occur once [6]. Therefore, to achieve our aim, we design an algorithm for mining hybrid-dimension association rules, which meet the definite condition, from multidimensional transaction database.



III. CONDITIONAL HYBRID-DIMENSION ASSOCIATION RULES MINING  The generation of frequent itemsets is the core of all the association rules mining algorithms. Previous studies on mining multi-dimensional association rules we focused on finding non-repetitive predicate multi- dimensional rules.

We integrate the single-dimensional mining and non- repetitive predicate multi-dimensional mining, and present a method for mining hybrid-dimensional association rules using Boolean Matrix.

A. The join process  There are two steps in generation of the frequent itemsets and frequent predicate sets. The two steps are joining and pruning.

(1) The join generating candidate 2-itemsets C2 ; We find frequent 1-itemsest based on each attribute, at the same time we mark items belong to every main attribute.

So it will be clear that the marked items are the items of main attribute and unmarked items are the subordinate items.

When we search for C2, if both of the two joining items are marked items, we call the function for intra-dimensional join between the items as well as inter-dimensional join, but only proceed with inter-dimensional join on the other occasions.

(2) The join on other occasions  When we generate frequent itemsets directly according to the join mode of the Apriori, it would occur intradimensional join as well as inter-dimensional join. But there are some restrictions to the generation of intra- dimensional join and inter-dimensional join. Therefore we make the following modifications to the joining step of the Apriori.

We assume that items within transaction and itemset are sorted in lexicographic order. We could take two steps to find Lk ? Distinguish the intra-dimensional join and inter-  dimensional join; If all the items within the two (k-1)- itemsets  belong to the main attribute; we proceed with intra-dimensional join, and proceed with inter- dimensional join on other occasions.

? Implement join L k -1 ??  L k -1  , and choose the corresponding  joining condition according to the characteristic of the join (intra-dimensional join or inter-dimensional join) [6].

B. The conditional restriction in hybrid-dimension association rules  First the frequent itemsets are obtained, and then we generate the hybrid-dimension association rules from the frequent itemsets. In the process of generating frequent itemsets, we make both intra-dimensional join and inter-dimensional join, as well as the conditional restrictions while proceeding with join, all of the frequent itemsets have such a character: the values within main attribute field occur many times, while the values within subordinate attribute fields occur only once. Thus, the  rules generated by the algorithm may include many predicates, or include the same predicate. So the hybrid dimension association rules are formed.



IV. DEFINITIONS  A. Association Rules Definition 1: Let I = {i1 , i2, i3,??. in} be a set of items. D is a database of transactions.  Each transaction T is a set of items and has an identifier called TID. Each T ? I. [9] Definition 2: Association rule is the implication of the form A ?B, where A and B are itemsets which satisfies A ? I , B ? I and A ?  B = ? .

Definitio 3: The strength of an association rule can be measured in terms of its Support and Confidence.

A ?B is true in D with a support (denoted by sup and a confidence denoted by conf where A and B are  set of items. Support sup is a percentage of transactions including both A and B A ? B in transaction sets D Confidence conf is a percentage of transactions including both A and A ? B  in transactions that contain A sup P A ? B conf P B?A ? P A ? B Definition 4 Boolean Matrix: is a matrix with element ?0? or ?1?.

Definition 5 The Boolean AND operation is defined as follows:      0.0=0    0.1=0   1.0=0 1.1=1. Where logical  Volumn 2     implication is denoted by ?.? or AND. If we write C=A.B, then C can be determined by listing all possible combinations of A and B. Truth  table for AND will be:  A B C=A.B 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1  Definition 6 The Boolean ?AND calculus? is carried out to an arbitrary k columns vector of the Boolean matrix; the sum of ?1? of the operation result is called k- support of the k columns vector.

Proposition 1: If the sum of ?1? in a column vector Ai is less than min_sup_num, it is not necessary that Ai will attend calculus of the next level supports.

Rationale: According to the principle of the Boolean AND calculus, the result is ?1? when the value of all vector elements (in a record) is ?1? [7].

Proposition 2: Itemset A is a k-itemsets (each item belongs to different dimension/attribute); |LK-1(j)| presents the number of values in a dimension/attribute ?j? in all frequent (k-1)-itemsets of the frequent set LK-1. There is an item j in

X. If  |LK-1(j)| is smaller than k-1, itemset X is not a frequent itemset [7].



V. METHOD Let D is a multi-dimensional transactional database  m n  and min_sup is the minimum support of D. The minimum support number min_sup_num can be defined as: min_sup_num= min_sup ?m [8].

Dimensions, which are also called predications, attributes or fields, constitute a dimension combination with a formula d d dn in which dj represents j  dimension.

The i record can be expressed as value combination with a formula vi vi vin  where vij represents j-th value in i-th record, ?  i ? m ?  j ?  n The form dj vij is called an ?item? in relational database or other  multidimensional data sets, which is denoted by Iij That is: Iij dj vij  where ?  i ? m ?  j ?  n Among the n attributes, (n-1) attributes are subordinate attributes and  attribute is the main attribute.

A set constituted by some ?item? Iij is called ?itemset?. The ?itemset? which may consist of the items from subordinate attributes or main attribute only or from subordinate and main attributes.

The Boolean AND operation is carried out to an arbitrary n column vector of the Boolean matrix; the sum of 1?s of the operation result is called n-support of the n column vector[8].



VI. ALGORITHM The algorithm consists of following steps:  1. Transforming the multidimensional transaction database into two Boolean matrices one for subordinate attributes (Am*p) and one for main attribute (Am*q).

2. Generating the set of frequent 1-itemset LA1 (from the subordinate attributes matrix) and LB1 (from the main attribute matrix).

3. Pruning the Boolean matrices.

4. Perform AND operations to generate 2-itemsets:  LA1 ??   LB1 and LA1  ??  LA1    for inter-dimension join and LB1 ??   LB1  for intra-dimension join.

5. Repeat the process to generate (k+1)-itemsets from Lk.

A. Transforming the multidimensional transaction database into Boolean matrix  The multidimensional transaction database D has m records and n dimensions. Each dimension has different value combinations or categories. To extract such patterns from the database, the categorical and symmetric binary attributes are transformed into ?items? [8]. This type of transformation can be performed by creating a new item for each distinct attribute-value pair. Then association rule mining algorithm can be applied. If there are k value combinations in a dimension then k(k-1)/2 binary items will be created.

We set up separate Boolean matrix for subordinate attributes and main attribute. A Boolean matrix Am*p which has m (records or transactions) rows and p (for (n-1) subordinate attributes values) columns and another Boolean matrix Bm*q which has m (records or transactions) rows and q (for (nth) main attributes values) columns. For each transaction in subordinate attributes matrix, only one category of each dimension contains the value 1, rest will contain 0. Whereas in main attribute matrix there can be more than one category have value 1 in a transaction.

B.  Generating the frequent 1-itemset L1  The Boolean matrices Am*p and Bm*q  are scanned and support numbers of all dimension values are computed. The Support number  =  Ij * Sup_num,  of Ij ,  is the number of ?1s? in the jth column of the Boolean matrix. If Ij *sup_num is smaller than min_sup_num, itemset { Ij } is not a frequent 1-itemset and the jth column will be deleted from the matrix .

Otherwise itemset { Ij } is the frequent 1-itemset and is added to frequent one itemset list L1.

C.  Pruning the Boolean matrix Pruning the Boolean matrix means deleting some columns from it. This is described in detail as: Let I? be the set of all items in the frequent set   LK-1, where k>2.

Compute all     |LK-1(j)| where j?I?, and delete the column of correspondence item j if |LK-1(j)| is smaller than min_sup_num.

D. Generating the set of frequent k-itemsets Lk Frequent k-itemsets are discovered by AND relational calculus, which is carried out for the k-vectors combination.

If the Boolean matrix Ap*q  has q columns where 2< ?n and min_sup_num is h?p?m, (Cq )k, combinations of k-vectors will be produced. The AND relational calculus is for each  Volumn 2     combination of k-vectors. If the sum of element?s values in the ?AND? calculation result is not smaller than the minimum support number min_sup_num, the k-itemsets corresponding to this combination of k-vectors are the frequent k-itemsets and are added to the set of frequent k- itemsets Lk. The rules generated from the algorithm may include many predicates, or include the same predicate. So the hybrid dimension association rules are formed.



VII.  ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE We integrate the single-dimensional mining and non-  repetitive predicate multi-dimensional mining, and present a method for mining hybrid- dimensional association rules using Boolean Matrix.

Let a multi-dimensional transaction database Order, which includes two subordinate attributes Age and Income and one main attribute Ordered_items as given below.

TABLE II. ORDER               In order to simplify the implement process, we preprocessed some attributes before algorithm executes, shown below: TABLE III. Mapping Age           TABLE IV. Mapping Income    TABLE V.  ORDER              The multidimensional transaction table Order is transformed into two Boolean Matrices: Am*p   as subordinate attributes matrix and Bm*q  as main attribute matrix. Which are as given below:  Let the minimum support is 0.4; m=10 is the number of transactions. Therefore min_sup_num=10 ? 0.4=4.0. We compute the sum of the elements value of each column in the Boolean matrix A10*5 and B10*5 set of frequent 1-itemset is :    LA1 = {{y},{m},{h},{l}},  LB1 ={ {I1},{I2},{I3},{I5}}  smaller than the minimum support number. Now we  perform the ?AND? operation to join LA1 and LB1 (according to the type of join) to generate L2.

The possible 2-itemsets  are: Inter-dimensional join (LA1??   LB1 and LA1  ??  LA1):  It is performed by AND operation among the columns of Matrix Am*p AND Bm*q  and Am*p AND Am*p.

Intra-dimensional join (LB1?? LB1):   It is performed by AND operation among the columns of Matrix Bm*p AND Bm*q. The possible 2-itemsets from LA1 and LB1 are: (y,l), (m,h), (h,1), (h,2),(h,3),(h,5), (l,1),(l,2), (l,3),(l,5),(y,1), (y,2),(y,3),(y,5), (m,1),(m,2),(m,3),(m,5), (I1,I2),(I1,I3),(I1,I5),(I2,I3),(I2,I5),(I3,I5).

After performing   ?AND?  operation to get the support numbers of these mentioned item sets the Boolean matrices A10*18 and B10*6 are generated.

Now again we compute the sum of the columns of matrices A10*18  and B10*6. And prune the columns of the 2-itemsets those are not frequent. Same process will be repeated till for next higher itemsets. Figure 1. shows the process of searching for frequent itemsets in detail. In the figure, we pruned the candidates generated in each level. For each generated frequent itemset, we find that it should meet the characteristics of the frequent itemsets that are generated by hybrid-dimension association rules mining algorithm.

Therefore, we can easily generate corresponding hybrid- dimension association rules from the frequent itemsets generated by the algorithm. For example:  In figure 8, {m, h, I1, I2:4} is a frequent itemset. We can generate such a hybrid-dimension association rule: 21 IIhm ??? (Support=40% and Confidence=100%)   Figure 1. The process  of searching for frequent itemsets.

Obviously, in this rule the subordinate attributes Age and Income appear at most once, and the main attribute Ordered_items appears many times, which meets our restriction.This further testifies that it is feasible to mine  ID Age  Income  Ordered_items 1 31..40 6780 I1, I2, I5 2 31..40 7800 I1, I2 3 31..40 9500 I1,I2,I5 4 21..30 4850 I2, I4 5 41..30 7700 I1, I3 6 31..40 8650 I1, I2, I4 7 31..50 3500 I1, I3, I5 8 21..30 4600 I2, I5 9 21..30 3950 I1, I2, I3 10 21..40 5400 I3, I4  Interval Name  4000-6000 l  6000-10,000 h  Interval Name  21..30 y  31..40 m  41..50 s  ID Age  Income  Ordered_items 1 M H I1, I2, I5 2 M H I1, I2 3 M H I1,I2,I5 4 Y L I2, I4 5 S H I1, I3 6 M H I1, I2, I4 7 M L I1, I3, I5 8 Y L I2, I5 9 Y L I1, I2, I3 10 Y L I3, I4  A10*4 Age        Income   ? ?   y         m        h        l  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?

VIII.  EXPERIMENT To test whether the proposed method is fast, expansible  and effective our experiments are made on machine with Intel(R) Core 2Duo, 1.5GHz and 1GB memory. The operating system is Windows XP. We use a database that has 500 records and 5 attributes, which have 2~8 different values/categories.

IX.    RESULT AND DISCUSSION  The confidence of association rules has a specific meaning: when the antecedent of the rule is satisfied, the consequent of the rule will have c% (here c refers to the confidence of the rule) possibility of being satisfied. In association rules, only in the antecedent part of multidimensional association rules include several predictions at the same time. We can say that the result of prediction on multidimensional association rules is better and more precise than on single- dimensional association rules. For example, TABLEI presents a multidimensional transaction database Order. If we make a single dimensional association analysis on the predicate Ordered_items, which presents itemsets in transaction, the result of analysis will only include the relevance of Order itemsets. But, if we make a hybrid- dimension association analysis, the result of analyzing not only includes the relevance of Order itemsets, but also includes the relevance of customers? information, eg: Age, Income. Thus when we proceed with predictions on the product order of customers? by means of the result of association analysis, obviously, the conditions included in the antecedent of multidimensional association rules is more abundant, and will bring better prediction result.



X.   CONCLUSION The proposed algorithm uses Boolean matrix and meet the definite condition to generate conditional-hybrid dimensional association rules, from multidimensional transactional database. The main features are: it scans the database only once, it does not generate the candidate item sets, and it uses the Boolean vector ?relational calculus? to generate frequent item sets. It stores data in the form of bits, so it needs less memory space and can be applied to large relational databases. The further work is to optimize the algorithm, and increase the efficiency of the algorithm.
