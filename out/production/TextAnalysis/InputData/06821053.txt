I. INTRODUCTION  In the recent years, Microblogging service has become an important social media for creating, sharing, or exchanging information and ideas. As for the Microblogging service platforms, the most popular are Twitter, Chinese Weibo, etc. These platforms allow user (i.e.

Microblogger) to publish short messages (also called microposts) up to 140 characters to share with others what is happening, what is interesting, as well as their feelings and opinions. For instance, when someone posts one micropost about the opinion of Iphone 5C in Sina Weibo platform, the readers of this micropost can interact with the Microblogger by writing comment, recommending to other Microbloggers by ?@?, or marking as positive. Through the interactions sharing opinion about Iphone 5C between the Microblogger and its readers, Microblogger could influence the shopping activities of readers who may be latent customers of Iphone 5C. Therefore, the way in which people influence each other through their interactions is a   DOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.73    DOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.73     powerful but subtle process that is pervasive in Microblogging service. Social influence analysis in social media often refers to verifying the existence of social influence [1] or measuring the strength of direct and indirect influence between different users [2]. It is often exploited for different tasks such as businesses intelligence [1,5], information retrieval [2,3,10,12], recommendations [4,7,8,11,14,16], and opinion mining [6,9,13,15].

Consequently, there is a clear need for methods and techniques to mine social influence between Microbloggers with the emergence and rapid proliferation of Microblogs.

There has been some theoretical and empirical work on quantifying the strength of social influence in social media.

Typically, social influence study for estimating model on social media can be categorized into roughly two types. The first is graph-based model, where the strength of social influence is learned from graph model which incorporates node information and interaction information. Tang et al. [7] focused on measuring the strength of topic-level social influence quantitatively. They presented Topical Affinity Propagation (TAP) to model the topic-level social influence on large networks, and then developed an efficient distributed learning algorithm for TAP based on the Map-Reduce framework in order to scale to real large networks. Agarwal et al. [8] performed personalized recommendation based a factor model that incorporates rater-comment and rater-author interactions simultaneously in a principled way. Cai et al. [9] focused on influence persona discovery and put forward an opinion-oriented link analysis model social influence analysis, wherein three kinds of influence persona are discovered. Yang et al. [10] examined the problem of predicting signed social ties and presented a Behavior Relation Interplay model that inferred signed ties by capturing the interplay between social relations and users? behavior of decision making. Tan et al.

[11] demonstrated that user-level sentiment analysis can be significantly improved by incorporating link information from a social network. They showed that using graphical models incorporating social network information could lead to statistically significant improvements in user-level sentiment polarity classification with respect to an approach using only textual information. The second is matrix / tensor factorization approach, which means that matrix / tensor is constructed to hold interaction information between Microblogger and its readers, and then matrix /  tensor factorization is employed to quantify social influences. Hu et al. [12] studied the problem of comments-oriented document summarization by considering not only its content, but also the comments left by its readers. This work identified three relations (namely, topic, quotation, and mention) by which comments can be linked to one another, modeled the relations in a 3rd-order tensor, and scored the importance of each comment by HOSVD and PARAFAC factorization. Chen et al. [13] focused on user reputation in a comment rating environment and estimated user reputation by a novel bias-smoothed tensor model which combined two types of reputation scores in a web system, external scores and internal scores.

Sun et al. [14] examined the problem of personalized web search and improved web search by  a novel CubeSVD approach where the clickthrough data was represented by a 3-order tensor (users, queries and Web pages),and the higher-order singular value decomposition technique was carried out to automatically capture the latent factors that govern the relations among these multi-type objects. Shi et al. [15] framed top-N context-aware recommendation as a ranking problem in collaborative Filtering and proposed TFMAP model using tensor factorization to model implicit feedback data (e.g. purchases, clicks) with contextual information. Ma et al. [16] tackled the problem of social recommendation and presented a novel social recommendation framework fusing a user-item rating matrix with the user?s social network using probabilistic matrix factorization. However, most these existing methods mostly rely on social links between users, failing to take advantage of significant characteristics of Microblogging.

Furthermore, Microblogging?s user size is very large, which make computing resource for social influence mining approach can?t be satisfied by single computer. On the other hand, with the exponential growth of data in the amount of user-generated data, the Map-Reduce paradigm is employed to deal with data mining applications based on large-scale dataset, which provide good experience for tackling the huge volume of Microblogging dataset [17, 18].

In this paper, a tensor factorization framework based on cloud computing platform is put forward to estimate the strength of social influence in Microblogging. The framework has three components: a feature extraction component, a tensor factorization component and a user influence ranking component. In feature extraction     component, features are extracted for capturing user social influence quantitatively through statistical analysis on the Microbloggers? relations. In tensor factorization component, tensor factorization based MapReduce model is presented to infer user?s implicit user?s relations. Finally, a user influence ranking function is constructed for computing user social influence in user influence ranking component.

Moreover, the prediction accuracy and scalability of the proposed approach is experimentally evaluated by comparing with two baseline methods using Sina Weibo dataset (Chinese Microblogging platform). In summary, the contributions of this paper are follows:  1 The feature extraction on Microbloggers? relations in Microblogging platform is experimentally carried out for capturing user social influence quantitatively through statistical analysis.

2 The proposed approach bases on Tensor factorization method which automatically estimates the latent factors that govern the Microbloggers? relations for the strength of social influence.

3 The tensor factorization framework is developed on the Map-Reduce programming model in order to scale up the approach for tackling the huge volume of Microblogging dataset.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the features of Microblogging service are analyzed quantitatively for capturing user social influence, and then a tensor factorization framework is put forward for mining social influence. Section III presents evaluation methodology and describes the experimental results in detail. Finally, our conclusion is summarized in Section IV.



II. MODEL FRAMEWORK  A. Formulation We are given a Microblogging service platform M ,  which consists of a set of Microbloggers U . Each  Microblogger Uui ?  in M  publishes a set of posts  uP  and is interacted with other Microblogger Uu j ?  which leads to a set of relations R  (such as, ?forward?, ?follow?, ?Thumb-up?, et al.).  Our goal is to estimate the strength of each Microblogger u ?s social influence in  platform M  based on its posts uP  and its relations uR  caused by its interactions with other Microbloggers, and then rank Mircoblogger u  according to its social influence score.

B. Tensor-based Approach Social influence could be inferred by automatically  capturing the latent factors that govern the relations between users in social media. In this section, a tensor-based approach is proposed to predict the strength of social influence using tensor factorization. For blogger media , according to [19], influential bloggers are not necessarily active bloggers, and a blogger can be considered influential if s/he has at least one influential blog post which is be approximated by four properties: recognition, activity generation, novelty and eloquence.

However, a microblog differs from a traditional blog in that its content is typically short snippets of text that provide any other content that can fit into 140 characters and the linkages between Microblogs are very sparse. Thus the strength of influential microblog could not be predicted by the four proposed blog properties. Hence, we have new general assumption for Microblogging platform. The influential microblog is suggested by the number of Microbloggers who forward the Microblog. The more Microbloggers forward a Microblog, the more influential the Microblog gets.

In this section, we firstly check the presented assumption using hypothesis testing method in feature extraction subsection. And then tensor factorization is employed to predict the latent factors that govern the strength of Microblogger social influence. Finally, social influence measurement function is introduced to rank the Microblogger according to the latent factors.

1 Feature Extraction A Microblog is often forwarded, commented, or  thumbed up on Microblogging service platform by its readers. And the influential strength of Microblog could be inferred through analyzing the activities of its readers. Since the Microblog?s text is very short and the factor exerting the dissemination of the Microblog?s influence is the forwarding activity, we assume that the number of Microbloggers who forward the Microblog is more essential then other factors to suggest the influence of the Microblog.

In order to verify the assumption, Hypothesis Testing experiment is performed using Chinese Weibo Dataset.

Though the volume of Microblogger?s fans could not directly infer the influence of a microblog, it could also reflect the popularity of Microblogger. Therefore, we can rank the Microbloggers according to the volume of Microblogger?s fans, and split the whole dataset into two subsets by the Medians of the fans? volume. Therefore, we can rank the Microbloggers according to the volume of Microblogger?s fans, and split the whole dataset into two subsets by the Medians of the fans? volume. Obviously, there exists significant difference on the influence between the two subsets. Hence, the statistic difference of the interacting activities between the two subsets can be used to prove the proposed assumption. Our assumption is reasonable if the forwarding activity has more significant difference than other interacting activities. Moreover, a rank correlation coefficient in statistics can measure the significance of the relation between two rankings. So, we can verify significant difference of the forwarding activity by comparing the rank correlation coefficients between three types of interacting activities and fans, respectively.

The Hypothesis Testing steps are the following:  1 Sort Microbloggers by the volume of their fans, and split Microbloggers dataset into two subsets according  to the Medians of the fans? volume. Let formerS  be the  subset which has less fans, and latterS  be the subset which  has more fans.

2 For each interacting activity, calculate the mean  of the activity on formerS and latterS . former?  is the mean  of the activity on formerS , and latter?  is  the mean of the  activity on latterS .

3 Compare the difference between former?  and  latter? . Thus, null hypothesis is latterformer ?? ? , and  alternative hypothesis is latterformer ?? ? .

4 Assume the activity on formerS and latterS  follow Gaussian distribution (i.e.

1 1~ ( , )formerX N ? ? ,  2 2~ ( , )latterX N ? ?  ),  and compute the test statistic  T :  1 2( ) ~ ( 2) 1 1  former latter former latter  w former latter  T t n n S  n n  ? ? ? ?? ? ? ? 	 ?    Where formern  is the size of formerS  and lattern  is the  size of latterS .

5 Under the level of significance , construct  rejection region ? ? ?2?	?? latterformer nntTW . That is, if the value of the test statistic T  falls in this region, then the decision is to reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, we retain the null hypothesis.

6 Finally, calculate p value (i.e. ? ?TxPp ?? ) for evaluating the level of test. The less p  value is, the more trustable the test will be.

According to the above steps, we perform the Hypothesis Testing experiment on Weibo dataset. The testing results are shown in Table 1.

Table 1: Hypothesis Testing Results  Interacting  activity  Statistic T  t  p-value Testing result  Thumb-up -2.364732 -1.655285 0.009674788 0.05 former latter? ??  Forwarding -2.788807 -1.655285 0.01047729 0.05 former latter? ??  Comment -2.32408 -1.655285 0.01074555 0.05 former latter? ??  The results show that there is strong evidence (with the significance level = 0.05) to reject the null hypothesis in all tests on three types of interacting activities. That is to say, all of three types of interacting activities can reflect the influence of Microblogger.

In order to further verify the forwarding activity can     most reflect the influence of Microblogger. The rank correlation coefficients between three types of interacting activities and fans are computed, respectively. The computing results are given in Table 2.

Obviously, the rank correlation coefficient between the forwarding activity and fans is more significant than other interacting activities. Hence, our assumption is reasonable.

Table 2: Rank Correlation Coefficients  Rank Correlation  Coefficient  Thumb-up Forwarding Comment  Fan 0.4070363 0.4838018 0.3289258  2 Tensor Factorization The vector is often used for representation of text based  on Bag-of-words model. Obviously, it has not enough space to hold interaction information between Microbloggers.

Therefore, a tensor-based approach is proposed to model three types of objects: Microblogger, Microblogger and activity. The forwarding activity data is represented by a 3-order tensor, on which 3-mode factorization is employed to mine the latent factors that govern the interactions.

According to the latent factors, social influence function is developed to rank Microblogger.

From the forwarding activity data, we can construct a 3-order tensor:  ( )ijk N M NX x ? ??     (1)  Where 1?ijkx  represents that the Microblog jp  published by Microblogger iu  is forwarded by  Microblogger ku .

Thus, according to [6], the value of ijkx  could be  predicted by tensor factorization:  predictH S U P V? ? ? ?     (2) Where S  is the central tensor where K is the  dimension of the model latent factors. V,P,U  be latent publisher, Microblog, and forwarder feature matrices, with  column vector iu  representing K-dimensional publisher  -specific latent feature vector of publisher iu , column  vector jp  representing K-dimensional Microblog-specific  latent feature vector of Microblog jp  , and column vector  kv representing K-dimensional forwarder-specific latent  feature vector of forwarder kv . The goal of tensor  factorization is to learn these latent variables and exploit them for social influence prediction.

Assuming that the forwarding counts of microblog ip  follow normal distribution (i.e. ),(N~p iii 2?? ), the  tensor factorization is converted into a simpler optimization problem by maximum likelihood estimation. Given the feature matrices and the central tensor, the prediction can be made as follows:  1 1 1  K K K  ijk ijk xyz ix jy kz x y z  x h s u p v ? ? ?  ? ????   (3)  Where ijkh  is the predicted value for ijkx and K  is  the dimension of latent features. Therefore, the objective function for the minimization problem is as follows:  2 2  2 2 2  1min [ ] || || 2 2  || || || || || || 2 2 2  NpNu Nv Nu u  TF ijk ijk ijk i F i j k i  NpNv pv s  j F k F ijk F j k ijk  E I x h u  v p s  ?  ?? ?  ? ?    ??? ?  ? ? ? (4)  Where NMNijk )I(I ???  is the indication tensor  which could be defined as follows:  ? ? ?  ? .plogmicrobpublisht'doesnugerlogMicrob;  ;plogmicrobpublishesugerlogMicrob; I  ji  ji ijk 0   (5)  F||X||  is the Frobenius norm of a matrix X , and  )XX(Tr||X|| TF ? . This optimization problem can     be minimized by using stochastic gradient descent.

3 Social Influence Measurement According to [19], an influential user is the one who  has more than one influential post. Under this assumption, the strength of Microblogger?s influence can be directly defined as the influence of the microblog which has the most influence:  ?jPpi pofluenceinfthemaxf iuj??    (6)  Where if  is the influence of the Microblogger iu  and iu  P is the set of microblogs published by iu .

Incorporating the indication tensor I , the formula can be written as:  1,2,..., 1  max Nv  i ijk ijkj Np k f I x  ? ?  ? ?? ? ? ? ? ?  (7)  Then, the corresponding influence score of  Microbloggers }u,...,u,u{U N21? is  }f,...,f,f{f N21? . We can rank the users by if .

C. Distributed Model As Microblogging service platform may contain  millions of Microblogger and produce very huge volume of data, it is impractical to carry out our proposed tensor-based algorithm using a single computer. In particular, the calculation of H matrix has become a performance bottleneck in our tensor-based algorithm. To address the challenge, we employ MapReduce model to develop distributed algorithm for dealing with the task of calculating H matrix on a distributed system during the learning process.

MapReduce [18] is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large datasets that is amenable to a broad variety of real-world tasks. It takes a set of input key/value pairs, and produces a set of output key/value pairs. The user of MapReduce often expresses the computation as two functions: map and reduce. In our proposed tensor-based algorithm, we partition the large Microblogging dataset into subsets and distribute each subset to a process node. For  each subset, ijkh  is calculated for predicting the value of  ijkx  according to Eq.(3). Thus, the calculation of ijkh  in  a subset could be implemented as a map stage for deploying on a distributed node. The MapReduce process of H matrix is shown in Figure 1.

III. EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS  In this section, we firstly present several experiments to compare prediction accuracy of our tensor-based approach with other state-of-the-art matrix-based methods. And then, the scalability performance of our distributed approach based on MapReduce Model is evaluated for the efficiency as the fast growth of Microblogging data.

A. Description of the Chinese Weibo Dataset To the best of our knowledge, there is no Chinese  Microblogging service dataset for social influence analysis.

Therefore, we created a new Chinese Weibo dataset from Sina weibo service platform. The dataset consists of 2564 microblogs from 100 Microbloggers during 2013-09-09 to 2013-09-15. And each Microblogger published about 25 microblogs on average.

B. Prediction Accuracy (1) Metrics Firstly, we use the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  metrics to measure the prediction quality of our proposed approach in comparison with other matrix-based methods.

RMSE is defined as:  2( )  | |  predict Data  x x RMSE  Data  ? ? ?  (8)  where predictx  is the predicted value for the original  data x . Obviously, the smaller the metric the more precise  the prediction result is.

Secondly, Precision at rank k (P@k) is employed to evaluate the precision of our proposed approach. It is defined as the coincidence rate of the predicted ranking list and the ground truth ranking list for the top- k users:   | |@ k kA Bp k  k ?  ?           (9)  where kA  is the set of top-k users in the gold ranking  list. kB  is the set of top-k users in the experimental  ranking list.

(2) Comparison In this section, in order to evaluate the performance of  our tensor factorization approach, we compare Tensor Factorization (TF) approach with Matrix Factorization (MF) approach based on Chinese Weibo Dataset. Different numbers of latent feature is employed to test both of the approaches. The performance of RMSE with varying K values is shown in Figure 2. Compared with MF approach, TF approach achieves consistently better performance with different number of latent feature.

From Figure 2, as K increases, the RMSE also increases.

And the best RMSE of tensor factorization approach is achieved when K is set 2. Therefore, in the following experiments, we set 2?K .

Fig 2: Performance Comparison on Different Values of K  To further measure the performance of TF approach, we compare the user ranking lists by TF and MF approaches with the manually labeled user ranking list, respectively.

The comparison results on P@K are shown in Table 3. In these results, we can clearly see that TF approach generally outperforms MF approach.

Table 3: Ranking Accuracy with MF and TF on P@K  Approach p@5 p@10 p@15 MF 0.40 0.40 0.40 TF 0.40 0.50 0.47  In summary, the superior performance of the TF approach validates its excellent use of Microblogger social influence analysis.

C. Scalability Performance (1) Metrics The scalability of our distributed approach based on  MapReduce model was evaluated by the Speed-up ratio, which is defined as the ratio between time needed in single processor system and parallel processor system. The formula is as follows:  p  p  TS T  ?      (10)  where 1T  is the time that running under the single  processor, and pT   is the time running under P child node     in the parallel system.

(2) Comparison To test the scalability of our MapReduce?based  distributed approach, we randomly generated four different sizes of test data sets in which VP ?  dimension is 1000 * 1000 and U  dimensions are 100/1000/10000/100000 respectively.

Firstly, we measure running time of our distributed approach on MapReduce Model varying different scale datasets with 100/1000/10000/100000 respectively. The experimental results are shown in Figure 3. In the figure, when the Microblogger number is 100, time on twelve nodes is more than two nodes. However, with the increasing of test data scale, time on more than one node is significantly less than the operational time on single node. Thus, the experimental result illustrates the H matrix calculation based on the MapReduce Model can effectively alleviate the performance bottleneck with the growth of data size.

Fig 3: Running Time on different scale data in cloud platform (log scale)  Secondly, speed-up ratio on different number of nodes is used to evaluate our proposed method?s performance and effect of parallel computation. Using our large citation data set, we also perform speedup experiments on a Hadoop platform using 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 computer nodes. The experimental results are shown in Figure 4, where it is observed that speed-up ratio is rising with the increasing of nodes. In particular, time on twelve nodes cost more than that on two nodes when Microbloggers? size is 100. The reason is that when the cloud platform dealing with small amount of data, the cost of task scheduling and network communication overhead outperforms the time saving from node?s  increments. However, with the increment of the data scale, the speedup shows reasonable parallel efficiency  with 10 pS  speedup using 12 computer nodes.

Fig 4: Speedup ratios on different scale data in cloud platform

IV. CONCLUSION  In this paper, a tensor factorization framework based on cloud computing platform is proposed for mining social influence in Microblogging. In the framework, features are extracted for capturing user social influence quantitatively through statistical analysis on the Microbloggers? relations. And then Tensor factorization is employed to infer user?s implicit user?s relations. Furthermore, a distributed learning algorithm has been implemented under the Map-reduce programming model. Finally, a user influence ranking function is constructed for computing user social influence in user influence ranking component.

Experiments on Sina Weibo dataset (Chinese Microblogging platform) show that our proposal significantly not only improves the prediction accuracy compared with two baseline methods, but also has competitive advantage for processing massive data from Microblogging .
