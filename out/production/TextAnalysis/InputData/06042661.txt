Improving Medical Image Retrieval through Multi-Descriptor Similarity Functions and Association Rules

Abstract  Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems still face  the problem of low precision of system results. To improve  the precision of such systems, many image visual extractors  have been developed and employed to represent the ima-  ges. However, the usage of a large number of extractors and  consequently, a large number of features, leads to the ?di-  mensionality curse?, where the retrieval performance and  the query accuracy diminish. In this paper, we propose a  new method, called Statistical Fractal-scaled Product Me-  tric (SFPM), to maximize the accuracy of CBIR systems and  speedup similarity queries. The SFPM method combines  association rule mining and the Fractal-scaled Product Me-  tric (FPM) [4], to determine a reduced set of features and  appropriate scale factors in multi-descriptor image simila-  rity assessment. The FPM is an unsupervised method to  determine a scale factor among features in multi-descriptor  image similarity assessment based on the Fractal Theory.

Experiments have shown that SFPM reduced the feature  vector size in up to 65% and improved in up to 27% the  query precision when comparing with the use of the FPM te-  chnique. The results show that the proposed method SFPM  is effective in determining a reduced set of features and a  near-optimal set of scale factors for the descriptors invol-  ved, and it is well-suited to improve the quality of content-  based query in CBIR systems.

1. Introduction  The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard allows storing the study information with the image. In this context, the development of picture  archiving and communication system (PACS) has contribu- ted to the effective use of digital images in diagnosing as well as training new physicians. In order to be effectively useful, image retrieval in PACS should be fast and consis- tent with the specialist expectation. Hence, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) techniques have been intensively re- searched in the last years.

Most queries in a PACS are based on metadata. Howe- ver, querying images based on their visual characteristics has proven to be a suitable complement to text-based se- arch. For instance, visual features not only allow the retrie- val of cases where patients have similar diagnoses, but also the identification of cases with visual similarity but different diagnoses [13]. Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is a technology that helps to manage digital picture archives organized by their visual content [9].

To obtain the visual representation of the images, they are submitted to image processing algorithms, which gene- rate a mathematical signature describing the properties of the image content. Thereafter, the signatures can be com- pared through a function to measure the similarity between them, yielding performing queries based on similarity cri- teria. One of major challenge of CBIR systems is the low precision of the systems results. One way of improving the query accuracy is to employ various feature extractors to describe the image content. However, uncontrolled incre- ase of the features into a composite vector may degrade the performance and the precision of the results as well. Com- bining multiple descriptors requires a strategy that both ena- bles employing the best integration between the binomial feature extractor-distance function for each descriptor, and states a proper balance of the descriptors in the similarity calculations. However, the methods for weighting multiple descriptors encountered in the literature are either based on   asidhu  asidhu    exhaustive experimentation or in supervised techniques.

In this paper we present a new method to improve  the CBIR precision and speedup similarity queries. This  method combines association rule mining and the Fractal- scaled Product Metric (FPM), to determine a reduced set of features and a set of scale factors in multi-descriptor image  similarity assessment. The association rule mining is em-  ployed to perform feature selection in each descriptor set,  and the FPM method is employed to balance these redu-  ced multi-descriptors. The FPM method is based on the  intrinsic dimensions of the feature spaces, approximated by  their respective fractal dimensions. Moreover, the compo-  site distance function enables using scalable access methods  to speed up data searching. Experiments have shown that  the proposed method is effective in determining a reduced  set of features and a near-optimal set of scale factors for the  descriptors involved and, also, the method always improves  the precision of the results.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sec-  tion 2 introduces the basic concepts for the paper and the  main related work. The proposed method is described in  Section 3.2. Section 4 shows results of some of the experi-  ments performed to evaluate the proposed method. Finally,  Section 5 presents the conclusions and future work.

2. Background and Related Work  In CBIR, image retrieval is mainly performed regarding  similarity. The basic types of similarity queries are the k- nearest neighbor query and the range query. Similarity que-  ries are performed comparing the feature vectors using a  distance function - or dissimilarity function - to quantify  how close (or similar) two vectors are.

Several distance functions can be considered, e.g., the  Minkowski function family (including the well-known Eu-  clidean distance function), the Mahalanobis distance func-  tion and the cosine function. Two crucial issues in the CBIR  systems are: first, how to define a signature (feature vector)  that represents the image content; second, how to compute  the similarity between a pair of images based on their sig-  natures. [9].

The visual properties of an image are commonly descri-  bed in terms of color, texture and shape. These descriptors  are extracted by image processing algorithms either glo-  bally for the entire image or locally for regions of interest,  defined manually or by a segmentation algorithm. These  algorithms, called feature extractors, compute a number of  values, usually numeric, that compose the signatures repre-  senting the images, also referred to as feature vectors. There  are many image feature extractors documented in the litera-  ture, such as the histogram for color, the Haralick descrip-  tors for texture and the Zernike moments for shape [1].

In most real situations, employing various feature ex-  tractors to describe the image content improve the accuracy  of the results because they provide complementary charac-  teristics that contribute to the representation of the image  content. However, the usage of a large number of extrac-  tors and consequently, a large number of features, leads to  the ?dimensionality curse?, where the retrieval speed and  the query accuracy diminish. Consequently, suitable appro-  aches to combine feature extractors without degrading the  results are needed.

A suitable approach to combine multiple descriptors  computes the similarity for each of them in a base level and  then aggregates the partial similarities using a composition  function. Let any image x be represented by a set of n des- criptors x1, . . . , xn, each generated by a feature extraction algorithm, and ?1, . . . , ?n be distance functions defined over the domains of the respective descriptors. The composition  distance function ? between two images x, y is a combi- nation of the individual distances ?i(xi, yi), usually given by:  ?(x, y) = n?  i=1  wi ? ?i(xi, yi) (1)  where wi is the weight assigned to the respective descrip- tor. Several systems employed this strategy [11, 7], but the  main drawback of such systems is that they determine the  weights of each component by means of exhaustive search.

Some approaches were proposed relying either on relevance  feedback cycles [10] or on supervised techniques[6]  Metric spaces are more adequate to represent multime- dia data, as they only require the elements and their pairwise  distances [19]. A metric space is formally defined as a pair  ?S, ??, where S is a data domain and ? is a metric. A me- tric is a distance function that satisfies the following metric axioms, ?x, y, z ? S:  1. symmetry: ?(x, y) = ?(y, x);  2. non-negativity: 0 < ?(x, y) < ? if x ?= y and ?(x, x) = 0;  3. triangular inequality: ?(x, y) ? ?(x, z) + ?(z, y).

Therefore, both adimensional  and dimensional data can  be represented in a metric space, being sufficient to define  proper metrics to compare the data.

The usage of a metric distance to compute the dissimila-  rity between images also enables to adopt a Metric Access  Method (MAM) to speed up the similarity queries execu-  tion. There are many MAMs proposed [12], like M-Tree [8] and Slim-tree [17]. Experimental evaluation has shown that MAMs are very effective for indexing image data, achieving  superior performance and scalability than other structures.

Adimensional data are those for whom no dimensionality can be as-  signed.

asidhu    Having introduced the basic concepts, we present our  new method to improve CBIR systems combining multiple  extractors in the next section.

3. Proposed Method: SFPM  The proposed method Statistical Fractal-scaled Product Metric (SFPM) is a technique that maximizes the query ac- curacy in the same time that minimizes the number of featu-  res employed to perform the query. The method combines  a statistical approach to perform feature selection and an  approach based on fractal theory to find the most suitable  weight of features, according to their distinguishing power.

The SFPM method employs the Fractal-scaled Product Me- tric (FPM), wich is based on the intrinsic dimensions of the feature spaces, approximated by their respective fractal di-  mensions. The composite weight set and the selected fea-  tures enable the use of scalable access methods to speed up  data searching.

The method SFPM is illustrated in Figure 1. The images  from the database are submitted to a set of feature extrac-  tors. Each image is represented by set of feature vectors  which are submitted to a feature selection process through  the StARMiner algorithm (as described in the next subsec-  tion), producing a reduced set of features for each extractor,  i.e. producing reduced feature vectors regarding their di-  mensionality. The properties of the reduced feature vectors  are analyzed using the fractal theory by the FPM method,  as described in Section 3.2, producing scale factors for the  multi-descriptors. Finally, the reduced feature vectors and  the scale factors are employed in the CBIR system to exe-  cute the similarity queries asked by the user, improving the  precision of the result and the speed of the query execution.

3.1 Statistical Association Rules for Fea- ture Selection  The SFPM method employs an algorithm, named StAR-  Miner [14], to mine statistical association rules from a da-  taset. The mined rules are used to select the most relevant  features, making a new and enhanced representation of the  images.

Let T be a dataset of medical images, x an image class,  Tx ? T the subset of images of class x and F a feature. Let ?F (Z) and ?F (Z) be, respectively, the mean and standard deviation of the values of feature F in the subset of ima-  ges Z. The algorithm uses three thresholds defined by the  user: ??min - the minimum allowed difference between the average of the feature F in images from class x and the  average of F in the remaining dataset; ??max - the ma- ximum standard deviation of F values allowed in a given  class and; ?min - the minimum confidence to reject the hy- pothesis H0. StARMiner algorithm mines rules of the form  x ? F , if the conditions given in Equations 2, 3 and 4 are satisfied.

?f (Tx)? ?f (T ? Tx) ? ??min (2)  ?f (Tx) ? ??max (3)  H0 : ?f (Tx) = ?f (T ? Tx) (4)  In Equation 4, H0 should be rejected with a confidence  equal to or greater than ?min, in favor of the hypothesis that the means ?f (Tx) and ?f (T ? Tx) are statistically diffe- rent. A rule x ? F , returned by the algorithm, relates a feature F with a class x, where values of F have a statisti-  cally different behavior in images of class x. This property  indicates that F is an interesting feature to distinguish ima-  ges of class x from the remaining images. Therefore, the  feature selection performed in our approach is: The set S of relevant features are composed of the features F present in the rules returned by StARMiner. These features have a particular and uniform behavior in images of a given class.

3.2 Fractal-scaled Product Metric (The FPM method)  Feature extractors produce signatures comparable th-  rough metrics, so each one generates a metric space. The  standard way of aggregating n metric spaces Mi = ?Si, ?i?, 1 ? i ? n, is defining a metric over the cartesian product M1 ?M2 ? ...?Mn, which is called a product metric.

The Fractal-scaled Product Metric (FPM) method [4] calculates the scale factors (the weights wi of Equation  1) between the composed metrics based on the correlation  fractal dimension D2 of each original metric space created  by the extracted descriptors. Knowing D2 of a dataset al-  lows predicting its properties as being similar to that of a  dimensional dataset with approximately the same embed-  ded dimension[3].

The main idea of the FPM is to identify the contribu- tion for the overall similarity calculation of each descriptor.

Since the value of the intrinsic dimension reveals the pre-  sence of correlations among the attributes of a dataset, the  fractal dimension provides an estimate of a lower bound for  the number of features needed in a similarity search to keep  the essential of data information.

Therefore, scaling the multiple descriptors in the pro-  duct metric by their intrinsic dimensions approximated by  the value of D2, neither overestimate nor underestimate the  contribution of each descriptor in the similarity assessment.

The correlation fractal dimension can be calculated using  the Box Counting method [15, 18] or using the technique  proposed in [16].

The FPM method performs normalization to reduce the  effects of the range difference in the similarity computation.

To do so, it uses the largest known distance dmaxi for each descriptor. In summary, the FPM metric is given by:  ?(x, y) = n?  i  D2i ? ?i(xi, yi) dmaxi  (5)  The values of dmaxi can be measured by computing the distances between all pairs of elements considering each descriptor, but this operation is quadratic on the number of elements. However, cheaper techniques can be employed to estimate this value. For example, if a MAM is indexing the data referred to the descriptor i, it is feasible to get a close approximation stating dmaxi as the diameter of the region covered by the MAM?s root node. Refer to paper [5] to a more complete discussion of the notion of scaling metric spaces using fractals.

4. Experiments  This section presents results of experiments performed to evaluate the proposed method. The software developed was implemented in C++ using the Slim-tree MAM [17], available in the Arboretum2 library to index data. To per- form the experiments we have used medical image datasets provided by the Clinical Hospital of the Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sa?o Paulo, Brazil.

The first dataset used, called MRI 704, consists of 704 images of images of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exams. The dataset is divided in 40 classes according to the region of body examined, the slice position and the type  2Available at http://gbdi.icmc.usp.br/arboretum  of specified section. Each image of the MRI 704 database was processed by two feature extractors: Haralick?s Texture and Zernike moments, that contains the first 256 moments of Zernike describing the image shapes.

The second dataset (2), called CT Lung ROIs, consists of 3257 images, containing Regions of Interest (ROIs) of images of Computed Tomography (CT) lung exams, and it is organized in 6 classes, being one normal and 5 of abnor- mal patterns. These images were processed using the Ha- ralick?s Texture and the first 256 moments of Zernike. The Manhattan distance (L1) was used in all experiments.

4.1. Results  We employed Precision versus Recall (P?R) graphs [2] to evaluate the quality of the query results. The recall of a query is calculated as: recall = |Ra||R| , where |Ra| is the  asidhu    number of relevant elements retrieved and |R| is the number of relevant elements that should be retrieved. The precision of a query is given by: precision = |Ra||A| , where |Ra| is the number of relevant elements retrieved and |A| is the size of the answer set. A simple way to interpret a P?R curve is the closer the curve to the top, the better the technique.

The first step of SFPM is the StARMiner feature selec- tion process, which performed a significant reduction in the number of features of the feature vectors. StARMiner mi- nes rules relating image classes and the most discrimina- tive features. The feature selection process performed by StARMiner removes the noise and redundant features that interferes negatively in the query result, not only speeding up the whole process, but also improving the query preci- sion. Regarding the MRI 704 dataset, the StARMiner se- lected 86 from the 256 original set of features generated by Zernike extractor, and 90 from the 140 features gene- rated by the Haralick texture descriptor. When analyzing the CT Lung ROIs, StARMiner selected 123 from the 256 initial set of Zernike features, and 80 from the 140 initial texture features. The feature selection step of SFPM per- formed a reduction of up to 65% in the feature vector size, making the content-based search faster and also more accu- rate.

Figure 3 shows the P?R graph comparing the retrie- val quality of employing each individual descriptor of the MRI 704 database, the combination of original descriptors using the FPM method, and the results obtained with the proposed method, the SFPM. The SFPM method outperfor- med the individual descriptors and the FPM method in all recall levels, having improved in some of them the preci- sion up to 15% over using only the Zernike descriptor, up to 157% over using only the Haralick descriptor and up to 14% over FPM method.

The Figure 4 shows the results of the same kind of expe- riment with the CT Lung ROIs database, showing the P?R graph of the invidual descriptors, FPM applied on original descriptors, and the results obtained with SFPM method.

Again, the SFPM method achieved better results in all re- call levels, with precision improvements of up to 75% over using only the Zernike descriptor, up to 47% over using only the Haralick descriptor and up to 27% over FPM method, in some recall levels.

5. Conclusions and Future Work  In this paper we proposed the Statistical Fractal-scaled Product Metric (SFPM) method to improve the quality of content-based query in CBIR systems. The proposed method combines association rule mining and the Fractal- scaled Product Metric (FPM) technique to determine a re- duced set of features and a set of scale factors for multi- descriptor image similarity evaluation.

The association rule mining is employed to perform fea- ture selection using statistical measures. The FPM method employs the fractal theory to approximate the intrinsic di- mensions of the feature spaces and to determine the weight of the feature vectors in the similarity measure.

Experiments have shown that the proposed method is ef- fective in determining a reduced set of features and a near- optimal set of scale factors for the descriptors involved. The proposed SFPM method reduced the feature vector size in up to 65%, and improved the precision of the queries in up to 157% regarding the usage of only a feature extractor.

Also, the SFPM method improves in up to 27% the query precision when comparing with the use of the FPM techni- que.

Future work includes testing different distance functions and image descriptors with the proposed method, and tes- ting other product metrics to combine multiple descriptors.
