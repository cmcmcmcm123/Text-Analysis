The Design of Database Anomalous Detection Model Based on User Behavior  Profile Mining

Abstract-A model of database anomalous detection is designed in this paper. The model can not only describe the users' behavioral profIle more accurately, but also improve the  accuracy of database anomalous detection. Based on the designed model, Apriori-kl algorithm, which combines the K? means clustering algorithm with the improved Apriori algorithm, is presented to mine users' behavior profIle  preferably so as to detect database anomaly more effectively and efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with the Apriori mining algorithm, Apriori-k1 is  superior in terms of time-consuming and detection accuracy.

I. INTRODUCTION  As the development of intrusion detection technology and data mining technology, the database auditing log which is seen as a passive concept of security has changed [1].lt is an important means to ensure the database security that database exception is actively detected by the user behavior profile of the database mining [2].The user behavior profile is the regular access certain resource including the database, data tables and so on. This long-term regular operation of a resource is characteristics of the user behavior patterns.

At present, there are mainly three aspects deficiency existed in the users' behavior profile mining. First, due to the various types of audit logs in the database management system ,it is rather difficult to select what audit records can be effectively used to mine the users' behavior profile.

Second, as the existing algorithms can not correctly describe the users' behavior profile, resulting in higher false positive rate of database anomalous detection. Third, although some existing algorithms can achieve mining the users' behavior profile, when referring to the massive user database access logs they significantly lack of efficiency [3].

This paper mainly does the following two key researches to solve the above questions: Firstly, A database model is designed for anomaly detection. Secondly, Apriori-kl algorithm based on this model is proposed, which is a more efficient detection of abnormal database algorithm.

As shown in Fig. 2.

B. Data Preprocessing Module  Main function: After the data collection (audit training information, the current inspection of data), to remove the original noise data, such as, incomplete audit data no specific operational users, no operating object data and ?ther important information, as well as stemming some data is not associated with the required data from related communication link protocol when database server is connected by client.

C. Data Merge Module  Main function: Firstly, to statistic the number of operational database objects, such as data table, data view and so forth operated by this user. Secondly, to deal with the operation object and user by means of the numerical identification, and then stored in the established session record table. Furthermore, each connected operation record is regarded as a transaction T, all of transaction T constitutes the database D, which is be used for mining user behavior characteristics. Each transaction belonged to the database D is composed of the field of session connection ID, the field of Database operation user, the field of operation object, the field of operation path, and so on a total of eleven fields.

The form of the table of session connection is the below Fig. 3.

D. User Behavior Mining Module  Main Function: First, the operation on the database operated by the user and the user's database objects need to be clustered by using the k-means algorithm in the data mining ?ec?ology, thus completing the Preliminary CharactenzatIOn of user behavior. Also make the first preparing for further mining of user behavior characteristics.

Second, to improve the efficiency of mining characteristic rules about user behavior through using the improved algorithm Apriori-kl, and then will tap into the knowledge of rules out the rules database.

by mmmg the Session connection records in the table transaction.

For example, the meaning of the first rule: In all session connection record of the transaction database, there is 27.35 percent conversation is that the database user Jack access to the table of "filling" in the database server through client whose path named "www-0gecb2cdb98". Under the circumstance that the database user is Jack and the operation path is "www-0gecb2cdb98", there may be 94.65 percent session connection meaning that 10-20 data records will be inserted to the table of "filling".

I? . additi?n, the timing conditions set in the timing condItIOns hbrary can trigger the user behavior digger periodically in the model, and complete the effect of automatic detection on line to some extent. At the same time the database administrator can also manually trigger the user behavior digger.

E. Anomaly Detection Module  Main function: to compare the training phase of the rules produced by normal users (read from old-rules table) with the test phase of mining association rules (to read from new? rules), if the database exception occurred then the unusual details should be timely recorded and displayed.

Anomaly detection algorithm as follows:  Input: The current audit data to be detected Output: The information of detecting anomalies  Method: (1) acquire the begin time of detection: starttime (2) While (each rule in old-rules){ (3) While (each rule in new-rules){ (4) If?the antecedent of rules in old-rules  = the antecedent of rules in new-rules) && ( the consequent of rules in old-rules  = the consequent of rules in new-rules) && ( the difference of support and confidence  between the two rules greater than 35%)) (5) {make intrusion information record  in the Intrusion table} } (7) the end time of detection: endtime (8) record the time spent testing(starttime-endtime) (9) If (interrupt) { (10) break}}

III. THE RESEARCH OF THE MODEL OF KEY TECHNOLOGIES  Enter audit data and the value of cluster K  Figure 4. clustering process  A. Preliminary Characterization of User Behavior Features Based on K-means  This paper mainly make use of k-means clustering algorithm to deal with the users of database and operating object data, so as to characterize the initial behavior profile of users.

The criterion function E of k-means algorithm defined as formula (1) as follows [4-5]:  (1) ;=1 pECi  The clustering process of database users and database objects is shown in Fig. 4.

B. Apriori-kl association rule mining algorithm  Apriori algorithm is proposed for the Boolean association rules mining frequent item sets of original algorithm, in 1994 by R. Agrawal and R. Sriant.Although using Apriori algorithm own nature can increase efficiency to some extent, but there are still many problems led to low efficiency of the algorithm [6].

In order to mine the log data of the database more efficient this paper gives the corresponding improved algorithm Apriori-kl algorithm.

1) Related theorems and conclusions Theorem 1: Suppose frequent k itemset can generate k + 1  itemset, then the number of itemset of the frequent k itemset certainly greater than or equal ? k [7].

Theorem 2: VeE Ck ,  R (c) could be generated by the two elements ofR (x), R (y) (x =1= y) in Rk-I, and R (c) = R (c) n R (c) [8].

Conclusion 1: For each candidate item CE Ck , If obtained by Lk -looLk -I ,the self-connection, and 3t E c satisfy t E Lk -I , then it can also be obtained by Lk -looLI .

The conclusion could be proofed by contradiction.

Proof: Suppose 3c E Ck ,  satisfy c E Lk -looLk -I, as well as c e Lk -looLI .on account of 3t E c, satisfy t E Lk -I ,and also c e Lk -looLI ,so conclud that c - teLl, named C. It is clear that C is in contradiction with the assumed condition that the length of c - t is 1 as well as c E Ck is also obtained through the frequent itemsets. Therefore, for VeE Ck ,exists CE Lk-looLI.

2) The basic idea of Algorithm Data storage format that a transaction identifier  corresponds to multiple forms is known as the standard data format in the transaction database. Whereby, data storage format that a transaction identifier corresponds to multi? transaction identifier related to the item is known as the vertical data format.

The data with standard data format is converted to vertical format by scanning the database once. Meanwhile each item in the itemset and transaction identifier corresponding to the items are stored separately using two dynamic lists storage. The support count of Ck can be obtained by Lk -I n LI without repeating scan of the database to obtain the support count of Ck .

Connection conditions of Apriori algorithm are optimized using the conclusions that are proved in this paper.

Frequent itemset k are got by connection conditions of Lk -looLI , and the last item of Lk -I according to index is compared to each item of LI when Lk -looLI , avoiding duplication of comparison of connection conditions of Lk -looLI ,and without considering whether (k-l) subset of candidate itemset Ck is in Lk -I .

The times of frequent itemset k are optimized by Theorem 1, and the support counts of candidate itemset k are solved by Theorem 2.

3) The Apriori-kl algorithm described as follows:  Input: D: Transaction database min _ support : minimum supportcount  Output: L: Frequent item sets in D Method: (l)CI = {The set of all items} ( 2  )for each Candidate item sets C E C I{R (c) = 0;} (3 )for each transaction tED { (4)Ct = SubSet(t,CI); / / the table of generated each item ID in item set (5)for each C E Ct{R(c) = R(c) u t_TID;}} (6)Count_Support( C I); (7)LI={CE Cllc_delete=O};RI={R(c)lcE LI}; (8)Up_Sort(LI); (9)for(k= 2;ILk -11>k-1 ;k++) { ( l O)Up_Sort(Lk -1);Ck = apriori_gen(Lk -I);} (11 )L= U kLk; (1 2)function Count_Support(C:candidate _ k - itemset) {  for each Candidate item sets c E C; { if(c_support=R (c )<m in_support) {  c_delete= l ;} }} (13 )function apriori_gen(Lk -I: Frequent (k - 1) item sets) { for each h -1 E Lk -I{  if( c _support= IR (c )I<m in_support) { c_delete=I;}  }

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS  Experimental environment: Server computer:  Cpu is P4 2.4Ghz, RAM is DDR 512MB; Database management system uses MSSQL 2000; The audit log data are acquired by MSSQL 2000 Data Pro filer.

A. Experimental 1 : Time Performance Testing  The time performance comparison of the mining of user behavior association rules between the user behavior digger presented in the mode and a simple mining based on Apriori mining algorithm. In the experiment, using 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 database transaction records to test the mining time of the two algorithms in the case of the same support after data clustering process. The result is shown in the below Fig. 5.

V. CONCLUSION  This paper presents a model of database anomalous detection in order to effectively improve the accuracy of database anomalous detection. According to this model, an effective Apriori-kl algorithm is proposed. Compared with Apriori algorithm, Apriori-kl could avoid arising some uninteresting rules to some extent and depict database users' behavior profile more comprehensively. The model has already been used in the practical project and has a good effect in application. Finally, sequence pattern mining applied in users' accessing the database log will be an essential research content in the future.
