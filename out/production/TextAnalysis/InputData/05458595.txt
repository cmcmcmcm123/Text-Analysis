Abstract?First, the meaning of data mining from EMR with a view to discover valuable knowledge, as well as current problems is introduced. Then, several possible storage methods for EMR are deeply analyzed and studied. On this basis, the solution of storage XML EMR with DB2/9.5 hybrid database is presented.

The XQ-Apriori algorithm based on classic Apriori algorithm and XML query language XQuery, as well as an application case for association rules mining directly from XML EMR and other kinds of XML documents is introduced in detail. It is proved the association between diseases can be discovered in effect by using this algorithm. Finally, the application circs and the application scope of the algorithm are summarized and illuminated and further developed research work by author are recommended.

I. INTRODUCTION Electronic Medical Record (EMR) refer to digital medical  work records of which medical institutions used to clinical treatment and guided intervention for outpatient or inpatient (or health care objects), complete and detailed clinical information of which individual residents produced and recorded during the previous treatments[1].

At present, the hospital medical records are written by artificial way in general. A lot of time of doctors has been spent on writing them. And a lot of space has been taken up to conserve them. Inquiry and reading are difficult, and the utilization rate is very low. The long-term conservation value of medical records is affected to a certain extent.

With the push of the informatization process, using computers to store and manage medical records and building EMR will effectively solve this problem. EMR can also be transmitted through the network to better support the long- distance consultations, to meet the need of information exchange and sharing between medical and health agencies. A large number of valuable diagnostic and treatment data existed in medical records, can not only be used for medical analysis and statistics, but also be used to discover many diseases associations, development and changes orderliness of diseases, unprecedented diseases classification, as well as the relationship between diagnosis treatment methods and effectiveness. It will strongly support medical research by discovering these deep-seated relationships.

We can see from the contents of EMR as described earlier that there are a lot of words, images and other unstructured data in EMR, and showed a typical tree structure, so there is a  certain degree of difficulty using traditional relational database to describe and store. However, through analysis and research, we found that XML is very suitable to describe EMR, and XML database can be used to store EMR. Moreover, International Medical Standards Organization HL7 has also released clinical document standard (HL7 CDA standard) based on XML for the purpose of information exchange. At present, the United States, Germany and some other developed countries have even established a national or regional EMR exchange platform, Chinese Ministry of Health also published EMR basic structure and data standards (draft) [1] in August 2009. The purpose is to regulate the development of EMR system in medical institutions, and lay the foundation for the construction of regional EMR exchange platform [2]. Thus, the research is not only extremely meaningful to carry out data mining so as to discover valuable knowledge from EMR with XML documents forms, but also a realistic basis.



II. THE STORAGE OF XML EMR XML has characteristics of self-description, flexible format,  and strong expansibility. So, it has become the most appropriate description manner of EMR information. We can build EMR tree through mapping medical records information to different nodes of XML tree. With constant data input, EMR tree will gradually grow up. As the data content and format of XML is separate, once the format or structure of EMR is changed, we can only adjust XML schema to adapt changing medical records.

Currently, XML documents can use four ways of file system, relational database, object-oriented database and XML database to store [2]:  (1) File system take each XML document as a file, before accessing each XML document, we must carry through syntax parsing, so query and modify is difficult, and the scope of use is very limited.

(2) Using a relational database for XML data access and operation, this is the commonly used method, now. However, changing the semi-structured data into structured data, there are following problems:  1) XML does not support data types, data types are represented by hidden text. The relational data possess rich data types, so we need change text-type data to other types (data, date, etc.) in mapping procedure, we must judge the text- type first of all, this is very difficult to achieve in this way.

2) XML does not require that the tree is balanced, or say does not require that sub-tree contains an equal number of  The Scientific Research Fund Project of Beijing Education Commission (KM200810772007)  2010 Second International Workshop on Education Technology and Computer Science  DOI 10.1109/ETCS.2010.501     children. If use a relational table to deal with the data contained in XML documents, it is likely to be sparse, and a lot of spaces do not contain data. There are some difficulties in processing the sparse data, in current kinds of available data mining algorithms.

3) Existing data table mapping method can only express XML document of simple structure, but not that of database mode structures, such as the logical relationship between some tables.

4) XML may contain a number of components that is difficult to map, such as processing instructions, entity definition and use, property values and the emergence order of same type of elements, the content of CDATA and other coded information, which is easy to result in the loss of information in mapping process.

(3) The object-oriented database allows XML elements and sub-elements store in cluster, thus improved the query efficiency of some applications. However, the object-oriented databases are not very mature, are lack of corresponding standards, have a narrower scope of application, and have not good effect. Thus, to a certain extent, it affected the application of XML on it.

(4) XML database is designed to support the database system which store and deal with semi-structured data. Its internal memory model is consistent with the inherent hierarchical model of XML documents. When access to XML documents, it need not to be dismantled/recombine, so it is more flexible and efficient. It not only provides traditional database technology such as transaction management, security, multi-user access, programming API and query language, etc., but also supports the latest standards of W3C about XML technology, such as support for XQuery/XPath, and so on.

Compared with traditional databases, XML databases have the following characteristics:  1) XML database can efficiently access and manage semi- structured data, such as web pages. Traditional relational database seems to be powerless to.

2 XML database can process tag name and path. The traditional database language can only access the value of the data elements.

3) XML database can express hierarchical data clearly, and can access it easy.

4) Document-oriented XML database is different from traditional data table, its contents are order. So, inquiry, connection and modification are more complex. In the traditional data table, the order of the items of table is interchangeable.

XML database can be divided into XML Enable Data Base (XEDB) and Native XML Database (NXD). XEDB based on the traditional database and increased support to XML, to realize format conversion and transmission between XML data and XEDB. Through appropriate XML API, XML documents can be queried and modified, but can?t be stored in XML format. From the storage size, entire XML document can be taken as a row of RDBMS table. Or, storage a XML document to the appropriate table after parsing. Thus, we can see it is very inconvenient for XML data processing. The typical  representatives of such databases are SQL Server/2005 and ORACLE/10.

NXD is specifically designed for storing and managing XML documents. It takes XML documents as a database storage unit for operations and management. NXD generally use the hierarchical data storage model, and maintaining the tree structure of XML documents, eliminating the data conversion processing between XML documents and traditional database. Some typical representatives of such databases are commercial Ipedo, X-Hive, Xyleme and Tamino, as well as open-source Berkeley DB XML, dbXML, XDB, Xindice, and so on. Such kind of databases are generally not mature enough, as it is designed for semi-structured data storage and processing, so its processing efficiency is very low for structured data. As we know that EMR contains both unstructured data and structured data, therefore, using such kind of databases is still insufficient.

The DB2/9.5 is a hybrid database which IBM issued, not long ago. It can store and process conveniently and efficiently both unstructured data and the structured data. It can directly retrieve and process the node of XML node tree using XQuery, XPath and other XML query language, is very suitable for the application of EMR, especially the application of the regional exchange platform of EMR [3][4][5]. It is easy to implement the data integration and application integration with hospital information system (HIS). In view of this, we have chosen and used the DB2 V9.5.

One of the most important features of XML document is the separation of content and display output format. EMR document of XML itself does not have the format information, It implement display and conversion of the contents which is described in XML through XSL style sheet language [4][5]. To this end, we have defined the template that match with various logic components of XML EMR in XSL documents, as well as the match conversion mode. It can well describe the way of which EMR document of XML convert to any other format of document, such as changing to another logical structure of XML documents, HTML documents, XHTML documents.

And that a same style sheet can be used for multiple documents with a similar sources tree structure.

XSL consists of two parts: The first part describes how a XML EMR document converts to available browsing and output formats; the second part defines the format object FO.

When output, a source tree is constructed first according XML EMR document, and then it is transformed to a result tree which can display according to the given XSL. This process is called tree transformation. Finally, interpreting the results tree according to FO tree, and produce an output results [2].



III. DATA MINING BASED ON XML EMR Data mining based on XML EMR can use following three  methods:  The first method is to embed some query languages specifically developed for semi-structured data, such as XQuery, XML-QL, XML-GL, etc., into other application programs, so as to mine directly from a specific XML EMR.

The advantage of this approach is that it may combine the     XML technology and data mining technology closely, and realize easily and conveniently.

The second method is to map unstructured data in XML EMR to an existing relational model or object model, be structured, allowing us use more mature data mining approach to mine [6]. But the relationship and the meaning between the various parts in XML EMR may be lost in the mapping process.

The third method is taking XML EMR as a text, thus some traditional text mining technologies can be used to mine. Such as taking document space as the vector space formed by a group of orthogonal term vector by using Vector Space Model (VSM). Through statistics of word frequency, shrinking dimensions and other steps, make the purposes of machine learning and knowledge accessing. However, this method does not take into account that XML documents still possess some structural features. In addition, large volumes of data and the much more data item may lead to feature vector of document enormous and cause difficulties in mining.

Through analysis and comparison, we choose the first method.

As a result of the hybrid database, medical information stored in it is standard XML data. In addition, taking into account the large number of EMR data entry is mainly through the EMR template as assistance which established by schema and used for all sections and every disease. Therefore, the quality of the data source is very good. The corresponding data pre-processing work is relatively simple, so it needn?t do further elaboration here.

Data mining process is the core of knowledge discovery based on XML EMR. Traditional data mining techniques are mainly for structured data, and can?t deal directly with the semi-structured data in XML EMR. Therefore, if we want to carry out the data mining for XML EMR, we must combine the traditional data mining technology for structured data with the technical specifications about XML, design a data mining algorithm directly for the XML EMR.

XQuery is the XML query standards, provides abundant and powerful query capabilities, by using it we can convert the mining process in traditional association rule mining algorithm for structured data into the mining process for XML documents, this approach is simple and quick .

As the knowledge excavated from the XML EMR database possesses the format of XML document, it can be directly store in a pre-designed table in accordance with the format of the schema defined before. Then, the results are displayed in visual form and in accordance with the specific XSL format, analyzed and evaluated with medical experts.



IV. THE ASSOCIATION RULE MINING ALGORITHM XQ- APRIORI BASED ON XML EMR  The Apriori algorithm is the most classical algorithm to mine association rules for structured data. We introduce the XQuery to the Apriori algorithm to improve it and make it applicable to XML database which store EMR. The basic idea of corresponding XQ-Apriori algorithm is as follows:  (1)According to needs, extract the corresponding node from multiple EMR trees stored in the XML database, generate an XML EMR documents to be excavated;  (2)Mine the association rule from XML EMR documents to discover the association between diseases. The mining process based on XQuery from XML documents is as follows [7]:  First step, obtain frequent item sets from the original XML document;  Second step, derive association rules from the frequent item sets.

(3)The mining results (found knowledge) are displayed through XSL in accordance with the custom of user, for evaluation and improvement.

For example: If you want to mine association rule from the "diagnose results" in XML EMR, first, it is needed to extract the diagnose results nodes from corresponding EMR tree of each patient, to generate an XML document; then, mine association rules from the XML document, and thus obtain the association between the diseases; Finally, display the mining results as visual form.

1. The Frequent Item Set Generating Algorithm  1) Initializing data. Such as determining the minimum support degree $minsup at start, as well as the number of patients $total in XML EMR document, etc.

2) Scanning the entire XML document through XQuery, traversing various nodes in the XML document, reading relevant information from the XML document, generating candidate item set 1 $C, acquiring support degree of every candidate item set 1 at the same time;  3) Leaving item set 1 which is more than or equal to the minimum support degree $minsup, and thus obtaining frequent item sets 1 $l;  4) Processing the obtained information (for example: $minsup, $l, etc.) with XQ-Apriori algorithm, and then calculating the support degree of item sets by scanning the obtained data;  5) Omitting those item sets that support degree is less than the minimum support degree.

Repeat 2) ~ 5), produce other frequent item sets.

2. The Association Rules Generating Algorithm  The idea of which the XQ-Apriori algorithm generates association rules is as follows: For each frequent item set X in the frequent item sets document, find other frequent item set Y in the frequent item sets document, Y to be included in X, and the support (X Y)/support(Y) must be greater than or equal to the minimum confidence degree. Supposing the minimum support degree is 60%, minimum confidence degree is 70%, the algorithm to obtain frequent item sets from the XML document is as follows: let $src:= document(?/emr.xml?) let $minsup := 0.6 let $total := count($src) * 0.7 let $C := distinct-values($src/*) let $l :=(for $itemset in $C  let $items := (for $item in $src/* where $itemset = $item return $item)  let $sup := (count($items) * 0.7) div $total     where $sup >= $minsup return <frequent item sets>  <items> {$itemset} </items> <support degree> {$sup} </support degree> </frequent item sets>)  let $L := $l return <all frequent item sets > {Apriori($l, $L,$minsup, $total, $src)} </all frequent item sets>  For ease of illustration, we introduce an EMR document based on XML:  <Diagnosis information of all patients> <Patient Information ID ="1"> <Diagnosis information> <Disease ID ="1">Diabetes</Disease> <Disease ID ="2">heart infarction</Disease> <Disease ID ="3">hypertension</Disease> <Disease ID ="4">cataract</Disease> </Diagnosis Information> </Patient Information> <Patient Information ID ="2"> <Diagnosis information> <Disease ID ="1">cataract</Disease> <Disease ID ="2">heart infarction</Disease> </Diagnosis Information> </Patient Information> <Patient Information ID ="3"> <Diagnosis information> <Disease ID ="1">Diabetes</Disease> <Disease ID ="2">cataract</Disease> <Disease ID ="3">hypertension</Disease> </Diagnosis Information> </Patient Information> </Diagnosis information of all patients>  The final obtained association rules document is as follows: <All association rules>  <Association rule support_degree="0.6" confidence_degree="0.7"> <Conditions item> <item>diabetes</item> <item>cataract</item> </Condition item> <Results item> <item>hypertension</item> </Results item>  </Association rule> <Association rule support_degree="0.6" confidence_degree="0.7">  <Conditions item> <item>diabetes</item> <item>hypertension</item> </Condition item> <Results item> <item>cataract</item> </Results item>  </Association rules> <Association rule support_degree="0.6" confidence_degree="0.7">  <Conditions of entry> <item>cataract</item> <item>hypertension</item> </Condition item> <Results item> <item>diabetes</item> </Results item>  Because the mining results are also of XML documents, they don?t contain display format of knowledge. So it is needed to display and output the knowledge obtained from data mining in the structure defined by schema, in order to obtain visual results.



V. CONCLUSION The XQ-Apriori algorithm can not only carry out data  mining from EMR database based on XML, but also be used in a variety of XML documents. By applying the algorithm to the EMR based on XML, some very valuable associations between diseases have been found, such as diabetes are often associated with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, cardiovascular disease often accompanied by cardiac autonomic neuropathy, there are close relations between gout and liver, kidney, heart, etc.. Although these results still need to be confirmed, through analysis of the formation mechanism of the disease and a lot of medical research, it will obviously provide directions for medical research. In addition, as XML has been cross-platform universal document standard based on content in Internet environment, on the one hand, the use of XML documents is more and more, on the other hand, the WEB pages information using XML are more and more, therefore, designing data mining algorithms for XML document is of great practical value.

The follow-up work has two aspects. The first aspect is to build the semantic network and to further improve and enhance the efficiency of the algorithm and performance; the other aspect is to take extensive cooperation with medical research workers, select typical cases to conduct a joint research, with a view to discover associations between diseases, provide more valuable reference for the field of medical research.
