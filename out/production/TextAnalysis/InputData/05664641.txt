Mining Irregular Association Rules based on Action & Non-action Type

Abstract  Conventional positive association rules are the  patterns that occur frequently together. These  patterns represent what decisions are routinely made  based on a set of facts. Irregular association rules  are the patterns that represent what decisions are  rarely made based on the same set of facts. Many  domains like Healthcare, Banking etc need the  irregular rule to improve their system. In this paper,  we propose a level wise search algorithm that works  based on action and non-action type data to find  irregular association rules. We have observed that  irregular association rules can be discovered  efficiently based on action type and non-action type  data from large database. To the best of our  knowledge, there is no algorithm that can determine  such type of associations. Its effectiveness has been  demonstrated by testing it for a real world patient  data set.

1. Introduction  Data mining is applied to discover new  information, which is hidden in the existing  information. One of the techniques in data mining is  finding association rule. The first pioneering work to  mine conventional positive association rules was  explained in [1]. In this work, they showed finding  association rule problem can be separated into two  sub problems. After that many algorithms [1-6]  have  been proposed to mine positive association rules  efficiently. These algorithms find rules that represent  decisions that occur frequently  based on a set of  facts. In other words, rules discovered by current  association mining algorithms [1-6] are patterns that  represent what decisions are usually made. In this  problem, we need patterns that are rarely made. We  have proposed a novel mining algorithm that can  efficiently discover the association rules from the  existing data that are strong candidates of variability.

The algorithm uses a different candidate itemset  selection process, a modified candidate generation  process, and a different mechanism of generating  rules from desire itemsets compared to any level-  wise search algorithm. The algorithm treats all the  items as being either actions that include decision,  action and output or non-actions that include facts,  statements and any criterion. In our problem, non-  action items appear very frequently in the data, while  action items rarely appear with the high frequent  non-action items. Negative association rules find  patterns where items are conflict with each other and  do not find decision, which are made rarely. Rare  association rules are the patterns containing rare  items which are less frequent items and do not find  decisions which are made rarely. Irregular pattern  represents wrong decision, illegal practice and  variability in decision.

2. Related Work  A rare association rule forms with rare data items  or between frequent and rare data items. However,  this rule does not map items that are used to make  decision/action to antecedent and items that represent  actions or decision to consequent. Moreover it does  not expect antecedent to be high frequent because it  find rule with high confidence. The algorithms to  find these rules only assign different support based  on items frequency. A number of approaches has  been proposed to mine rare associations [7-11]. In  [7],   minimum support is computed for each item  based on the frequency of the item. In [8], A fixed  minimum support is applied to extract desired  itemsets, which consist of only frequent items and  relative support is applied to extract desired itemsets,  which consist of rare items. In [9], Negative-  Binomial distribution is applied to extract Negative-  Binomial desired itemsets. In [10],   the association  rules are found by taking into consideration only  infrequent items. The approach suggested in [11]  finds the association rules by computing item-wise  minimum support.

A negative association rule presents a relationship  among itemsets and states the presence of some  itemsets in the absence of others. Every positive  association rule P  Q has three corresponding     negative association rules, P ?Q, ?P Q and ?P  ?Q. To extract negative association rules, most  papers employ different correlation measures  between attributes [12-14]. In [13], the author  proposed a level-wise search algorithm for mining  both positive and negative association rules that  employs rule dependency measures. In [14], authors  proposed another level-wise search algorithm for  simultaneously extracting positive and negative  association rules using Pearson correlation  coefficient. In  [15] , author have proposed detection  model  using  multi layer perceptron neural networks  (MLP)  to detect  fraud/abuse problem based on  medical claims. It has been proposed to detect new,  unusual and known fraudulent/abusive behaviors. It  works based on detection model which is very slow  and need huge memory requirement to analyze  existing large database. In [16], author used positive  association rule to build clinical pathways, which can  detect fraud and abuse on new data. However, this  model cannot detect fraud and abuse from the  existing large healthcare data. Our proposed  approach detects fraud and abuse from the existing  large information.

3. Irregular Association Rules  Let D = t1, t2 , . . . , tn be a database of n  transactions with a set of items I = i1, i2 , . . . , im .

Let set of action items of I be AI = ai1 , ai2, . . . , aik where k is the number of action items. Let set of  non-action items of I be  NAI = nai1, nai2 , . . . , naim k where is the  number of non- action items. For an itemset P I  and a transaction t in D, we say that t supports P if t  has values  for all the attributes in P; for conciseness,  we also write P t. By Dp we denote the  transactions that contain all attributes in P. The  support of P is computed as P = Dp  , i.e. the  fraction of transactions containing P. A irregular rule  is of the form: P Q, with P NAI, Q A I, P  Q = . To hold the rule following condition must  meet: P P or support P >=  , P P , Q or support P, Q <  =  and P P ,Q  P P <= confidence where P(x)  is the probability of x.

Data transformation of medical data  4. Mapping complex medical data to  mineable items  For knowledge discovery, the medical data have  to be transformed into a suitable transaction format  to discover knowledge. We have addressed the  problem of mapping complex medical data to items  using domain dictionary and rule base as shown in  figure 1. The medical data are types of categorical,  continuous numerical data, Boolean, interval,  percentage, fraction and ratio. Medical domain  expert have the knowledge of how to map ranges of  numerical data for each attribute to a series of items.

For example, there are certain conventions to  consider a person is young, adult, or elder with  respect to age. A set of rules is created for each  continuous numerical attribute using the knowledge  of medical domain experts. A rule engine is used to  map continuous numerical data to items using these  developed rules.

We have used domain dictionary approach to  transform the data, for which medical domain expert  knowledge is not applicable, to numerical form. As  cardinality of attributes except continuous numeric  data are not high in medical domain, these attribute  values are mapped integer values using medical  domain dictionaries. Therefore, the mapping process  is divided in two phases. Phase 1:  a rule base is  constructed based on the knowledge of medical  domain experts and dictionaries are constructed for  attributes where domain expert knowledge is not  applicable, Phase 2:  attribute values are mapped to  integer values using the corresponding rule base and  the dictionaries.

5. The proposed algorithm     General intuition of this algorithm is as follows:  based on a set of lab tests with same results, if  99%  doctors   practice patients as disease x and  1 percent  doctors practice patients as other diseases, then there  is a strong possibility that this  1 percent doctors are  doing illegal practice. In other words, if consequent  C occurs infrequently with antecedent A and  that is a strong candidate of variability. In every  domain, there are a set of facts. Based on these facts,  decision and action are taken. In a rule S T, if S  contains a set of facts and T contains decision or  action. Then such rules represent the decision T with  their corresponding facts S. If S T has sufficient  support and confidence then it represents that  decision or action T is taken routinely based on facts  S. However, if S is high frequent and rule S-T has  very low confidence. Then it indicates based on facts  S any other decision instead of T is usually taken. It  also indicates that the decision is exceptionally taken  based on these facts. The main features of the  proposed algorithm are as follows:  If minimum support is only used like  conventional association mining algorithm,  desired  itemsets that involve rarely appeared  action items with the high frequent non-action  items will not be found. To find rules that  involve both frequent antecedent part and rare  consequent items, we have used two support  metrics: minimum antecedent support,  maximum antecedent consequent support.

The proposed algorithm uses maximum  confidence constraint instead of widely used  minimum confidence constraint to form the  rules. Moreover, it partitions itemsets into action  item and non-action items instead of subset  generation to form rules.

Rules   have non-action items in the antecedent  and action items in the consequent.

In candidate generation, it does not check the  or more action items to keep that itemset.

Let MAS is minimum antecedent support, MACS  is maximum antecedent consequent support, Ij is the  itemsets of size j, Sm is the desired itemset of size m;  Ck be the sets of candidates of size k. Figure 2 shows  the association mining algorithm for finding irregular  rule. Like algorithm Apriori, our algorithm is also  based on level wise search. Each item consists of  attribute name and its value. Retrieving information  of a 1-itemset, we make a new 1-itemset   if this 1-  itemset is not created already, otherwise update its  support. The non-action 1-itemset is selected if it has  support greater or equal to minimum antecedent  support. The action 1-itemset is selected whatever  support it has. By this way, 1-itemsets are explored  which have high support for antecedent items and  have arbitrary support for consequent items.

5.1. Candidate Generation  The idea behind candidate generation of all level-  wise algorithms like Apriori is based on the  following simple fact: Every subset of a frequent  itemset is frequent so that they can reduce the  number of itemsets that have to be checked.

However, our proposed algorithm in candidate  generation phase check this fact if the itemsets only  contains non-action items. This idea makes itemsets  consist of both rare action items and high frequency  non-action items. If the new candidate contains one  or   more action items then it is selected as a valid  candidate. If the new candidate contains only non-  action items then, it is selected as a valid candidate  only if every subset of   new candidate is frequent.

This way the algorithm keeps the new candidates  that have one or more action items.

5.2. Candidate Selection  We have used two separate supports metrics to filter  out candidates. An itemset with only non-action  items is compared with minimum antecedent support  metric as non-action items  can only  take part in  antecedent part of irregular rule, which  need to be  high frequent. An itemset with   one or more action  items is compared with maximum antecedent  consequent support metric to keep rare action items  with the high frequent non-action items. An itemset  with only non-action items is selected if it has  support greater or equal to minimum antecedent  support. An itemset with   one or more action items  is selected if it has support smaller or equal to  maximum antecedent consequent support. By this  way, itemsets are explored which has high   support  for non-action items and low support for action items  with high support non-action items. Here pruning is  based mostly on minimum antecedent support,  maximum antecedent consequent support and  checki  5.3. Generating Association Rule  This problem needs association rules that represent  irregular relationships between action and non-action  items that occur rarely together. For this reason, the  proposed algorithm uses maximum confidence  constraint    to form rules as it needs rule that has  high support in antecedent portion and has very low  support in itemset from which the rule is generated.

It selects a rule if its confidence is less or equal to  maximum confidence constraint. Moreover, it does  not use subset generation to the itemsets to form  rules. Here an itemset is partitioned into action item  and non-action items. Action items are for  consequent part and non-action items are for     antecedent part. Here each itemset is mapped to only  one rule.

Proof: A single desired itemset consists of action  type items and non-action type items. Action items  and non-action items are mapped to consequent and  antecedent parts respectively. Let I = { i1, i2 n}  be the set of items to be mined, where items can be  either action type or non-action type. Let AI = {ai1,  ai2 u) be  the set of action items to be mined.

Let NAI= { nai1, nai2 v) be  the set of non-  action items to be mined. Each nai has to have  confidence greater than minimum confidence support  to be included as 1- itemset and all ai are included as  1- itemset. Let, C= {c1,c2,c3 n} be the set of  candidate itemsets. A new candidate NC is added to  C if the non-action part of NC named NCNA holds  the following  property:  support (each subset of  NCNA) >= minimum antecedent support. A  candidate c is selected for rule generation if and only  maximum confidence support. Action item  and non  action item of a desired itemset is mapped to  antecedent items and consequent items of a rule. So  every desired itemset is mapped to a single valid  rule. Total rules = number of desired itemsets = S.

Let m is the average number of distinct value, each  multidimensional attribute holds. P is the number of  attributes to be mined. Number of possible different  rules = . Number of discarded rules =  where S is the number of desired itemsets.

6. Results and discussion  The experiments were done using PC with core 2  duo processor with a clock rate of 1.8 GHz and 3GB  of main memory. The operating system was  Microsoft Vista and implementation language was  c#.  We used a patient dataset to verify our method.

The dataset contains items, which are either actions  that include decision, diagnosis and cost or non-  actions that include lab tests, any symptom of patient     and any criterion of disease. Each instance represents  the data of one patient. We have filtered out  instances which has noisy or missing values. The  data set of interest has collected and preprocessed  from the different local hospitals of Bangladesh,  which has 50273 instances and 514 attributes  (included 150 discrete and 364 numerical attributes).

All these data are converted into mineable items  (integer representation) using domain dictionary and  rule base.

Second column of the table  presents the test result, where we used minimum  antecedent support of 70%, maximum antecedent  consequent support of 10% and maximum  confidence of 10%. 49 desired itemsets were  generated in total. 3 rules were discovered in total. It  took about 922.2013 seconds to find these rules.

Third column of the table presents the test result,  where we used minimum antecedent support of 85%,  maximum antecedent consequent support of 5% and  maximum confidence of 5%. 31 desired itemsets  were generated in total. 5 rules were discovered in  total. It took about 1634.5634 seconds to find these  rules.

Figure 3 shows Apriori has taken significant  higher time compared to the proposed algorithm. It is  because pruning in the proposed algorithm is based  on minimum antecedent support, maximum  antecedent consequent support and checking the  -action items. Figure 4 presents if  maximum confidence (MC) increases, number of  valid rules increases. Figure 5 shows how time is  varied with different minimum antecedent support  (MAS) values for irregular rule finding algorithm.

Here we measured the performance of irregular rule  finding algorithm in terms of MAS keeping MACS,  MC, number of action items, number of non-action  items constant. Time is not varied significantly  because MAS has no lead to reduce disk access as  the patient data set has all sizes of candidates for  these MAS values. It has only lead to the number of  valid candidate generations and it can save some  CPU time. As it has lead to the CPU time, the three  different cases   take slightly different time.

Figure 6 shows how time is varied with different  MACS by keeping MAS , MC, number of action  items, number of non-action items constant. Time is  not varied significantly because MACS has no lead  to reduce disk access as the patient data set has all  sizes of candidates for these MAS values. It has only  lead to the number of valid candidate generations  and it can save some CPU time. As it has lead to the  CPU time, the three different cases take slightly  different time. As maximum consequent support     decreases, number of valid candidate generation  decreases For this reason, case with 5% MACS takes  more time than case with 3% MACS and case with  10% MACS takes more time than case with 5%  MACS. Figure 7 illustrates accuracy results for our  proposed algorithm based on minimum antecedent  support. The value of minimum antecedent support  for each presented result is also indicated. The figure  presents MAS has no lead in accuracy, as it is not  used as a parameter in selecting valid candidate and  rules. Figure 8 illustrates accuracy results for our  proposed algorithm based on maximum confidence.

The figure presents maximum confidence has lead in  accuracy as it is used as parameter in selecting valid  rules. As maximum confidence decreases, accuracy  increases and the number of discovered rules  decreases. It is because less confidence indicates that  antecedent and consequent occurs rarely together  in  the dataset.

7. Conclusion  Irregular patterns represent wrong decision,  illegal practice and variability in decision. In this  paper, we propose a level wise search algorithm that  works based on action and non-action type data to  find irregular association rule. The proposed  algorithm has been applied to a real world patient  data set. We have shown significant accuracy in the  output of the proposed algorithm. Although we have  used level-wise search for finding irregular patterns,  each step of our algorithm is different from any other  level-wise search algorithm. Rules generation from  desired item sets is also different from conventional  association mining algorithms.
