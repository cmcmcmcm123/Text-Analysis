Abstract? A common problem in any large grocery store is to make sure the customers find the right product of their choice quickly. The problem gets worse when large grocery stores hold several thousand products and when customers have time constraints; it becomes way too difficult for customers to find the required product quickly. Often customers end up not purchasing the product of their preference just because it is difficult to find and consequently this may directly impact the customer satisfaction of the store. We present a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) enabled cell phone, which is a hybrid system that integrates the RFID technology with case- based reasoning (CBR) and rule-based reasoning (RBR) for suggesting the preferred products to customers and achieve customer satisfaction. Our proposed system analyses the customers? purchase strategies to predict the consumer behavior and provide smart customer service.

I. INTRODUCTION  Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is poised to become one of the fastest growing wireless technologies this decade, with estimates of millions of RFID tags and readers connected on a global scale [1]. It offers great potential benefits in object identification and tracking in diverse application areas such as access control and security, asset and event management, supply chain and manufacturing, health care, environment, oil and gas exploration, pharmaceutical industries and consumer applications.

Figure 1 shows a typical RFID system. There are two main components in the system, namely, RFID tags and RFID readers. An RFID tag is a tiny integrated circuit equipped with an antenna. In the presence of an RFID reader, the tag data (Electronic Product Code or EPC) is transferred to the reader. Additionally, in the RFID system, the reader connects to a middleware, which is responsible for converting raw tag data into meaningful information. It is also responsible for resolving reader collisions and for ensuring that multiple reads or bad reads are eliminated. The middleware connects to a back-end enterprise system software that utilizes and processes the information retrieved from the tags.

RFID technology is currently witnessing tremendous growth. IDTechEx estimates that the global RFID market will hit an annual investment of $5.29 billion, with IBM alone investing $250 million in the technology [2,3]. Over 10,000 RFID pilot projects are currently underway  worldwide. Many countries are piloting the use of RFID in waste management, environment, supply chain management and airport logistics. Yet, things have barely started. The RFID market is estimated to grow to about $18 billion by 2013 and to $26 billion by 2018 [2, 3, 4].

Figure 1: RFID System  EPCGlobal [5], a governing body for RFID standards worldwide is currently responsible for proposing standards for EPC to support RFID applications. EPCGlobal has envisioned an architecture called the Internet of Things in which devices with RFID tags dispersed through the Internet can communicate with each other, providing real- time information about their location, contents, destination and ambient conditions. The basic components of the architecture are shown in Figure 2. The RFID reader captures tag and sensor information through the air interface and passes it onto the RFID middleware through the reader protocol.  The middleware is responsible for data smoothing, reader coordination, data forwarding, storage and task management. Application level events for a particular EPC or a set of EPCs are activated by the middleware. These are transferred in a secure manner to networked databases.  In order to link a given EPC to the object?s database anywhere on the Internet, the architecture consists of the Object Naming Service (ONS), Discovery Services Protocols, and EPC Info Services. ONS is similar to DNS (Domain Name Service) for the traditional Internet. It essentially provides the URL for a given EPC. The architecture also proposes the use of PML (Physical Markup Language) to represent and translate static and dynamic data about the object (such as  on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing  DOI 10.1109/GreenCom-CPSCom.2010.134   on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing  DOI 10.1109/GreenCom-CPSCom.2010.134     date, time, volume, expiry, etc.) and also to develop programs to describe the behavior of the object.

II. MOTIVATION One of the biggest potential applications for the use of  RFID is in consumer businesses. It is now becoming increasingly possible to integrate RFID readers into cell phones. Nokia unveiled the world?s first cell phone with RFID reader in 2004 [6], followed by NTT DoCoMo. Many other cell phone manufacturers are looking at different application possibilities to target the consumer industry. Bae and Kim [8] describe models for consumer purchase behavior prediction. The first step in the prediction model is sampling. The data obtained is classified into different categories that are derived based on the black box model proposed by Sandhusen [7]. Liping et al propose a customer service management system [10] which integrates case-based reasoning and rule-based reasoning. Their proposed system classifies potential customers in direct marketing. Their results prove that mining of the unstructured customer purchase information which has both quantitative and qualitative information can be very useful in identifying customer purchase behavior. Similarly, Golding and Rosenbloom present a unique architecture [11] for improving rule-based systems through case based reasoning. The  central idea of their system is to use a set of rules to any given problem to obtain a default solution.

We propose a novel RFID system for use by consumer businesses in the retail sector. A common problem in any large grocery store is to make sure the customers find the right product of their choice quickly. The problem gets worse when large grocery stores hold several thousand products and when customers have time constraints; it becomes way too difficult for customers to find the required product quickly. Often customers end up not purchasing the product of their preference just because it is difficult to find and consequently this may directly impact the customer satisfaction of the store. It is also important to warn customers about product information relating to any allergies that they may have. Our proposed system analyses the customers? purchase strategies to predict the consumer behavior and provide smart customer service. Our proposal uses an RFID-enabled cell phone, which is a hybrid system that integrates the RFID technology with case-based reasoning (CBR) and rule-based reasoning (RBR) for suggesting the preferred products to customers and achieve customer satisfaction.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  Section III describes the design of the proposed system. Section IV gives an overview of the implementation. Section V provides concluding remarks.



III. PROPOSED SYSTEM Our system is an application-software running on a  mobile device such as a cell phone, blackberry, etc. In order to access this application, the customer has to set up a user account and enter his/her personal information like name, age, gender, marital status, profession, and any allergy information. Each customer will be given an ID (Cust_ID), which is mapped to their name. The collected customer information is stored in a common table called Customer Table?1, which is used for identifying and categorizing the customers (Table 1).

Table 1. Customer Table -1  The intelligent system uses the customer?s profile to categorize the customer. Here, we identify each category based on at least one or more unique features. This uniqueness is achieved by considering the age range, gender, marital or family status (single, couple, family of 3, family 4 or more), and professional status (high school student, college or university student, professional, full-time  Tag Tag Tag with sensor  Reader  Middleware  Application Level Events  Networked databases  EPC Info Services  Discovery services  ONS     employee, unemployed, homemaker).  For example, a male student, who is single and with an age range 18 to 23, will have a category ID of CC12. A female student, who is single and with the same age range will have a category ID of CC13, at the same time, a female in the same age range who is single but with an Engineering profession will have a different category ID of CC14. Allergy information is stored to make sure the suggested product is safe for the customer.

These features will define the buyers? characteristics represented in the black box model proposed by Sandhusen [7].

Our proposed system acts like a customer service staff, which understands the customers? purchase behavior and suggest the appropriate products. The customer purchase behavior is understood by the optimal use of customers? previous purchase patterns and by dynamically updating the set of rules for each customer and also for each customer category. For this purpose, we store and retrieve all the customers? purchase history in the Transaction Table (Table 2).

Table 2. Transaction Table  A. Transaction Table The transaction table acts as the source case table, which  stores all the transactions. The customer transaction table consists of information like date at which the product is purchased, ID of the customer who purchased the product and Product ID of the purchased product and the Product Category. The product ID and the product category are mapped to a Product Table (Table 3) that stores the entire information about that specific product.

B. Product Table The product table stores information like product ID,  product category, brand name, price value, quantity value, location of the product, and allergy information. Here we consider the price as Price_tag, which defines if the price of that particular branded product is low (L), medium (M) or high (H), when compared to the list of the products which fall under the same category. The quantity is Quantity_tag,  which denotes whether the preferred quantity of that product category is small (S), medium (M) or large (L); when compared to the list of products which falls under the same category. For example, if a customer?s next preferred product is Milk of quantity value M (Medium) and price value H (High), then the query searches the database for the list of products that match Pro_Cat = Milk and Price_tag = H and Quant_tag = M and it displays to a maximum of two products which has the highest weights.

Table 3. Product Table  C. Weight Calculation Weights are updated at the end of every transaction.  The  weights of the next product category that are picked are calculated based on the following formula:  P[i+1] = Pi + ((P(s,f) * Pmax) - Pi)/Pn   (1)  ? Pi : Previous or current weight of the product P[i+1]:  New weight  ? P(s,f) : Probability of success or failure (1,0) Pmax: Maximum weight = 100 Pn : Total choices of next product  P(s,f) is equal to 1 for success and 0 for failure. Every time when a customer picks one product category from the next products category list, the weight of that product increases and the weights of the rest of the product decreases when applying the above equation.

The price and quantity evaluation is done using the same weighting function. Every time a customer picks a product of particular quantity or price, the weight of that quantity or price tag will increase and the rest will decrease when applying the above formula.

D. Customer Table-2 This table (Table 4) stores all the information to support  the rule based reasoning. This table stores the primary rules for all the customers for all the products in the store. These rules are generated from the cases. In the example shown in Table 4, if the customer with ID=9000101, who belongs to the customer category CC12, picks a product category P1, then next preferred product category of highest weight is P24 and of second highest weight is P27 with a Price value of Medium (M) and quantity value of Large (L).

Table 4. Customer Table-2  In order to suggest products to the customer we need to update the rules (Customer Table -2) dynamically to make the search process faster and easier. To achieve dynamic update, we have unique tables Customer Table?3 (to identify the next two preferred products based on weights), Price Evaluation Table (for price weight evaluation), and Quantity Evaluation Table (for quantity weight evaluation).

Table 5: Customer Table-3  E. Customer Table-3 In this table (Table 5), we denote the product category as  P1, P2, P3, etc. for the sake of simplicity (example: P1 - Milk, P2 - Beverage, P3 - Sauce, etc.). In order to identify the next two preferred products based on the current picked product, we search the pervious purchase history, which will contain the total number of times a product P2, P3, etc. is picked after Product P1. Next_Pro1 stores the next preferred product which has the maximum weight (i.e. the product which is picked the most number of times after the current product). Next_Pro2 stores the second next preferred product  which has the second maximum weight (i.e. the product which is picked the second most after the current product).

The value of Next_Pro1 and Next_Pro2 will be dynamically updated in the Customer Table-2 based on the values in the Customer Table-3.

In order to calculate the weights for price and quantity for each product category we use price evaluation and quantity evaluation table.

Table 6. Price evaluation Table  Price Evaluation table (Table 6)  stores the information of each product categories? price weights for all the customers.

The weights are calculated using the weighting function mentioned before. The price value with the maximum weight for each category will be updated dynamically in the Customer Table-2.

Table 7. Quantity evaluation Table  Quantity evaluation table stores the information of each product categories? quantity weights for all the customers.

The weights are calculated similar to the quantity evaluation technique and is increased or decreased based on the number of times that particular item is purchased or rejected. The quantity value with the maximum weight for each category will be updated dynamically in the Customer Table-2.

In summary, the system initially searches for the next preferred product based on the customer personal preferences and personal purchase history, if a match is not     found, then it search the database for other customers? purchase history who fall under the same customer category of this customer. Still if there no matches are found, then we apply general association rules to identity the next preferred product. This is described in the following sub-section.

F. Association Rules In a situation, when the system cannot find similar cases  for the customer then the recommendation is done by using association rules.  Association rule mining finds interesting associations and correlation relationships among large sets of data items. Association rule mining is widely used in market based analysis. The data obtained can be used for cross selling, store layouts, etc. An association rule typically is of the form A ? B where A is an item set and B is an item set that contains only a single atomic condition. According to Bae and Kim [8]: ?The support of an association rule is the percentage of records containing item sets A and B together.

The confidence of a rule is the percentage of records containing item set A that also contain item set B?. Support here indicates the usefulness of the discovered rules and the confidence is the certainty of the detected association rule.

Table 8. Association Representation  Transaction ID  Products  TS00001 Bread, Butter, Milk  TS00002 Bread, Cheese, Eggs  TS00003 Bread, Butter, Milk, Eggs  TS00004 Bread, Butter, Milk, Eggs  TS00005 Milk, Butter, Eggs, Yogurt  TS00006 Bread, Cheese, Milk, Eggs,  Peanut Butter  Association rule mining technique finds all collections of items in a database whose confidence and support meet or exceed pre-specified threshold values. For example, Table 8 shows the results of association mining on products that included milk and bread. Zhang et al [9] propose a modified apriori algorithm for the mining of association rules. The authors use actual sales data to test the feasibility of the algorithm. For our system we intend to extract the transaction information from the transaction table and feed the data into the modified apriori algorithm [9] in order to extract the association rules.

G. Features of the Proposed System Figure 3 shows the summary flowchart of the proposed  system.

1. Detect the current product picked and display the next  product that the customer wishes to purchase.

2. Display the location (aisle) of the suggested product,  its price and quantity.

3. Display warnings if the customer is allergic to certain  products, based on the information provided by the customer on his/her profile and the product?s ingredient information.

Figure 3: Summary Flowchart  Figure 4: Typical Display on the Cell phone  As an example, Figure 4 shows that the first product picked by the customer is Bread, and the system suggests     two next preferred products (Milk and Eggs). The customer decides to purchase the Milk. However, the customer decides to pick Rice, instead of the suggested Eggs. The system automatically identifies the next preferred product after Rice and gives the right suggestion at the same time it updates the database with this new case for future recommendations.



IV. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION Figure 5 is the block diagram which explains the system  architecture. There are three major components in the system. The RFID tagged consumer product, RFID reader enabled mobile device and the backend enterprise system.

The backend enterprise system consists of the Intelligent System and the Database.  In a regular scenario, the customer walks into the store with his RFID reader enabled cell phone; he picks a product from the aisle and scans it.

The RFID reader sends the tag information along with the consumer information to the backend enterprise system for processing. The Backend enterprise system which, consists of two parts, (i) Intelligent system: Applies the rule-based and case-based reasoning to identify the preferred product.

(ii) Database: Stores the user profile information and the case base (previous purchase history) for search and processing.

Figure 5: Block Diagram of System Implementation  An RFID reader can be embedded in the mobile device like cell phone, iPhone or blackberry. The data sent by the reader is modulated and backscattered from a number of tags. Passive RFID tags are cost effective and they harvest energy from the reader?s communication signal to power up their operation and communication with the reader. The RFID reader has the capability of reading several products within a few seconds. In a typical supermarket all the products are stored in clusters, if the customer takes the RFID reader enabled cell phone near the aisle, it might read most of the products in the aisle which are in close proximity. This might be a problem in our application  because we would like the reader to read just the product picked by the customer in order to recommend the next preferred product. One way to overcome this limitation is to have the user to place the RFID reader enabled cell phone in the shopping cart and have the read range of the RFID reader limited to 10 to 15 cm. Then the customer can scan the product using the RFID enabled cell phone.



V. CONCLUSIONS We have proposed the design and implementation of an  RFID-based system for use by consumer businesses in the retail industry. Our system is able to quickly suggest products to customers based on their preferences using rule- based and case-based reasoning.

We believe the proposed technique will be more effective if it is store specific, since each store has a unique set of products and unique placement of products in the aisles. Having a store specific approach will also help the business to manage and protect their customer purchase history. The proposed technique can be extended for applications like the library system, pharmaceuticals, air and rail ticket booking system, etc., where the customer will have regular and similar purchase behaviors. The intelligent system will be more effective if we have more customer purchase information, which will help us to clearly understand and get accurate weights for the behaviors. Since RFID technology is still in early implementation stages, we need to consider security issues and traffic congestion issues before implementing it. We would like to test the data to find the accuracy level in each metric like price, quantity and order choice. We are also looking for more hybrid techniques to identify similarity of the patterns in the long- term purchase behavior and short-term purchase behavior and also to identify any change in the purchase behavior based on seasons or other social aspects.
