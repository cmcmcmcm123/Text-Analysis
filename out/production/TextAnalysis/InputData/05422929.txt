I.  INTRODUCTION  Data Mining (DM) is the process of automated extraction of interesting data patterns representing knowledge, implicitly stored (embedded or hidden) in large databases, the web, other massive data repositories, or data streams [1, 2]. Patterns are extracted using tools such as classification, association rules, clustering, etc.

A huge amount of transactional data, a.k.a. basket data, is available in the retail industry due to advancement in bar code technology where a customer?s purchase order is stored per transaction basis [3]. Frequent itemsets are the itemsets that appear in a data set frequently. Finding such frequent itemsets plays an essential role in mining associations, correlations, and many other interesting relationships among itemsets in transactional and relational databases. Frequent Itemset mining is a core DM task. It has an elegantly simple problem statement: to find the set of all subsets of items that frequently occur together in database records or transactions. Although this task has a simple statement, it is CPU and input/output (I/O) intensive, mainly because the large amount of itemsets that are typically generated and large size of the datasets involved in the process[2,4,5].

Mining the Association rules from the frequent itemsets requires a transactional database which can be a real transactional data base of any retail industry or can be a synthetic version generated by a tool. Synthetic Data Set  generated by a tool can server a fundamental requirement for experimenting with the DM concepts and mining the Association rules from the frequent itemsets. Newly designed algorithms can be experimented and tested on such synthetic data sets and then the concepts can be implemented on a real data set [8].

This paper presents an designed and implemented algorithm, SAR (Strong Association Rule), to check whether an Association Rule (AR) is strong enough or not. Apriori algorithm is also implemented to generate Frequent k-itemsets.

A Binary Transactional Dataset [8] is used for implementing the algorithm in java language  Rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the definitions and preliminary concepts; Section 3 describes the SAR algorithm. Implementation and performance of the algorithm is shown in Section 4 and finally article is concluded in Section 5.



II. DEFINITIONS AND PRELIMINARIES  The frequent itemset mining can be formally defined as follows:  TDS ?  Transactional Database  D ?  total number of transactions in TDS  or size of TDS  I = { }miii ,,, 21 ? ?  set of m items in TDS  t ?  A transaction (tuple) in TDS .Each transaction is assigned an identifier called TID.

P ?  A set of items (itemset or pattern) in a particular transaction t , IP ? . An itemset P  containing k items is called k-itemset.

)(Ps  : Support of an itemset P  is the frequency of  occurrence of P  in TDS  )(Ps  = D  Pcontainingtof ____# %,       Transactional  Data Set  Candidate -1 Itemset  Generator Itemset     Sup count  Candidate -1 Itemset  Frequent -1 Itemset  Generator min_sup  Itemset     Sup count  Frequent -1 Itemset  All Frequent Itemsets  Reservior  JOINER Candidate Itemset  Generator  Itemset     Sup count  Intermediate  Candidate Itemset  SUBSET  TESTER  Itemset     Sup count  Candidate Itemset  Prior Knowledge  (Apriori Property)  Frequent Itemset  Generator  Itemset     Sup count  Frequent  Itemset min_sup    Figure 1.

min_sup: given minimum support threshold.

Frequent Itemsets?  Frequent itemsets are the itemsets that  appear in a data set frequently. and satisfy the minimum  support(min_sup) ,i.e. itemset P  is frequent if )(Ps ? min_sup.

kC ?  Candidate frequent k-Itemsets is the list (or set) of all  frequent k-itemsets without the constraint of minimum support threshold, min_sup.

kL ?  List (or set) of frequent k-itemsets after pruning the  candidate set kC  by applying the constraint of min_sup.

Antimontone downward closure property of Frequent Itemsets?  if a set cannot pass a test, all of its supersets will  fail the same test as well, i.e., all nonempty subsets of a frequent itemset must also be frequent, i.e., any (k-1)-itemset  that is not frequent cannot be a subset of a frequent k-itemset.

This property is used in subset testing of frequent itemsets.

Apriori Algorithm?  Apriori is most popular and basic  algorithm proposed by R. Agrawal and R. Srikant [6] for mining frequent itemsets for generating boolean association rules. Apriori exploits the basic functionality of a frequent itemset: all subsets of a frequent itemset must be frequent.

Starting with singleton itemsets, Apriori computes their supports by scanning the database, and filters out frequent itemsets. At the end of each iteration, only itemsets whose immediate subsets are all frequent at the current iteration are considered at the next iteration.

We have also implemented Apriori algorithm in java language. Figure 1 shows the block architecture of the Apriori implementation. Transactional Data Set (TDS) contains items purchased per transaction basis. Candidate-1 Itemset Generator generates Candidate-1 itemset with support count. Frequent-1 Itemset Generator prunes Candidate-1 itemset with the constraints of given minimum threshold support count, i.e., min_sup and generates Frequent-1 itemset which also is  2010 IEEE 2nd International Advance Computing Conference 343    stacked in All Frequent Itemset Reservoir (AFIR). AFIR is used to supply the prior knowledge to the Subset Tester. In each level wise iteration JOINER joins the Frequent Itemset List then Candidate Itemset Generator generates Intermediate Candidate Itemset with support count. Subset Tester generates all the non empty subsets for every itemset in Intermediate Candidate Itemset. If any of subset is not frequent in previous list (Prior Knowledge from AFIR) and a resultant Candidate Itemset is generated for that iteration which is then pruned by Frequent Itemset Generator for generating Frequent Itemset List with the constraints of min_sup. This list is stacked to AFIR and also given to JOINER for the next iteration. This process is repeated till an empty Frequent Itemset list is obtained.

Association Rule(AR) ?  An implication of the form  QP ? , where itemset IP ? , itemset IQ ? , and  ?=QP ? . Itemset P  is the antecedent part and itemset Q is called the  consequent part of AR.

Association Rules first introduced in [3], are used to discover the associations (or co-occurrences) among items in a transactional database. ARs can be used to find the patterns of customer?s purchase such as how the transaction of buying some goods will impact on the transactions of buying others.

Such rules can be implemented to design the merchandise shelves, to manage the stock and to classify the customers according to the purchase patterns. Support and confidence are two measures to find interesting Association Rules.

Support, s, of an AR is the probability that the transaction contains both antecedent and consequent of AR and  is given as:  )( QPs ? =  D  QandPbothcontainingTof _______# %, we  can say that %s  of the transactions support the rule QP ? ,  0.10 ?? s  or %100%0 ?? s  Confidence, c, of an AR is the conditional probability that a transaction having antecedent also contains consequent of AR and is given as:  )( QPc ? = )(  )(  Ps  QPs ? = sup_count( QP ? ) /  sup_count( P ), we can say that when itemset P  occurs in a transaction there are %c  chances that itemset Q  will occur in  that transaction, 0.10 ?? c  or %100%0 ?? c  min_conf?  given minimum confidence threshold  Strong AR ?  if ?? )( QPs min_sup &&  ?? )( QPc min_conf, then rule QP ?  is called strong AR.

Association Rule Mining (ARM) ?  ARM is the task to  find all the strong association rules whose support and  confidence are above the min_sup and min_conf, respectively.

The ARM can be viewed as a two-step process[7].
