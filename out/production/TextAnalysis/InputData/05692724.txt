A Study on the Method of Mobile Content Recommendation Based on Situations

Abstract?In existing mobile content service systems, the study is quite rare on automatic situation-service rule construction. Hence, a method is proposed that the semantic association rules between situations and preferences are built by quantitative frequent marked lattice. Different recommendation rules can be extracted along multi- dimensional context routes from this lattice structure. It is propitious to solve the problems of rule collisions and availability of context data. The algorithm is studied for frequent marked lattice construction and the priority is designed for rule extraction. Finally, the advantage and feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated by a calculating instance.

I. INTRODUCTION Mobile content recommendation means to deliver the  related contents to the users proactively based on users? preferences, locations, behavior habits, etc. The contexts are crucial issues that are used to characterize the situations of mobile users[1]. Effective utilization of context information makes it feasible to provide the right contents for the right users in the right situations, and thus enhances the quality and utility of recommendation [2].

In recent years, many models and frameworks have  been introduced for context-aware pervasive services.

Ontology-based models are widely adopted in this domain because of the supporting capability of knowledge sharing and logical reasoning. However, the reasoning rules are predefined manually in most systems such as the projects of CoBrA[3], SOCAM[4], FLAME2008[5]. Generally, the relationship between user preferences and situations can not be recognized simply and clearly, and as a result, the predefined rules are short of flexibility and accuracy.

Aiming at this problem, some solutions have been  proposed about automated learning mechanism in the last two years. Choi et al.[6] adopt information entropy to calculate dependency between preferences and contexts, however, their method can not dispose the semantic problems. Bai et al.[7] proposed an ontology-based case-based reasoning model, deriving corresponding service rules by computing the similarity between actual situations and situation cases. However, there is no detailed explanation on case library construction in learning process. Kwon et al.[8] utilize concept lattice to produce recommendation rules, but they only consider the correlation between services and single dimension of contexts.

The research is still rare on machine learning approaches in context-aware service domain. Moreover, the situation-service rules are taken as certain rules in related works. To improve the antinoise ability of rules in actual applications, association rules are more suitable to describe the relations between preferences and situations.

In this paper, we focus on semantic association rule  mining between situations and preferences through quantitative frequent marked lattice(QFML). Dynamic contexts are taken as the factors to describe the situations of mobile users. The main tasks include: impact identification of various contexts on preferences, relationship establishment between preference sets and situation sets, and rule extraction according to different conditions. The rest of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the ontology models involved. The method of rule mining and extracting through QFML is demonstrated in Section 3. The advantage and feasibility of the proposed method is illustrated by a calculating instance in Section 4. The conclusion and future work is covered in the last section.



II. ONTOLOGIES FOR MOBILE CONTENT RECOMMENDATION  An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization[9]. The situation-preference ontology model is an explicit description of user preferences, situations and the relations between them. Its target is to construct a common and extendable semantic model for knowledge sharing and reuse among distributed and heterogeneous agents or systems.

A. Relationship between Preferences and Situations The situation-preference ontology model is described  in Fig. 1.

Figure 1. Situation-preference ontology model  The model includes four basic concepts(Classes) of user, preference, context and situation. The relations of these concepts are defined as transitive ObjectProperty in OWL. Context is treated as a bridge role to connect  2010 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design  DOI 10.1109/ISCID.2010.94   2010 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design  DOI 10.1109/ISCID.2010.94     Preference with Situation because different preferences do not depend on situations directly, but depend on different dimensional contexts such as time, location. Different contexts are defined as the subclass of Context, and moreover, the restriction is given that there is no intersection among concept sets of different contexts for subsequent collision detection and matchmaking. Degrees of preference and dependency are defined as Datatype Property in OWL. Figure 2 shows the OWL description segment in Fig. 1.

Figure 2. The OWL description segment  Situation may be expressed as a set of property-value pairs: Situation={c1:V1;c2:V2?cn:Vn}, where cj means ?has_cj_Property? and is modeled as subProperty of ?describedBy? in Fig. 2. If Vj is defined as the concept in context ontology, a semantic situation is formed which corresponds to a cluster of situation instances in raw historical records. Preferences are used to describe content subjects that users are interested in and a preference class also corresponds to a cluster of contents.

B. Hierarchy of Content Services and Contexts According to the requirements in different problem  domains, raw data need to be mapped into the different concept levels of corresponding ontologies. An example of concept hierarchy is given in Fig. 3.

Figure 3. Hierarchy model of contents and contexts  S denotes content service class and C denotes context class. S1,S2,S3 denote the classes of Game, News, Music;  C1,C11,C12 denote: DailyTime, DayTime, NightTime; C2,C22 denote: Location, SportsPlace; C3,C31,C32 denote: Weather, GoodWeather and BadWeather. The shaded areas and connecting line present that a mobile user has the content preferences of {S21=SportsNews; S31=Pop- Music; S32=ClassicalMusic} in Situation1={c1:C113= (16:30-17:30)Period; c2:C221=Playground; c3:C31=Good- Weather}; and Situation2={c1:C122=(19:00-21:00)Period; c2:C222=Gymnasium; c3:C31=BadWeather}.

Situation set is composed of the situations corresponding to the same preference set. In the course of situation-preference association rule mining, the core task is to build the relationship between situation sets and preference sets.



III. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING BETWEEN SITUATIONS AND PREFERENCES  The Galois lattice theory[10] provides a concise, complete and visualized approach for knowledge representation. It is widely used in the domains of data mining, knowledge engineering and information retrieval, etc. Based on the models above, an approach is proposed to build the relationship between situations and preferences by QFML. It is convenient to extract different rules and contributes to reduce computing complexity.

A. Preprocessing Raw data cannot be used by system directly due to  their sparsity. The first task in preprocessing is turning the raw data into the ontological concepts by mapping mechanism, merging the same records and keeping down their counts.

Various contexts do not have the same impact on  users? preferences. Moreover, too many contexts not only increase computing complexity, but also hamper clear and concise decision making. Then, it is necessary to reduce some context dimensions according to their importance.

The second task is to get the service count table mnCS under different context concepts, and then to derive the dependency matrix. The element CSjki in mnCS denotes the count of content service class Si under the kth concept of context Cj . The relations between preferences and contexts may be weighed by information entropy[6].

The calculating formula is given by (1):  ? ?  ? k  1c cc  j i klogplogpH , ?  ? ?  k  1c  jc i  jc ic CSCSp . (1)  The dependency matrix may be defined as m n  m n HIDS -? , where I is unit matrix. Setting threshold  to mnDS , the unimportant contexts are reduced. Then, setting minimum support count to mnCS , the reduced Frequent Marked Context (FMC) is obtained. The FMC is different from conventional formal context because its rows denote frequent classes instead of objects and its columns denote frequent attributes of the classes.

B. Relationship Establishment After preprocessing procedure, the conceptualized  record table and the reduced FMC are obtained. They are inputs for situation-prefenrence association rules mining.

Definition 3.1[11]: Let B)(A,=C1 is a concept in Galois lattice L , B),A(=C2 is called quantitative concept of  1C , A denotes the cardinality of A . If A satisfies the minimum support count, 1C is called frequent concept, and iB (i =1,2, 3?k) is basic frequent item in B .

Definition 3.2: If there is a frequent subset S in the object set of )B,A(=C , then )B,S(CFM ? is defined as frequent marked concept of C . FMC is derived from other knowledge different from attribute knowledge in L . The structure QFML is called Quantitative Frequent Marked Lattice (QFML), which is composed of quantitative concepts and their frequent marked concept sets  B)),S|,SSet(|,A( ii .

The method for establishing the situation-preference  association by QFML is described as follows: Using FMC as a reference, the lattice is built layer by  layer from top to bottom, increasing a combined dimension of contexts for each layer of lattice. The key problem forming a node is to examine whether there are frequent service subsets in the object set of the Cartesian Product of multidimensional contexts. The top-down method is convenient to prune the redundant nodes rapidly.

It is necessary to clarify that the FMC only plays a  reference role, and QFML construction does not depend on it completely. The reason is that a super-concept is frequent, but its sub-concepts may not be frequent, not to mention that the sub-concepts have frequent marked concept sets. The FMC is used for bitVector conjunction calculation. For example, there is a FMC as Tab.1:  TABLE I. EXAMPLE OF FMC  C11 C12 C21 C22 C31 C32  S1 1 0 0 1 0 0  S2 0 1 1 1 0 1  The bitVectors of context concepts are as follows: V[C11]=10; V[C12]=01; V[C21]=01; V[C22]=11; V[C31]=00; V[C32]=01.

Since V[C11]&V[C21]=00, the combined attributes (C11C21) can not form the node in QFML. However, to the combined attributes (C12C22C32), V[C12]&V[C22]&V[C32]=01; they need further calculating and judging. BitVector conjunction calculation can improve the efficiency of QFML construction.

C. Recommendation Rules Extraction According to different conditions, different rules need  to be extracted from QFML. If the situation is known, situation-service rules need to be extracted; and if the content is known, service-situaion rules need to be extracted. Formula (2) is adopted to calculate the  semantic similarity of various contexts, content preferences respectively.

))B(Sup)A(Sup(Card ))B(Sup)A(Sup(Card  =)B,A(Sim ?  ? . (2)  }XA,OX|X{=)A(Sup denotes the super-concept set in the corresponding ontology O ; )?(Card denotes the cardinality of set.

Because the nodes of deeper layer in QFML include  more context dimensions, the rules derived from the deeper nodes are endowed with higher priority. If the layers of nodes are the same, the support( ? ) and confidence( ? ) parameters will be compared for rule priority. After rule extraction procedure, the priority- ranked rule set is acquired. The flow chart for rule extraction is described in Fig. 4.

Figure 4. Flow chart of rule extraction procedure  The advantage of the mothed proposed in this paper is that the situations and preferences can be searched along respective routes. The rules extracted from QFML are frequent, and the relevant parameters can be obtained directly. Furthermore, it is feasible to search situations along different context dimensions. If some context data can not be acquired in time or their precision and reliability can not reach a given standard, some useful rules may still be acquired for recommendation.



IV. CASE STUDY A calculating instance is given in this section. The raw  data are obtained from observation of user behaviors.

Taking the historical records of a mobile user in a month as calculating data, we get 32 count records via clustering 49 raw record data to ontological concepts. The frequent context-preference count table is listed in Tab.2 (min_supp_count=4).

Figure 5. Hasse diagram of QFML  3) Recommendation rules extraction a) Assuming that the pending content is similar to S1  after semantic matching, the rule set and ( ? , ? ) parameters from different layer are derived as follows: Layer1[#2,#3,#7]: #2-Rule: pref=S1??????1; (8.16% , 25%) #3-Rule: pref=S1??????2; (16.33%, 50%) #7-Rule: pref=S1?? l=L3; (18.37%, 56.25%)  Layer2[#8,#9]: #8-Rule: pref=S1??????1^l=L3; (8.16%, 25%) #9-Rule: pref=S1??????2^l=L3; (10.2% , 31.25%) Adoping the priority designed in Section 3.3, the prior  order of rules is: Rule#9>Rule#8>Rule#7>Rule#3>Rule #2. It means: if the content relevant to Financial news is sent to the user, the best situation will be Situation= {t:(11:30-13:30)Period; l:DwellingPlace} (Rule#9) b) Assuming that the current situation of mobile user  is Situation={t:T1;l:L2;w:W2} after similarity computing.

Since w:W2 is reduced by support and dependency paramaters, it only needs to search {t:T1; l:L2}.

Layer1[#2,#5]: #2-Rule: t=T1???? ???1; (8.16%, 50%) #5-Rule-1: l=L2???? ???2; (8.16%, 30.77%) #5-Rule-2: l=L2???? ???3; (12.24%, 46.15%) There is no node in Layer2 which satisfies the  condition that its attribute set is the subset of {t:T1; l:L2}, so no recommendation should be performed. Otherwise, we may select the rules derived from the nodes in Layer1  according to ( ? ,? ) parameters, or decrease the threshold of similarity to get more context concepts and perform a new search in QFML.



V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, an approach is proposed in which  ontology and FCA are used together for semantic association rules mining between preferences and situations. The proposed QFML structure reduces needed node number. It is propitious to extract different rules along respective routes and to calculate relevant parameters. The priority of rules is designed and discussed. In preprocessing procedure, the method of context reduction is different from the reduction methods based on attribute dependency in related works. In future work, integration of different reduction methods will be studied to solve the problem about combinatorial explosion of context attributes. It is also necessary to study the incremental construction algorithm to implement dynamic updating of QFML.
