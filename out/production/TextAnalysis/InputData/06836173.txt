Ground Vehicle Doppler Geolocation  Hanna Witzgall

Abstract-This paper reports on the performance of a  recently developed particle filter technique to locate a  stationary push-to-talk (PTT) radio using the Doppler?  shifted signal as observed by a single moving ground vehicle.

The primary difficulty for single-sensor Doppler-based  localization is that the solution is strongly dependent on the  target's unknown original carrier frequency. This  uncertainty allows many possible location estimates to  correspond with the observations. Furthermore, the PTT  carrier is observed to drift significantly over short time  periods. This creates a dynamic, multi modal objective  function and motivates the application of the particle filter  solution. The technique's performance is demonstrated on  real data collected by a slow-moving (10-40 mph) ground vehicle over a relatively short 0.5 km range. The location accuracies achieved are compared to the theoretical  frequency of arrival (FOA) Cramer-Rao Lower Bound  (CRLB) and with the more common two sensor frequency  difference of arrival (FDOA) solution.
