An Efficient Approach for Web-Log Mining Using ART

Abstract?Information on the Web is growing dramatically.

Without a recommended system, the users may spend lots of time on the Web in finding the information they are interested in [5]. With the Web becoming the most popular media for collecting, sharing, and distributing information, it is very common for educational institutions, and organizations to develop Web-Based Training (WBT) systems [6]. Data mining in Web log known as Web-log mining or Web mining has been a hot spot of research work. Many Web mining methods based on association rule [1] have been proposed. Data on the Web is really unstructured, and implementation of association rule has some limitation. Overcome of these limitation can be done with neuro-fuzzy approach but without optimization. In this paper, we present a novel technique for Web-log mining using ART (Adaptive Resonance Network), and compare it with neuro-fuzzy approach.

I. INTRODUCTION  With the explosive development of Internet, data mining in Web log, which is called ?Web mining?, has been a hot spot of research work. The process of Web mining is to derive implied information of Web user?s behavior from huge Web data repositories [1].  Web data usually exhibits the following characteristics [9]: the data on the Web is huge in amount, distributed, heterogeneous, unstructured, and dynamic.

Figure 1.  Basic Mining Techniques.

Web log mining belongs to Web usage mining, it discovers the mode of user visiting Web page by mining  Web log, recognizes user?s faith degree, taste, satisfaction degree by analyzing the rules in the log, discovers potential users, enhances service compete capability of the Web site [3]. The results of Web-log mining can be applied to enhance Web services.

The main contribution of this paper is a Web-mining approach for Web-log analysis via introducing ART structure for huge, widely distributed, highly heterogeneous, semi-structured, interconnected, evolving, hypertext information repository of World Wide Web. So, the Web sites automatically improve their organization and presentation by self-learning.

The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we describe previous work in field of Web-mining; in section 3, we discuss about Web-log; in section 4, we discuss about ART1 in detail with its algorithm flowchart, and proposed results; and finally in section 5, we focus on conclusion, and future-work.



II. PREVIOUS WORK  Previous work in field of Web log mining is done using different techniques like simple search operation on Web log, clustering or categorization of Web log using some algorithms that organize information into groups based on similarity function or by using some predefined set of rules, analyze the log (discover knowledge), and knowledge management.

The contribution of understanding Internet user?s behavior, and identification of relevant pattern is the benefit to predict, and prefetch Web object in Web caching [7]. An intelligent Web caching architecture, capable of adapting its behavior on the basis of the access patterns of the client sheers. Such usage patterns, or models, are extracted from the historical access data recorded in log files, by means of data mining techniques [8]. Semantic Web log model [3], SWLM based on ontologies to interpret properties of Web log, then computing the semantic distances of log concepts.

Hybrid Information Filtering Model [5] collects user interest pages, constructs user interest model, and implements content-based filtering [5, 12] on the basis of Web log mining. Integer program [13] groups log registers from the same IP address, and ensuring the link structure of the site is followed in any constructed session. It does not construct the sessions one at a time but instead simultaneously constructs all sessions. Fuzzy Immunity Clonal Selection Neural Network [10] in which fuzzy association rule is extracted by the Immunity Clonal Selection Neural Network algorithm, after; rule set is applied on a dataset, and to      evaluate working performance of the algorithm. The fuzzy multiset [12] is adopted to characterize user?s navigation behavior, and to construct a multi fuzzy similar matrix to represent similarity between different users? browsing behavior, which can reflect wholly the interest of Web user with the Web page-click rate, Web page viewing time, user's preference, and so on.



III. WEB LOG  A log from a Web server (Web log) contains records of users? browsing activities, and is a potentially large source of data on customer preferences [14]. Important information [1, 4] of every single access is recorded as Web log entry by Web servers, including the URL requested, the source IP address, remote host name, log-name, user name, request, status, bytes, and timestamp as:  ? remote host: remote hostname or IP address ? log-name: remote log-name of the user ? user name: user name with which the user has  authenticated himself ? date: date, and time of the request ? request: exact request line as it came from the client ? status: HTTP status code returned to the client ? bytes: content-length of the document transferred  Web mining techniques have been applied to extract usage patterns from Web log data. This process, known as Web usage mining, is traditionally performed in several stages [1] to achieve its goals as following:  1. Collection of Web data in an activity of recording Web-log in Web server.

2. Preprocessing of Web data such as filtering crawlers requests, requests to graphics, and identifying unique sessions.

3. Analysis of Web data is to discover interesting usage patterns or profiles.

4. Interpretation/evaluation of the discovered profiles.

Figure 2. Basic Structure of ART.

There are several general challenges [6] associated with obtaining due results from the data. Firstly, extraneous information is mixed with useful one, for example log  entries that record the request failures, page graphics, etc.

are irrelevant to our current analysis. Secondly, multiple server requests may be generated by a single user action.

Thirdly, multiple user actions may generate the same server request. Fourth, local activities (for example browser navigation using ?back?, and ?forward? buttons) are not recorded.



IV. ART ART architecture models can self-organize in real time  producing stable recognition while getting input patterns beyond those originally stored. ART is a family of different neural architectures. The most basic architecture is ART1 (Carpenter, and Grossberg, 1987). ART1 can learn, and recognize binary patterns. ART2 (Carpenter, and Grossberg, 1987) is a class of architectures categorizing arbitrary sequences of analog input patterns. ART is used in modeling such as invariant visual pattern recognition where biological equivalence is discussed in 1990.

An ART system consists of two subsystems, an attention-subsystem, and an orienting subsystem (fig. 2).

The stabilization of learning, and activation occurs in the attention-subsystem by matching bottom-up input activation, and top-down expectation. The orienting subsystem controls the attention-subsystem when a mismatch occurs in the attention-subsystem. In other words, the orienting subsystem works like a novelty detector.

A. Properties of ART An ART system has four basic properties.

1. Self-scaling computational units. The attention- subsystem is based on competitive learning enhancing pattern features but suppressing noise.

2. Self-adjusting memory search. The system can search memory in parallel, and adaptively change its search order.

3. Already learned patterns directly access their corresponding category.

4. The system can adaptively ovulate attentional vigilance using the environment as a teacher. If the environment disapproves the current recognition of the system, it changes this parameter to be more vigilant.

B. ART-1 There are two models of ART-1, a slow-learning, and a  fast-learning one. The slow learning model is described by in terms of differential equations while the fast learning model uses the results of convergence in the slow learning model.

ART-1 is the first version of ART-based networks proposed by Carpenter, and Grossberg. The network was intended for unsupervised clustering of binary data. It has two major subsystems: attention-subsystem, and orienting subsystem. The attention-subsystem is a one layer neural network. It has D input neurons to learn D-dimensional data, and C output neurons to map C maximum clusters. Initially all output neurons are uncommitted. Once an output neuron      learned from a pattern, it becomes committed. The activation function is computed at all committed output neurons. The input, and output is connected by both top- down, and bottom-up weights.

C. Algorithm ART1 algorithm uses following parameters as:  ? n: number of components in the input vector.

? m: maximum number of clusters that can be formed.

? bij: bottom-up weights (from F1(b) unit Xi to F2  unit Yj).

? tji: top-down weights (from F2 unit Yj to F1 unit Xi).

? ?: vigilance parameter.

? s: binary input vector (an n-tuple).

? x: activation vector for F1 (b) layer (binary).

? ?x?: norm of vector x, defined as the sum of the  components xi.

The algorithm of ART1 is as following: Step 0. Initialize parameters:  L > 1 0 < ? ? 1 Initialize weights: 0 < bij(0) < L / L- 1 + n tji(0) = 1.

Step 1. While stopping condition is false, do Steps 2-13.

Step2. For each training input, do steps 3-12.

Step 3. Set activation of all F2 units to zero.

Set activations of F1(a) units to input vector s.

Step 4. Compute the norm of s:  ?s?= ? si Step 5. Send input signal from F1(a) to the F1(b)  layer: Xi = si.

Step 6. For each F2 node that is not inhibited: If yj ? -1, then  Yj = ? bij*xi Step 7. While reset is true, do step 8-11.

Step 8. Find J such that yJ ? yj for all nodes j.

If yj = -1, then all nodes are inhibited and this pattern                                                         can not be clustered.

Step 9. Recompute activation x of F1(b): Xi = si*tji.

Step 10. Compute the norm of vector x: ?x? = ? xi  Step 11. Test for reset: If ?x? / ?s? < ?, then  Yj = -1 (inhibited node J) If ?x? / ?s? ? ?, then  proceed to Step 12.

Step 12. Update the weights for node j (fast learning): bij(new) = L*xi / L-1 + ?x?, tji (new) = xi  Step 13. Test for stopping condition.

Algorithm?s parameters are initialized as following:  TABLE 1.  INITIALIZATION OF ALGORITHM PARAMETERS.

Parameter   Permissible Range   Sample Value  L L > 1 2 ? 0 < ? ? 1 0.8 bij 0 < bij(0) < L / L ? 1 + n 1 / 1 + n tji   tji (0) = 1                                  1  D. Proposed Results If any Web-mining researches apply this ART1, then can  easily obtained best result than any implemented Web- mining techniques because of vigilance parameter, top- down, and bottom-up weights. This technique also generates clusters for all hours of a day (fig. 4), clusters for all days of a week, histogram analysis for hours-days within day-month respectively (fig. 5).

Also using ART, it is more beneficiary to minimize the number of steps in Web mining as compare to neuro-fuzzy approach. As neuro-fuzzy approach uses five major steps to produce the Web-usage pattern forecast, and Web-usage data analyzer; named Web-log data collection, data preprocessing, self-organizing map, Web-usage data cluster, and fuzzy inference system (fig. 6). But ART use only three steps as Web-log data collection, data preprocessing, and ART itself (fig. 7).

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Web log mining is the combination of Web technology,  and data mining technology. In this paper, we suggest adaptive analysis method for Web-log which helps in designing Web-sites, analysis human Web behavior.

Because of huge amount of Web-log, it is infeasible to classify them by hand, so by using ART model, we can analyze them in supervised learning.

Another variant of ART produces better result than this one. So, any one can pick this idea, and implement both, and can analyze their results. In future, ART can also be implemented with all previous techniques like semantic Web log, hybrid information filtering, fuzzy immunity clonal selection neural network, and fuzzy multiset to build Multi-pass ART, and provide more efficient result.
