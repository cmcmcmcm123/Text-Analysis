Intelligent Agent Based Talent Evaluation Engine using a Knowledge Base

Abstract?In the current age of recession, Human Resource department of every organization is facing a real challenging task of recruiting right talent peoples who can do the project in different problem domain and complete it within timeline. The main responsibility of any HR Personnel is to propose right talent pool to the interviewers to save their time in selecting the right talent for their organization. In the talent pool set up phase, HR faces the problem of making a decision whether to include the applicant into talent pool or not. Many HR Tools are available to support the decision making of HR Personnel. However, the accuracy of decision making still can not satisfy the HR personnel. Here, we proposed a two tier intelligent based architecture consisting of talent evaluation engine that acts on knowledge base constituted by domain experts and infers the pattern needed to make more consistent and accurate decision. Also, we implemented the intelligent resume processing method which is really helpful in making a decision more perfect. The practical implementation of our system shows that accuracy of talent evaluation is very much improved. Our proposed system increases the job performance, reduces retention failure and explicit resignation.

I.  LITERATURE SURVEY   With the increasing number of job portals, it become mandatory for the HR personnel to use more accurate talent evaluation applications for finding right workforce to their company. For any business, it is very important to have competitive multi talented workforce human resource for tackling any economic challenges. Most of the talent evaluation applications are based on the data mining [1][2], fuzzy clustering [3], neuro and rough set theory[5].

However, it is difficult for HR personnel to use these methods at early stage of selection. Any wrong decision of HR, the selection may go wrong and can add up wasted training expenses for the company. Recently, a number of studies have been proposed to evaluate the talent of applicant and recruit the people for the right job based on the evaluation. We have conducted investigation on talent evaluation systems and architecture that can be matched with our proposed system. A HR talent evaluation system [1] is constructed by integrating the data mining methods such as association rule and decision tree. Most of the association rules are inferred from the available facts in database. Sometimes a valid association rule may be missed due to poor support and confidence for that rule. Hybrid data mining technique [3] [6] has been adopted in semiconductor manufacturing for solving engineering and  yield problem. Only few studies have been done for talent evaluation. Other than the data mining such as neural network, support vector machine and statistical methods [4] are block boxes to the decision makers. This type of system is not particularly useful for the human resource management application  .



II. DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF TWO TIER INTELLIGENT AGENT BASED ARCHITECTURE   According to different functionality, our proposed  architecture can be divided into two main phase Back End (Figure 1) and Front End (Figure 2).

A.Back End Phase of Architecture:  Two main major modules of the Back End phases are Data pre processing and pattern mining. In this phase, we perform Data preprocessing and mining on employee profile of company to capture well known pattern and after that we enrich the patterns as well as add the valid additional rules with the help of domain expert. For any job posting by the recruiter, HR domain expert prepares the valid rules based on his/her expert knowledge and also from the inferred pattern. These valid rules need to be matched with the applicant.

1.Data Preprocessing: Mostly human resource data are sensitive and  stored in different place. Before performing the mining, data preprocessing is required to ensure rich quality data.1.Data Selection: We selected the data from the employee profile for assisting the mining. Our mining targets the three important attributes.

Figure 1 Back End Phase  Knowledge Base  Knowledge Elicitation  Job Posting HR Domain Experts and Mined Pattern  Data Preprocessing  Profiles   DOI 10.1109/ARTCom.2009.214    DOI 10.1109/ARTCom.2009.214    DOI 10.1109/ARTCom.2009.214     They are performance of employee, retention failure and explicit resignation. We select the data and load it in the schema show in Table 1 .2. Data Cleaning: We excluded the attribute such as age, gender and martial status to avoid discrimination of employees from profile schema. 3. Data Enrichment: College attribute of Profile is enriched by categorizing the studied colleges into A, B and C category.4.Data Transformation: We used the relational table format which confines to the schemas in Table 1 for loading the data. We have developed the performance review component in our system. It analysis the each employees based on the performance attributes such as technical expertise, Team working behavior and interest in knowledge improvement. This component generates the grade value for each employee and stores it in the Performance schema. A retention rate is a critical issue since most of the companies invest a lot on new employee.

According to HR experience, if one employee quits the job within 6 months of probation period then recruitment process is failed and investment training is wasted. We prepared the profile of employee who left the company within 1 year. We recorded reason for the retention failure in the Retention schema. When company employee resigns the job explicitly as of his own, The HR and immediate manager of that employee should interview him and record reason such as internal exit or external pull in the explicit schema.

2. HR Domain Experts and Mined Pattern:  In the mining step of Back End Phase, We applied association rule mining on the loaded data by joining the different schemas. Association rule is the correlation between one set of item with another set of item. During the Association rule mining, candidate rule discovered should satisfy the minimum support of 85% and confidence of 65%.If any candidate rule comes close to support then it is given to domain expert for validation.

A java based data mining system is developed to implement the data mining alogirthm.We used Apriori algorithm to analyze all the dataset. Excerpts of interesting patterns inferred from the loaded data source using our method are shown below. By joining the performance and profile schema, we can derive a good employee profile as in the rule1 with excellent support and confidence. With the help of knowledge elicitation component, all the mined rules and domain expert contributed rules are translated into prolog notation form and added to knowledge base. The observed piece of evidence can be stored as prolog facts.

B. Front End Phase of Architecture: In the Front End phase of our system as shown in Fig.2,  job seeker submits the resume to tagger. it converts the resume to XML tagged resume and all facts extracted from tagged resume are loaded into knowledge base. When a HR Query is received, our Talent Evaluation Inference Engine (TEIE) runs the applicant facts against the rule base formulated in the knowledge base by the Back End. TEIE captures the candidate based on the valid match count and suggest a list to HR Personnel.1.Tagger: It?s is an intelligent resume processing component that acts on the applicant resume and generates the XML tagged resume which is confined to the tagged resume XML DTD.

XQUERY are executed on XML tagged resume to do the Knowledge Elicitation.2.Talent Evaluation Inference Engine: The main role of the IEIE is to evaluate each applicant resume against already built knowledge base and choose the applicants who attain the maximum number of matches. We formulate the rule base gathered from mining and domain expert in such a way that each applicant resume checked against the rule.TEIE is designed to infer the facts following Top down inference mechanism. Additionally, Job seeker can post query to TEIE to find right job opening match to their resume. InterProlog provides Java with the ability to call any prolog goal through a prolog object and for prolog to invoke any java method through a java message predicate.

III DATA ANALYSIS REPORT   Our proposed online base system was examined on Vee  Technologies company dataset which is affiliated to our college. We tested our Back End of the system on total of 510 employees who hired from Jan 2006 to Dec 2008. We traced their performance, retention failures and explicit resignation to explore rules. These rules are enriched with the help of domain expert and constructed more precise knowledge base. Here, the Performance of talent evaluation analyzed based on accuracy of talent pool, improvement of  Figure 2.

In Vee Technologies, job seekers need to go through 3 level of interview such as technical, group discussion and HR  Accuracy = Level  Level  Original OriginalLevelP ?)(                              (1)  )(LevelP -  Captured Candidates by TEIE  LevelOriginal - Actual candidates selected in Level For the software testing job opening, we received 127 applicants resume. Out of 127, our Talent Evaluation inference engine narrated to 47 candidates for the interview. According to equation 1, graph (Fig.3) is projected to show selection accuracy % in each interview level.HR Personnel?s are satisfied with 80% above accuracy. In addition, we have analyzed how the job performance, retention failure and explicit resignation parameters are improved for the employees who were recruited through our TEIE system on Jan 1st, 2009 as shown in Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure.6.
