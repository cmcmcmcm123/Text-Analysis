1 INTRODUCTION  Protein structure prediction is one of the most important

Abstract: As one of  KDTICM[8] theory researches, this paper propose an improved algorithm -- CBA , which is based on KDD* model and combined with KAAPRO method, for protein secondary structure prediction problem. Further, multi-layer systematic prediction model--Compound Pyramid Model, is proposed. The kernel of this model is CBA which is a classic association rules analysis algorithm. Domain knowledge is used through the model, and the phy-chemical attributes is chosen by Causal Cellular Automation. In experiment, the proteins bias alpha/beta structure are precisely predicted. The structures of amino acids, whose structure are obscure, are predicted well by the improved CBA .Finally, the result of this model is satisfied.

Key Words: Association Rule, Protein secondary structure Prediction, Compound Pyramid Model, CBA algorithm        Figure 1 The compound pyramid model  (Note: Comprehensive analysis layer integrates SVM multi-classification and homogenous analysis methods, as a result  there are 4 sets, in Figure 1 the numbers in circles denotes: identified as H or E, outputted as a part of result; basically  identified as H or E, the further judgment is necessary; difficult to be identified, the assistant judgment is necessary; identified  as C, outputted as a part of result.)   3 KDD* MODEL In the KDD* process model [7], the heuristic coordinator and the maintaining coordinator are the most essential mechanisms. The heuristic coordinator simulates the ?intention creation? in cognitive psychology, so that the shortage of knowledge could be found. In the classical KDD process, the focus depends on user?s interest, consequently much useful knowledge would be neglected.

So the heuristic coordinator could help the system of KDD obtain hidden useful knowledge, and work more actively, that the human experts? confinement would be counterbalanced.

The maintaining coordinator simulates the ?psychological information renovation?, a feature in cognitive psychology, so that the real-time maintenance of knowledgebase is realized. Because of the maintaining coordinator?s introduction, under the correct definitions of repetition, contradiction and redundancy, the repeated, contradicted and redundant knowledge could be processed in real time by super graph theory. As a result, only the hypothesis of knowledge which is possible to be new know ledges, needs to be processed, and furthest diminish the workload. In the practical expert system, the new knowledge is usually much less than the hypothesis of knowledge, hence maintaining coordinator would improve the efficiency of the system.

(Directional searching)  (Directional mining)   Figure 2 KDD* process model    4 IMPROVED CBA ALGORTITHM Improved CBA algorithm is in core judgment layer of the compound pyramid model, whose core is the KDD * model based on KDTICM theory and improved CBA association classifier protein secondary structure prediction algorithm which is based on complexity distance measure of support and confidence. This layer aimed at taking advantage of the association rules which is mining by high purity of ?  and ?  protein database using the KAAPRO methods in KDD * model. The construction of the two databases is up to CATH method [18], which the condition is less than 30 percent homology of ?  and ?  protein. Because of high purity database, the results are precisely refinement association rules. According to the mining results of the refinement association rules with a high starting point, based on improved CBA association classifier protein secondary structure prediction algorithm, classifies the protein which cannot judge by the layer of comprehensive analysis and the layer of assist judge.

In partial alpha, beta-protein secondary structure prediction problem, the determination role of the main core layer is classify the different of SVM and homology analysis voting. Using the alpha, beta association rules generated by KDD * system, reduce to the purify knowledge database of alpha, beta rules. After repeated experiments of the training set, we got the parameter of alpha, beta knowledge database for the proportion of support and confidence. Experiment verify that the results are reliable, and prove that we get the parameter of alpha, beta knowledge database for the proportion of  support and confidence can save as a fixed knowledge and embed in the whole of compound pyramid model.

In the using CBA process, we break the convention which is simply setting of support thresholds, according to the cumulative confidence as classify criteria of alpha, beta.

We do not just use the single measure of confidence, but using confidence and support of the complexity distance measure as a composite measure, which way can better embody the two major indicators in the secondary protein structure prediction.

In the association rules mining process, we also break the convention. According to the characteristics of protein  2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC 2009) 5177      biological data, we give up the common protein database to generate association rules; on contrary ,we use the relative bias alpha, beta protein database. This way resolves the difficult problem that the support and confidence of association rules in protein association rules mining is low and the rules cannot be trust. The experiments proved that compare with the classic protein prediction precision we get a greater precision.

4.1 CBA Algorithm Based on Complex Distance Measure CBA algorithm in the classic classification issues, set a fixed threshold of support measure, which is a single confidence metric. It?s equal to reduce to a single dimension of confidence and given up the metric of support measure. We believe that in two-dimensional protein structure prediction problem the support measure dimension is also important. In the classic association classifier the way of abandon the support measure is unfit in the secondary structure prediction problem. The support is also important parameter, which is including hidden knowledge of classification Rules, so we design based on the complex distance measurement of improved CBA algorithm.

Through the mining of KDD* system, the alpha, beta rules base is showed as follows:   Table 1 A part of alpha database mining results  (Note: Condition is composed of several items, that are separated by space, which denotes ?and?; Support and Confidence are denoted by real number) Classic CBA algorithm evaluation function is as follows:  /   n  CBA i i  Score confidence? ? =  = ? , evaluation function only sum the satisfied iconfidence  of irule , according to  CBA CBAScore Score ? ?? , predict the protein is alpha type  ,if CBA CBAScore Score ? ?? ,then predict the protein is beta  type ,and if the difference is neglect, then send the part of protein to the optimize layer. This is equal to reduce the support dimension, just consider as the confidence measure. In our experiment, we found out the protein data in biology is typical high dimensional nonlinear data. Only using the setting of support threshold is hard to complete the problem of protein secondary prediction.

From our experimental system, we got the statistics of the Mining KDD rules for the alpha and beta the rules, because of the use of the relatively high starting point alpha, beta protein database, so we got the association rules whose confidences are relatively high, the majority are upper than 95 percent, it lost the significance of statistical. So we have statistics to distribution of rule?s support measure.

Figure 3 distribution of support measure statistics in alpha rules base  In Figure 3, the abscissa is the support of alpha rules base, longitudinal coordinates show the number of corresponding support.

Figure 4 distributions of support measure statistics in beta rules base  In Figure 4, the abscissa is the support of beta rules base, longitudinal coordinates show the number of corresponding support.

In such statistics, it only focus on the number of same support in statistical analyze. Obviously in this case the high support of association rules is relatively neglect.

Although the high degree of support is a small port of the total rules, this high-degree support of rules is more meaningful in the protein prediction. So we re-statist the chart, which has the same abscissa of support, and longitudinal coordinates is multiple the number of support with the corresponding value of support. In this case the problem domain becomes a complex measure. We believe that the statistics of distribution under such condition is closer to the real situation.

Figure 5 distributions of support measure statistics in alpha rules base (variety parameter method)  5178 2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC 2009)      Figure 6 distributions of support measure statistics in beta rules base (variety parameter method)  Through Figure 3 - Figure 6, we get the distribution of association would not be any obvious mathematical distribution, so based on the classic CBA algorithm consider a single confidence measure and solely rely on setting of support threshold is not appropriate.

So, we proposed an improved CBA complex measure algorithm in this paper based on the classic CBA algorithm, which the new evaluation function is as follows:  1/ 2 2 2 sup   (( ) ( sup ) ) n  D CBA conf i i i  Score w confidence w port? ?? =  = +?  confw  and supw  are parameters of support and confidence, In order to facilitate the training, without loss of generality evaluation function will be rewritten as:  1sup/ 2 2 2   12 2 2 sup   (( ) ( sup ) )  (( ) ( sup ) )  n  D CBA i i i conf  n  i i confi  w Score confidence port  w  confidence w port  ? ? ?  =  =  = +  = +  ?  ?   When sup 0 conf  w ? , /D CBAScore ? ?  ?  will become to  / CBAScore ? ? on contrary, when  sup conf  w ? ? , /D CBAScore ? ?  ?  will become to  /  sup  n  D CBA i i  Score port? ?? =  =? , in this moment D-CBA is equal to classic CBA algorithm. Under the training of train set, we can pick up a best *sup  conf w  for classifier to  effectively prediction alpha-protein and beta-protein.

4.2 Experiment The test set of our experiment is identical of paper [13] which is the partial ? / ? protein database contain by the 256 B, 351C, 9PAP, 1BP2 four protein sequence. Q3 is used as a evaluation criterion, which is defined to proportion of the correct number of amino acids and the total number of amino acids.

Based on the complex distance measure of improved CBA algorithm, mainly in the core layer process different part of SVM multi-classification and homology analysis in layer of comprehensive analysis. As shown in Table 2, based on the support and confidence complex measure CBA algorithm compared with classic CBA algorithm in  the same dataset to run on the rate of discrimination.( Among parameters sup  conf w  in D-CBA is under a trained  set of the optimal parameters *sup conf  w ,on contrary the  result of classic CBA is the best result of different support threshold settings .)  Table 2 D-CBA compared with classic CBA  Model through the layer of comprehensive analysis deal with the test set, get 50.4 percent of the amino acid secondary structure was basically decided, with some obvious features of the structure, this part was 92.2 percent accuracy; further in assisted prejudgment layer and core prejudgment layer focus on the more complex amino acids to predict, the collection is divided into two parts, one is the homology sequence methods and SVM both predict to un-Coil amino acid type (59 windows, here referred to the collection of NC), the other part is the homology sequence methods and SVM predict dissimilarly to Coil amino acid type method (200 window, here referred to the collection of C). Collection for the NC, which generally mixed with little part of Coil structure, therefore we can be used directly based on the support and confidence complexity distance measure of improved CBA to ? / ? second structure prediction, the forecast accuracy is 74.6 percent. Collection of C, through SVM classification will be divided into two collections, one  part is Coil structure of the amino acid after SVM Classifier, and the other is by the rest parts .

Then through the SVM classifier and the KAAPRO methods, respectively 89.2 percent and 59.6 percent accuracy. Integrated part of the results in the pyramid model , the overall accuracy of the test set get 86%. The result has been more than [13] which was published by the results of 81 percent, the results of the test is now known as the highest prediction accuracy.

Table 3 result details in Q3  5 CONCLUSION Protein secondary structure prediction is a difficult problem in the biological information domain. Based on KDTICM theory framework, we proposed an improved CBA association classifier protein secondary structure prediction algorithm which is based on complexity distance measure of support and confidence .And be its core, we built a refinement  multi-hierarchical compound pyramid model.

Experiments show that this model and classified algorithm  D-CBA CBA Alpha protein  accuracy 79.2% 51.% Beta protein  accuracy 70.7% 40.5% Total 74.6% 47.4%  2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC 2009) 5179      can complete the prediction of unobvious structure of amino acid, get the understanding association rules. In some points, the model and algorithm revealed the impact relations of the physical and chemical properties of amino acids for protein secondary structure in space conformation.
