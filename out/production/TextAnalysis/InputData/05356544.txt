Secure Two and Multi-party Association Rule Mining

Abstract?Association rule mining provides useful knowledge from raw data in different applications such as health, in- surance, marketing and business systems. However, many real world applications are distributed among two or more parties, each of which wants to keep its sensitive information private, while they collaboratively gaining some knowledge from their data. Therefore, secure and distributed solutions are needed that do not have a central or third party accessing the parties? original data. In this paper, we present a new protocol for privacy-preserving association rule mining to overcome the security flaws in existing solutions, with better performance, when data is vertically partitioned among two or more parties.

Two sub-protocols for secure binary dot product and cardinality of set intersection for binary vectors are also designed which are used in the main protocols as building blocks.

I. INTRODUCTION  Privacy-preserving data mining is an emerging challenge in computer science because of the importance of security and privacy of individuals when data is distributed among two or more parties, each of which is not willing, and is often prohibited, to reveal its private and sensitive information to the others. Therefore, standard algorithms for data mining have to be replaced with secure protocols. Many secure protocols have been proposed so far for data mining and machine learning techniques such as [8], [3], [19], [16], [10] for decision tree classification, [21], [23] in Na??ve Bayesian Classification, [7], [15], [6], [12] for clustering, [4], [13], [11] for Neural Networks, and [20] for Bayesian Networks.

One of the other popular and useful techniques in data mining is the association rule mining, in which associations and/or correlations among items in a large dataset are discov- ered. This technique has a wide variety of applications such as in health and medical research, business and marketing, homeland security, etc. There are some privacy-preserving protocols for this technique proposed by [14], [17], [22]. In this paper, we introduce new protocols for privacy-preserving association rule mining when data is heterogeneously dis- tributed among two or more parties. We also provide a review of existing work, highlighting some of their potential security problems, and a comparison to our proposed protocols. In Section II, the association rule is briefly reviewed. In Section III, we first explain why we need two building blocks, Secure Binary Dot Product and Cardinality of Set Intersection, and then we present our sub-protocols and main protocols for a privacy-preserving association rule.

and security analysis are also discussed in this section.

In Section IV, experimental results and comparisons with previous work are shown. Section V is dedicated to related work and some of its potential security problems. Finally, conclusions and future work are described in Section VI.



II. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING Association rule mining has been widely used since its  introduction by Agrawal and Imielinski [1] to help discover patterns and associations in datasets. A short definition of this technique follows.

Suppose X and Y are two sets of items. Given a database S of tuples, a tuple t will satisfy rule X ? Y if t contains X and also contains Y . The percentage of tuples satisfying X and Y to the set of all possible tuples is called the Support of X ? Y , and the ratio of the support of X ? Y to the support of X is called the confidence of X ? Y . Thus, formally we have:  SupportX?Y =  ?  S  CountX,Y  |S| ConfidenceX?Y =  SupportX?Y SupportX  Normally there are two support and confidence thresholds in every application, to which support and confidence of rules are compared. The association rule is usually applied on binary data, and non-binary data can be easily converted to binary data using discretization. The major steps of the standard algorithm for the association rule is shown in algorithm 1 [1]. Function apriori-gen generates the set of  Algorithm 1 Association Rule Mining Procedure 1: L1 = {large 1-itemsets} 2: for (k=2; Lk?1 ?= ?; k++) do 3: Ck = apriori-gen(Lk?1) 4: for all candidates c ?

III. NEW PROTOCOLS FOR PRIVACY-PRESERVING ASSOCIATION RULE MINING  In this section, we introduce two new, and secure, protocols for Secure Binary Dot Product (SBDP) and Cardinality of  Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Security and Defense Applications (CISDA 2009)  ?2009 Crown Copyright    TABLE I RAW BINARY DATA OF THREE VECTORS V1 , V2 AND V3 .

V1 V2 V3  1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1  Set Intersection (CSI) when we are dealing with two and more than two parties, respectively. However, we first explain why we need these sub-protocols for vertically partitioned data. As we saw in the procedure for computing the support and confidence of each rule, because each attribute belongs to one party, values of each attribute can be considered as a vector. Now, suppose P1 and P2 have binary vectors V1 and V2 respectively. If they want to compute the number of rows that have value ?1? in both vectors, they have to run a SBDP together. In the same way, with three or more parties, CSI must be jointly computed. To illustrate the concept, let?s consider the values in Table I as an example. In this table we  can see that | 3? Vi  i=1  | = 2. Here, set intersection means the set of row numbers that have value ?1? in all vectors. In these protocols, we assume that parties are semi-honest, i.e. they follow the protocols but may keep intermediate information to infer others? data.

A. Secure Binary Dot Product (SBDP)  Suppose P1 and P2 each of which has a binary vector, V1 and V2, respectively, want to jointly and securely compute the dot product of their vectors. They will perform the following steps:  1) P1 converts its vector, V1, to the summation of two non-binary vectors, U11 and U12.

2) P2 does the same and constructs two non-binary vec- tors, U21 and U22 from V2.

V1 = U11 + U12 V2 = U21 + U22  3) Now, the scalar product of the binary vectors V1 and V2 is transformed to four scalar product of non-binary vectors.

V1 ? V2 = (U11 ? U21) + (U11 ? U22) + (U12 ? U21) + (U12 ? U22)  Each dot product can be securely computed using a Secure Dot Product (SDP) protocol. One of the best techniques, for security and efficiency, is presented by Goethals et al. [5]. Suppose X = (x1, x2, ? ? ? , xN ) and Y = (y1, y2, ? ? ? , yN ). P1 creates a pair of public and private keys using a homomorphic encryption, such as Pallier [9], and sends the public key to P2. P1 sends Ci = e(xi)(1 ? i ? N) to P2. P2 computes W = N?  i=1  Cyii , generates its private share S2 and sends W ? =  W ?e(?S2) to P1. P1 computes its private share S1 = d(W ?) = (X ? Y ) ? S2. This procedure is applied for all SDPs between P1 and P2.

4) Now each party has four private shares such that the summation of these numbers is the dot product of V1 and V2.

Note that if we apply the SDP protocol directly on binary vectors, such as in [18], privacy of the parties is no longer preserved. P2 has the public key, and therefore by encrypting ?1? and comparing it with the received encrypted items from P1, P2 is able to reveal the private vector of P1.

B. Cardinality of Set Intersection (CSI) among three or more parties  When we are dealing with more than two parties, SBDP is not applicable and to find the support or confidence of a rule, we have to compute the CSI of the vectors involved.

However, we cannot simply apply secure protocols for this problem on binary vectors because of security flaws discussed before. We now present a new and secure protocol for computing the CSI for more than two parties with binary vectors. Suppose P1, ? ? ? , Pn, (n ? 3), each of which has a binary vector, want to jointly and securely compute CSI of their vectors. This means they have to count the number of the rows whose values in all vectors are ?1?. They will take the following steps:  1) P1, by using a random number generator, converts its vector, V1, to the summation of n vectors such that:  V1 = V1,1 + V1,2 + ? ? ?+ V1,n (1) 2) P1 generates public and private keys (e, d) for an  additive homomorphic encryption and publishes the public key, e, to the other parties.

3) P1 encrypts V1,2, V1,3, ? ? ? , V1,n using the public key and sends e(V1,i) to Pi, 2 ? i ? n.

4) P2 computes e(V2) and sends V ?2 = e(V2) ? e(V1,2) to P3.

5) Pi, 3 ? i ? n ? 1, computes e(Vi) and sends V ?i = e(Vi) ? e(V1,i) ? V ?i?1 to Pi+1.

6) Pn generates a random vector Un, encrypts this vector, e(Un), computes V ?n = e(Vn) ? e(V1,n) ? V ?n?1 ? e(Un) and sends it to P1.

7) P1 decrypts V ?n, and sets U1 = V1,1 + d(V ? n).

8) P1 and Pn jointly generate a random permutation, ?, and create U ?1 = ?(U1) and U  ? n = ?(Un) respectively.

Then they divide these vectors to n ? 2 parts and send parts U ?1,k and U  ? n,k, 2 ? k ? n ? 1 to the  corresponding party (P2, ? ? ? , Pn?1).

9) Each party Pk, 2 ? k ? n? 1, computes U ?1,k ?U ?n,k,  and counts the rows with the value n. The summation of these counters is the final result for the CSI of the n parties.

Note that this protocol can be also applied to two parties if we have a trusted third party to receive the final permuted vectors and compute the counts. To make the protocol more clear, we give a small example. Suppose the number of parties is    n = 4, each vector?s dimension is N = 6, and following are the vectors owned by the parties:  P1 : V1 = (1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1) P2 : V2 = (1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1) P3 : V3 = (1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1) P4 : V4 = (1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1).

Let?s assume that:  V1 = V1,1 + V1,2 + V1,3 + V1,4  where:  P1 : V1,1 = (5,?9, 0, 12,?1, 6) V1,2 = (?3, 4, 5,?18, 0, 1) V1,3 = (1,?6,?3, 5,?7,?9) V1,4 = (?2, 11,?1, 2, 8, 3).

Now, P1 sends following encrypted vectors to the other parties:  P1 : e(V1,2) ?? P2 e(V1,3) ?? P3 e(V1,4) ?? P4.

P2 computes V ?2 as follows and sends to P3:  P2 : V ?2 = e(V2) ? e(V1,2) = e(1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1)  ? e(?3, 4, 5,?18, 0, 1) = e(?2, 5, 5,?17, 1, 2) ?? P3.

P3 computes V ?3 as follows and sends to P4:  P3 : V ?3 = e(V3) ? e(V1,3) ? V ?2 = e(1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1)  ? e(1,?6,?3, 5,?7,?9) ? e(?2, 5, 5,?17, 1, 2)  = e(0,?1, 3,?11,?5,?6) ?? P4.

P4 generates U4, computes V ?4 and sends it to P1:  P4 : U4 = (10,?3, 0, 6, 1,?5) V ?4 = e(V4) ? e(V1,4) ? V ?3 ? e(U4)  = e(1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1) ? e(?2, 11,?1, 2, 8, 3) ? e(0,?1, 3,?11,?5,?6) ? e(10,?3, 0, 6, 1,?5)  = e(9, 7, 3,?3, 4,?7) ?? P1.

P1 decrypts V ?4 , and computes U1 and U ? 1:  P1 : U1 = d(V ?4) + V1,1 = (9, 7, 3,?3, 4,?7)  + (5,?9, 0, 12,?1, 6) = (14,?2, 3, 9, 3,?1)  U ?1 = ?(U1) = ?(14,?2, 3, 9, 3,?1) = (3, 3,?1, 14, 9,?2).

P4 calculates U ?4:  P4 : U ?4 = ?(U4) = ?(10,?3, 0, 6, 1,?5) = (1, 0,?5, 10, 6,?3).

P1 and P4 divide each of U ?1 and U ? 4, respectively, to two  parts and send to P2 and (P3 as follows:  P1 : U ?1,2 = (3, 3,?1) ?? P2 U ?1,3 = (14, 9,?2) ?? P3.

P4 : U ?4,2 = (1, 0,?5) ?? P2 U ?4,3 = (10, 6,?3) ?? P3.

P2 and P3 compute C2 and C3, respectively:  P2 : U ?1,2 ? U ?4,2 = (2, 3, 4) =? C2 = 1 P3 : U ?1,3 ? U ?4,3 = (4, 3, 1) =? C3 = 1.

Therefore, the CSI of these vectors is C = C2 + C3 = 2.

These two sub-protocols, SBDP and CSI, help us to  securely run the procedure for association rule mining.

Whenever we want to count the number of records that satisfy a rule, first each party specifies its attributes involved in that rule. Then, if those attributes belong to two parties, SBDP is used to compute the number of records satisfying the rule.

Otherwise CSI will be used for this computation. To compute the support of a rule, that number is divided by the number of all records, which is public. Computing the confidence of a rule, say X ? Y , is also straightforward because it is the division of the support of that rule by the support of the left side of the rule, i.e. X .

Correctness of the Algorithm We denote the cardinality of the set intersection for n vectors, Vi, . . . , Vn, as |  n? Vi  i=1  |.

If we apply a permutation on all the vectors, the result does not change and it is just applied in our protocol to preserve the privacy of the parties? inputs. Therefore, to show the correctness of the algorithm we ignore the permutation.

According to the algorithm:  U1 = V1,1 + d(V ?n) = V1,1 + d(e(Vn) ? e(V1,n) ? V ?n?1 ? e(Un)) = V1,1 + d(e(Vn) ? e(V1,n) ? e(Vn?1) ?  e(V1,n?1) ? V ?n?2 ? e(Un)) ...

= V1,1 + d(e(Vn) ? e(Vn?1) ? . . . ? e(V2) ?  e(V1,n) ? e(V1,n?1) ? . . . ? e(V1,2) ? e(Un)) = V1,1 + d(e((Vn + Vn?1 + . . . + V2) +  (V1,n + V1,n?1 + . . . + V1,2) + Un)) = V1,1 + (Vn + Vn?1 + . . . + V2) +  (V1,n + V1,n?1 + . . . + V1,2) + Un = (V1,1 + V1,2 + . . . + V1,n) +  (V2 + . . . + Vn) + Un = V1 + V2 + . . . + Vn + Un ? V1 + V2 + . . . + Vn = U1 ? Un  Each party k, 2 ? k ? n ? 1, computes some elements of U1 ? Un. Thus, each row in which the result is n means that the values in that row for all vectors are 1. Therefore, the number of ns in U1 ? Un is the final result for the CSI, which shows correctness of the algorithm.

Security Analysis  ? None of the Pis, (2 ? i ? n), knows the private key of the encryption system, and therefore cannot decrypt e(V1,i) received from P1. Furthermore, V1,is are randomly generated by P1 and even by colluding, P2, P3, ? ? ? , Pn are not able to reveal those vectors, except by guessing.

? Pi, (3 ? i ? n), receives n?1?  i=2  e(Vi) ? e(V1,i) from Pi?1.

However, by the above reason, is not able to decrypt the received value to figure out other parties? private information.

? Un is randomly generated by Pn, and also V ?n?1 is the production of all private vectors belong to the other par- ties. Thus, even after decrypting e(Un)?Vn?V1,n?V ?n?1, P1 cannot know Un and Vi, (2 ? i ? n).

? Random permutation is known only to P1 and Pn, and each party P2, ? ? ? , Pn?1 only receives a partial permuted vector. Therefore, private information of P1 and Pn is not revealed to the other parties.

Complexity Analysis Table II shows the complexity of the algorithm. The communication cost of the whole protocol is (n ? 3)N compared with 2nN in [22], in which N is the number of items in each vector (or the number of database records), and n is the number of the parties involved.

Also, for computational costs, we have one cryptographic key pair generation, (2n ? 2)N encryption and one decryption compared with two key pair generations at,nN + (n ? 1) encryption and one decryption in [22].

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  To show the applicability of the proposed protocol, we have implemented them with different number of parties and encryption key lengths, and have compared the results with previous work in the literature. The Java programming language and the Remote Method Invocation package (RMI) have been used in this implementation. Hardware specifica- tions for this experiment are as follows: ? Operating System: Windows XP ? CPU: 1.83 GHZ ? RAM: 1 GB  The implementation has been tested with key lengths of 512, 1024, and 2048 bits, for two, three, five, and ten parties.

Table III shows the cost of encryption for different numbers of items to be encrypted, and Tables IV, and V show the performance estimations of the protocol for different key bit lengths and comparison with the previous work, which has been tested only with key bit length of 512, assuming 100k of transactions with different numbers of attributes.

The worst case, in which all the attributes are frequent 1- itemsets, is assumed in this experiment. The execution time for our protocol represents total time taken by all the parties involved.

V. RELATED WORK  Privacy-preserving data mining has two main approaches, randomization and Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC).

These approaches can be applied to data mining techniques such as classification, clustering, support vector machines    TABLE IV EXTRA TOTAL COST (IN HOURS) TO ACHIEVE PRIVACY IN WORST-CASE SCENARIO WITH KEY BIT LENGTH OF 512 AND 100K TRANSACTIONS.

In this paper we focus on privacy- preserving association rule mining using the second ap- proach, i.e. Secure Multi-party Computation, when data is vertically partitioned among two or more parties.

Vaidya and Clifton [14] proposed a protocol for privacy- preserving association rule mining when data is vertically partitioned between two parties. By considering boolean data, they use a secure dot product (SDP) to compute the support and confidence of each rule. They use an algebraic solution for SDP by placing values in equations which are masked with random values. However, as indicated in their paper, it has security problems with boolean values.

Vaidya and Clifton [17] also present a protocol for the CSI in the two and multi-party cases which can be used in vertically partitioned data. They use commutative one- way hash functions, through which parties transform their private sets and compute the intersection of these sets. In this protocol, each party first converts its binary vector to a non- binary one by keeping the order of ones in the original vector.

For instance, if a party has a vector V = (1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1), it will be transformed to V ? = (1, 4, 5, 7). Although the protocol is not dealing with binary vectors any more, at the end of the protocol each party knows the number of 1?s in the private vectors belonging to the other parties.

Zhan et al. [22] introduced two algorithms in the two and multi-party cases for privacy-preserving association rule mining when data is vertically partitioned among the parties.

They used additive homomorphic encryption as the main building block. In the two-party case, one party, say P1, after generating encryption and decryption keys, selects a random vector R and a random number X and sends e(A1i +Ri ?X) to P2, in which A1i and Ri are the i-th item of P1?s vectors, A1, and R, respectively. P2 then computes n?  i=1  e(A1i+Ri?X)?A2i and sends it to P1. P1, by decrypting this number and computing mod X of the decrypted value, obtains the result of the dot product. The main problem in this protocol is that the first party, by knowing R and X , after decrypting the number received from P2 and before computing mod X of the result can figure out P2?s private  vector with high probability. We give a simple example to show the security problem of the protocol.

Suppose A1 = (1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1) and A2 = (1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1) respectively belong to P1 and P2, and also that P1 selects R = (5,?3, 2, 1, 4, 6) and X = 11. Therefore, P1 sends (e(56), e(?33), e(22), e(12), e(45), e(67)) to P2. P2 com- putes e(56) ? e(22) ? e(67) (because the other components of A2 are zero) and sends it back to P1. Now, P1 first decrypts this number and obtains 145 and then computes (145 mod 11) which is 2. Next, P1, by using these two numbers, is able to arrange different possible combinations for A2 and to decrease them to the ones that satisfy the result.

In this example, (1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1) is the only vector satisfying the final result. Thus the number of possible vectors for A2 decreases to 1, and P1 can exactly obtain P2?s private vector.

The main reason for information leakage and security problems in [22] is that it works directly with binary values which restricts the possible values of the second party?s vector. Also, the information received by the parties is not balanced, i.e. the first party receives more information than the second party which helps the former to reduce the privacy of the latter. Our protocol is completely balanced both parties having the same amount of intermediate information through the protocol. We also work with non-binary vectors after the first step, and therefore the possible values are not restricted to 0 and 1.

For the multi-party case in [22], the public key and the private key, e and d, as well as the integer number X are known to all parties except one (Pn). Therefore, the possibility of Pn knowing these values is very high. Although it is assumed that parties involved in the protocol are semi- honest, by conspiring between Pn and only one party among P1 to Pn?1 , e, d, and X are transferred to Pn and the other parties? private vectors will be revealed to Pn. However, in our protocol for the multi-party case, only two parties P1, and Pn need to be trusted to not transfer private key, d (note that d is only known to P1) and permutation ?, to the other parties. None of the other parties is able to help a party breach the protocol?s security.



VI. FUTURE WORK AND CONCLUSIONS  In this paper, two secure and efficient protocols have been presented for privacy-preserving association rule mining in the two and multi-party cases when data is vertically partitioned among the parties. These protocols use two new sub-protocols, that use additive homomorphic encryption, for secure binary dot product and cardinality of set intersec- tion. We have also reviewed the existing protocols in this area and have pointed out some of their potential security problems. The comparison of these work to ours shows that our proposed protocols can avoid these possible security shortcoming, while achieving a better communication and computational performance. One possible future direction is to apply our new sub-protocols as building blocks in other privacy-preserving data mining techniques such as sequential pattern mining, support vector machines, classification, and clustering, especially when using binary data where preserv-    ing privacy is more difficult because the attribute values are restricted to 0 and 1.
