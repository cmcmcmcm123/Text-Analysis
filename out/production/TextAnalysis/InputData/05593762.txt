I. INTRODUCTION With the development of society and the need of  modernization, the City Operational System has accumulated lots of useful data, and it has become a focal point in this field that how to find knowledge and make a strategic decision.

Compared with available mass monitoring data, the potential symptoms of accidents are ?small samples? information models.

How to find these symptoms in the mass monitoring data of the City Operational System is crucial and important to prevent the accidents happening.

Data Mining is a progress in which the potential knowledge is found. Compared with numerous data, outlier data are those that are small but obviously deviated from the other data, not meet the general pattern or behavior of the data, and may be noise or the reflection of nature of the data. But outlier data may contain more valuable information than normal data, so they should be studied as important data also. Outlier data mining is an important study field of data mining, which is dedicated to find the objects that are significantly different from the other data in the data set [1]. So far, the outlier data mining has been widely studied and applied in many fields, such as weather forecasts and the time series data analysis [2].

This paper, combining the method of outlier data mining with associational rules, is about the mining and discovery of potential symptoms in unforeseen accidents of the City Operation System.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the concept of association rules will be introduced and the outliers in city operation system database are analyzed. In section 3, an outlier mining algorithm based on association rules are described and relevant experiments are given to prove its validity. Finally the conclusions are given in section 4.



II. BRIEF REVIEW OF ASSOCIATION RULES Mining association rules is an important branch of data  mining, which describes potential relations among data items in databases, such as attribute and variant. Since R. Agrawal put forward Apriori algorithm, Association rule mining becomes one of the most popular research in data mining [3]. Mining association rules can be stated as follows:  Suppose 1 2{ , , , }mI i i i? ? be a set of items, let D, the task-relevant data, be a set of transactions, where each transaction T is a set of items such that T I? . The quantities of items bought are not considered. Each transaction is assigned an identifier, called TID. Let A be a set of items, a transaction T is said to contain A if and only if A T? . An association rule is an implication of the form A B? , where A I? , B I? , and A B? ?? . The rule A B?  holds  in the transaction set D with support s, where s is the percentage of transactions in D that contain A B? . This is taken to be the probability, ( )P A B? . The rule A B?  has confidence c in the transaction set D if c is the percentage of transactions in D containing A that also contain B. This is taken to be the conditional probability, ( | )P B A . That is,  ( ) ( )Support A B P A B s? ? ? ?  ( ) ( | ) ( ) / ( )  Confidence A B P B A Support A B Support A c  ? ? ? ? ?  Mining association rules is to mine strong association rules that satisfy the user-specified both minimum support threshold and confidence one. More details could be found in [4].

Computer Science & Education Hefei, China. August 24?27, 2010   ThP9.25      The function of mining association rules is analyzing the relation between data items, and the rules of infrequent itemsets and more interesting ones. In order to finish the goal of outlier data mining, the itemsets less than the given threshold should be searched upon this.



III. OUTLIER MINING AND CITY OPERATION SYSTEM  A. Outlier Mining Outliers are the data that obviously deviate from others,  disobey the general mode or behavior of data and disaccord with other existing data. The concrete definition is as follows: Supposing 1 2{ , , , }nX x x x? ? , 1 2{ , , , }nY y y y? ?  are n-demensional vectors, where X D	 , Y D	 , and D is a sample set. Y is called an outlier when it satisfiers the following condition: * *[ ]E Y E X ? ? , where is outlier factor, and *E  is the eigen operator of the entire sample set [5].

Outliers may originate from measuring errors, computer inputting errors or man-caused errors, etc. These are usually called noise data. Outliers may also reflect the true properties of data, such as the rare disastrous weather recorded in meteorological database, which often contains one or more properties whose values seriously deviate from the normal values. However, these data may contain more valuable information than normal data. The so-called outlier mining means extracting outliers from the database. The discovery of outliers may result in some true but unexpected knowledge, therefore such data should be retained.

Outlier data may be noise or interesting data of association rules. Therefore, the important monitoring data should be confirmed through interaction of experts and machine, then a synthetically analysis is given combining with other forecast methods to acknowledge whether the monitoring data is the potential symptoms of the City Operational System.

B. The Outliers in Data of City Operation System There are mass monitoring data in the City Operation  System, which are collected from different departments and fields of the city, such as traffic, weather, all kinds of water, electricity, windpipe line, and etc. The relations between these data are complicated, the change of some data may have direct or indirect influence on the other data. Among the mass and complicated data, the data which have great influence on the normal running of he City Operation System should be given due attention. However, the change of some data are not obvious, but the data still have some impact to the city system's normal running, that are the outlier data of the City Operation System. The traditional data forecast methods can describe and analyze the change trend of all kinds of data easily, but it can't give a quantitative express of the degree of the relation between the data. Therefore, the outlier mining of the City Operation System is obviously important.



IV. DESCRIPTION AND APPLICATION OF ALGORITHM  A. Description of Algorithm As mentioned above, the results of the association rules  mining, the relationships between different data can be obtained by solving the problem of the frequency itemsets and  then giving appropriate thresholds of the support and confidence. The purpose of outlier mining is to search the data itemsets which meet some threshold condition. If the definitions of association rules miming were improved and some outlier conditional items were defined, the outlier data, namely which are different obviously from other data, could be mining and analyzed.

The outlier mining algorithm based on association rules is described in Fig. 1 as following:  Input :   dataset , max support threshold max_ ;  Output: Outlier datasets ;  Begin:  = ;  //  is the condition itemsets of kth layer of rules tree  = ;  compute ;1  for( =1, ,  D s  Oset  Ck  Ck  Oset  C  k C k nk      ? )  Begin  scan  and count support each ;  if support( )< max_  and support( ) 0 then  = +{ }  if satisfies pruning criteria then discard ;    D ci  c s c  O O cset set  c  ?  else = +Children( );  End  output ;  End  C C ck k  Oset  Figure 1. description of algorithm  The complexity of the algorithm is analyzed and the validity is proved in two ways in [6]. The algorithm is applied in the City Operation System, after some pretreatments on the monitoring data, and the application case is given in following section.

B. Application and Analysis The monitoring data of the City Operation System include  traffic, weather, energy, water, and etc. Water data used to analyze in this paper are listed in Table :  TABLE I. DATA FORMAT OF WATER  Water Monitoring Data Water  Water Supply Water Drainage  20080607 217 270  20080608 222 265  20080609 221 255  ? ? ?   ThP9.25      Electricity and coal data used to analyze in this paper are listed in Table  and Table :  TABLE II. DATA FORMAT OF ELECTRICITY  Electricity Monitoring Data Electricity  Actual Load Predicted Load  20090802 1066.2 1253  20090803 1051.5 1129  20090804 1095.8 1150  ? ? ?  TABLE III. DATA FORMAT OF COAL  Coal Monitoring Data Coal  Buy Sell Stock  20090802 2.14 2.71 36.62  20090803 2.37 2.69 37.11  20090804 2.65 2.83 36.86  ? ? ? ?  The process of the algorithm running is as follows: first, some parameters are set in the user interface program, then, the algorithm are called. The data should be selected beforehand and be jointed according the date. At last, the results are given in form of rules, and more clearer and understandable interpretations are given with visual graphic display.

If a rule about the relationship between the item ?coal_Sell? and ?coal_Stock? is mined, it can be described in form of ?coal_Sell->coal_Stock(with support 0.2 and confidence 0.3)?.

Its visual meaning can be described in a reference frame which horizontal axis represents support and vertical one represents confidence, showed as Fig. 2:  Figure 2. description of the visual meaning of a rule  More clearer and understandable interpretations about the rules can be given according the experts of City System. The outlier itemset is all the items which satisfied the criterion of outlier condition threshold.

In practical running, this algorithm is carried out on mass history data. Its precisions are validated according to the analytical result of experts. Some precision comparison results are listed in Table :  TABLE IV. PRECISION COMPARISON RESULTS  Precision Comparison Number of Data Algorithm Expert  500 77.64% 75.22%  1000 78.31% 72.86%  1500 79.84% 68.37%  It can be seen from the Table  that the precisions of algorithm are higher than those of expert subjective prediction.

The comparison experiments also show that the precision of algorithm will be higher when the number of data is increasing, while the speed of mining will descend.



V. CONCLUSIONS The outlier mining on monitoring data of the City  Operation System is to find the potential symptoms data which may endanger the City System. The potential symptoms data always are difficult to find or forecast by traditional data process method, if they are identified as noise points and therefore their influence on the system might be ignored.

Therefore, the outlier data should be mined using data mining methods.

The outlier mining method based on association rules is applied to analyze the symptoms in the mass monitoring data of the City Operation System in this paper, and has been applied in the practical city management software system successfully.
