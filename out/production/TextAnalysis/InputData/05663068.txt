Intrusion detection based on fuzzy association rules

Abstract-With the rapid development of computer network technology, network not only provides the service for the people, but also has brought many negative effects.

Intrusion detection is used to solve this problem. In order to improve the speed and intensity of intrusion detection, data mining technology can be applied to intrusion detection systems. Association rules are a common method in data mining. But, it causes the sharp boundary problem. The concept of fuzzy set is better than partition method because fuzzy sets provide a smooth transition between members and non-members of a set, consequently handle the sharp boundary problem in an appropriate way. In this paper, fuzzy association rules is researched in Intrusion Detection System. And Intrusion Detection framework is designed. It outperforms other methods, especially in terms of false positive rate.

INTRODUCTION  As the network continues to expand the scope and technology advances, network attacks have increased, and the damage is getting bigger and bigger. The traditional limitations of intrusion detection methods include: lack of effectiveness, lack of fitness, lack of scalability. To overcome these limitations, the effective tools are urgently needed to help people find the relationship or pattern of data timely and accurately from the vast amounts of data, and find useful information in order to make the right decisions. Data Mining is such a tool and technology. An advantage of data mining techniques applied to intrusion detection system is that the normal or invasive behavior model can be extracted from a large number of the network data and the host log data automatically. One common disadvantage of most data mining techniques is the extensive amount of time required for training and learning the model being inspected. The purpose of this paper is to propose a relatively fast data mining based approach to intrusion detection, in which fuzzy association rules are utilized for learning monitored behaviors in a network.



II. INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM  A. The Definitions ofintnlsion detection  The study of Intrusion Detection can be traced back James P. Anderson's work in 1980. In April of that year, he did a technical report entitled "Computer Security Threat Monitoring  and Surveillance" for the U.S. Air Force. The report was recognized as the pioneer for Intrusion Detection. In the report, he first proposed the definition of intrusion detection, and defmed Intrusion Attempt or Threat as the attempts that premeditated potential unauthorized access to information, operate information, resulting system in unreliable or unable to use.

Intrusion detection is the process which identifies attempt invasion, ongoing invasion or the invasion occurred, and takes appropriate measures. Through the computer network or some key points of the computer system to collect information and to analyze, discover whether a network or system have violations of security policy and signs of attack. Intrusion detection software and hardware combination is the intrusion detection system.

Intrusion detection system to perform the main tasks include: monitoring, analysis of user and system activities, the audit system structure and weaknesses identified, reflecting the activities of known attack pattems, alarm to the stakeholders, statistical analysis of abnormal behavior, evaluate important system and data files integrity, tracking management operating system, identify the user behavior of security policy violations.

Intrusion Detection System includes four steps data preprocessing, data analysis, and incident response. The process is shown as Figure 1  '--Sn"""i""'ffe-r""  Figure 1. Model ofIntrusion Detection System  B. Common Intntsion Detection Technology  Intrusion detection techniques can be categorized into anomaly detection and misuse detection.

Misuse detection use known methods and attack mode to establish attack pattem library, and use the collection data of the network or host nodes to match the data of the attack pattern database. If we find the current behavior and a pattern matching, we can judge possible improper conduct or assault.

Intrusion detection software and hardware combination is the intrusion detection system.

Intrusion detection system to perform the main tasks include: monitoring, analysis of user and system activities, the audit system structure and weaknesses identified, reflecting the activities of known attack pattems, alarm to the stakeholders, statistical analysis of abnormal behavior, evaluate important system and data files integrity, tracking management operating system, identify the user behavior of security policy violations.

Intrusion Detection System includes four steps data preprocessing, data analysis, and incident response. The process is shown as Figure 1  '--Sn"""i""'ffe-r""  Figure 1. Model ofIntrusion Detection System  B. Common Intntsion Detection Technology  Intrusion detection techniques can be categorized into anomaly detection and misuse detection.

Misuse detection use known methods and attack mode to establish attack pattem library, and use the collection data of the network or host nodes to match the data of the attack pattern database. If we find the current behavior and a pattern matching, we can judge possible improper conduct or assault.

2010 International Symposium on Intelligence Information Processing and Trusted Computing  DOI 10.1109/IPTC.2010.28     Such detection methods for known intrusion patterns and system defects can accurately identify. Detection process is simple, fast, high accuracy and low false positive rate. It can be made to reflect different patterns depending on the attack.

However, due to a wide range of means and methods of attack, and in the growing technological complexity, and misuse detection rely mainly on existing attack pattern database, it can not cover all invasive methods and not detect unknown the system attacks. Thus it is easy to generate the false negative.

How to construct a sufficiently general and accurate intrusion methods that can be updated frequently to represent the known intrusion methods, how to improve the efficiency of misuse detection, it is the misuse detection of the main probl=s facing the current.

Anomaly detection is also known as behavior-based detection. It determines whether there is invasion based on user behavior and the use of system and network resources whether it has deviated from the normal. For example, it defmes the variables for the r subject resources and object (i.e., user, workstation, server, file and so on), and by observing the historical data establishes the base value for each variable.

When the system activities, using the degree of agreement of variable and the base value to determine abnormal. This method has the advantage of versatile, widely recognized type of attack. It can even detect the system unknown intrusion patterns. The disadvantage is that algorithm complexity and high rate of false negative and false positives. In addition, because the rule base must be constantly updated, if the attacker knows a system is under the surveillance of intrusion detection systems, their intrusion are recognized by the system if an attacker is on the intrusion detection system for long-term training,

III. DATA MrNING  A. The Definitions ofdata mining  Data Mining is that extract implicit. unknown in advance but potentially useful information and knowledge, from extensive, incomplete, noisy, ambiguous, random ,practical application data. Simply, data mining is to extract or excavate knowledge form extensive data.

Data mining is an application-oriented technology. It combines the multidisciplinary field of knowledge, including database technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks, statistics, pattern recognition, knowledge base systems, knowledge acquisition, information retrieval, high- performance computing, data visualization and so on.

E. Data mining process  For the data mining process, the experts basically reached a consensus, summarized as the following five steps: First, the defmition. We define the business area clearly, and determine the goal of data mining. Second, data preparation. Data preparation includes the selection of data that extract the target data set from large databases and data warehouse, data preprocessing and data reprocessing that check data integrity and data consistency, eliminate noise, fill the missing fields, remove the invalid data, etc. Third, data mining. According to the data function types and characteristics of the data, we select the appropriate algorithm, and Conduct data mining in the purified and the converted data. Fourth, the fmal analysis. We  interpret and evaluate the results of data mining, convert into the knowledge of the user to understand. Fifth, the use of knowledge. We integrate the knowledge analyzed into the organizational fabric of business information systems.

N. ASSOCIATION RULES  A. Definitions  Association rule induction is one of the most well-known approaches in data mining techniques. This technique was initially applied to the so-called market basket analysis, which aims at finding regularities in shopping behavior of customers of supermarkets. In particular, these kinds of rules, which are called Boolean association rules, try to identify sets of products (items) that are frequently bought together in a transaction. A discovered rule can tell, for example, people who buy butter and milk will also buy bread.

Association rule mining is to find the interesting connections between items of a given data set. Database T is a collection of n transactions, {T), T2, ... , Tn} and I is the set of all items, {i), i2, ..., im}, where each of the transactions TiCl ~ j ~ n) in the database T represents a set of items (Tj c; 1). An item set is defmed as a non-empty subset of 1. An association rule can be represented as: X+Y(c, s), where Xc;I, YCI and X n Y = 1> . In this association rule, s is called support and c is confidence of the association rule. The support is the percentage of the transactions in which both X and Y appear in the same transaction and the confidence is the ratio of the number of transactions that contain both X and Y to the number of transactions that contain only X. It can be described as follows:  Support (X---->Y) = P (X U Y) Confidence (X---->Y) = P (y IX)  B. Apriori algorithm  Apriori algorithm is an influential frequent itemset algorithm in Boolean association rules. It was designed by R.

Agrawal in 1993. This algorithm proposed follows: all non- empty subset of frequent itemset must also be frequent. If the itemset I does not meet the minimum support, I was not frequent. If the itemsets J is added to I, the itemset IUJ can not be more frequent than 1. So illJ is not frequent. This feature is called anti-monotone. It means that if a collection is not frequent, all ofhis super-set also can not be frequent.

The basic Apriori algorithm works in two steps. First, it finds frequent itemsets for Boolean association rules, receiving as input a database T of transactions and the minimum support for the rules. In the second step association rules are generated from the frequent itemsets found in the first step. Usually the first step is more important, because it accounts for the greater part of the processing time. It exploits the Apriori property which is based on the simple observation that no superset of an infrequent itemset (i.e., an itemset not having minimum support) can be frequent (can have enough support).

Apriori algorithm uses the iterative method of layer search- itemset k- for the exploration itemset (k + 1) -. First find out a set 1- of the itemsets. The set denoted by Ll. Ll is used to find the set L2 of frequent set 2-, and L2 look for L3, it goes on until the can not find frequent itemset k-. Each Lk need to find a database scan.

Such detection methods for known intrusion patterns and system defects can accurately identify. Detection process is simple, fast, high accuracy and low false positive rate. It can be made to reflect different patterns depending on the attack.

However, due to a wide range of means and methods of attack, and in the growing technological complexity, and misuse detection rely mainly on existing attack pattern database, it can not cover all invasive methods and not detect unknown the system attacks.

Retired Children Salary  Yes 2 0  No 1 20,000  Yes 2 15,000  Given a database T with attributes I and the defmitions of fuzzy sets associated with attributes in I, the objective is to find out some interesting regularities between attribute values in a guided way. Any fuzzy association rule is in the following form: IfX is A then Y is B. (1)  In the above rule, X = {Xj, X2, ..., xp} and Y = {yj, Y2, ..., yq} are attribute sets. X and Yare disjoint subsets of 1. A =  {fx"fx" ... ,fx) and B = {fYl,fY2, ... ,fy) contain the fuzzy sets associated with the corresponding attributes in X and  y. For example.( E F is a fuzzy set, defmed on Xk domain.J Xk Xk  The core of algorithm is as follows ? Lj=fmd-frequent_l-itemsets(D); ? For (k=2; Lk_j:;t:<1>, k++) do begin ? Ck=apriori-gen (Lk_j, min_sup) ; ? for all transactions tED do begin ? Ct=subset (Ck, 1) : ? for all candidates c E Ct do ? c.count++; ? end ? Lk={cECklsupport (c) >=min-sup};  ? end ? Answer=UKLK  C. Fuzzy association nile  As stated before, Apriori algorithm can only be used to induce Boolean association rules, fuzzy association rule induction to handle this problem. A brief description of the approach is provided here.

Let T = {tj, t2, ... , in} be the database and ti represents the ith record in T. Moreover, I = {ij, i2, ..., im} is used to represents all attributes appeared in T and ij represents the jth attribute. Table 1 is a sample database with quantitative attributes. In this example T = {tj, t2, t3} and I = {retired, children, salary}. We can retrieve the value of attribute ik in the jth record simply by tj [ik]. For example if we want to know the value of Salary of the second record, we can use t2[salary] and get the value 20,000.

Besides, each attribute ik is associated with several fuzzy  sets. F = {.(1 .(2... .(l} represents the set of fuzzy sets It J it ' J it' , J it  associated with ik, and .(] represents the jth fuzzy set in F .

J~ ~  For example, if the attribute Salary has three fuzzy sets defined for it, e.g. high, medium, and low, we have Fsalary = {high, medium, low}. The fuzzy sets and the corresponding membership functions are provided by domain experts or obtained through an automated approach.

I) = { QjEA I } Q j  Q j  I } 0 otherwise  in which, w is a threshold used to avoid taking low membership values into account. As it can be observed in (2),  operator IT (mul) is used to compute each record' s vote.

The second step in fuzzy association rule induction is  generating rules using the large itemsets induced in the first step, considering certainty factor.

Let (Z, C) be a large itemset. Any fuzzy association rule induced from this large itemset will be in the form 'if X is then Y is B', where XCZ, Y = Z-X, ACC and B = C-A.

Certainty factor for this rule is calculated as follows.

C _ I t,ET IT Zt EZ {aCt (ti I Zk I)} {(X,A),(Y,B)} - " IT {a (t Ix I)}  ~ ~.ET XjEX Q) 1 }  Where  Each pair of (xk,Ix) or (Yk' Iy) is called an item, and each pair of (X, A) or (Y, B) is called an itemset.

The first part of the rule 'X is A' is called the antecedent and 'Y is B' is called the consequent of the rule. The semantics of the rule is when 'X is A' is satisfied, we can imply that 'Y is B' is also satisfied. Here the word "satisfied" means there are sufficient amount 0 f records which contribute their votes to the attribute/fuzzy set pairs and the sum of these votes is greater than a user specified threshold.

An appropriate rule should have enough significance and a high certainty factor. Significance and certainty factor are two concepts, equivalent to support and confidence that were introduced by Agrawal in the domain of Boolean association rules.

Fuzzy association rule induction algorithm has two steps.

As in Apriori algorithm, the first step is to fmd the so-called large itemsets which are itemsets with significance higher than a user specified threshold. The significance factor of an itemset is calculated by first summing all votes of each record with respect to that itemset, then dividing it by the total number of records.

Let X = {Xj, X2, ..., xp}be a set of attributes and A = {aj,  a2, ... , ap}be a set of fuzzy sets, such that ajE F: and also let j  {m ,m ,... , m }be the set of membership functions of A, "t a, Q p  such that m represents the membership function of aj. The Q  j  following formula is used to calculate the significance factor of (X, A) ,i.e. S eX,A) .
