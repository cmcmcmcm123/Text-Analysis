Spatial Constraint Topology Association Rules  Mining Based on Apriori

Abstract?This paper proposes an algorithm of mining spatial topology association rules with constraint condition based on Apriori, which is used to mining spatial multilayer transverse association rules with constraint condition from large spatial database. This algorithm generates candidate frequent topological item sets via up search strategy similar to Apriori, which is suitable for mining short spatial topological frequent item sets with constraint condition. This algorithm compresses storage structure of spatial topological relation to create an integer. Via this method, firstly, the algorithm may efficiently reduce some storage space of mining database. Secondly, the algorithm is effortless to distinguish topological relation of two spatial objects, namely, it may fast compute support of candidate item sets. Finally, the algorithm is fast to connect (k+1)-candidate item sets of k-frequent item set by up search strategy. The result of experiment indicates that the algorithm of mining spatial topology association rules with constraint condition based on Apriori is able to extract spatial multilayer transverse association rules with constraint condition from spatial database via efficient data store, and it is very efficient to extract short frequent topology association rules with constraint condition.

I.  INTRODUCTION The research and application of spatial data mining have  become more and more important for people. Spatial association rules is one of important part of spatial data mining, which mainly extracts these interactions, spatial dependency and spatial symbiosis patterns with spatial objects as in [1].

Nowadays, traditional association rules is expanded to spatial data mining, there are mainly three kinds methods of mining spatial association rules as in [2], such as, layer covered based on clustering as in [2], mining approach based on spatial transaction as in [3, 4 and 5] and mining approach based on non-spatial transaction as in [2]. Mining approach based on spatial transaction uses spatial overlying and buffer analysis to search spatial predicate of spatial objectives and other objects in spatial database, and extracts Boolean association rules from spatial transaction database formed by these spatial predicate.

This method is used to mining monolayer transverse association rules and multilayer transverse association rules, which is one of wide applied techniques. Spatial topological relation is one of typical and important multilayer spatial  relation. And so, this paper uses mining approach based on spatial transaction to introduce an algorithm of mining spatial topology association rules with constraint condition based on Apriori, denoted by MSTARCC, which uses spatial topological relation as example to present multilayer spatial association rules mining with constraint condition.



II. RUDIMENTARY KNOWLEDGE As we all know this rudimentary knowledge as in [1, 2],  rudimentary knowledge of spatial topology association rules with constraint condition is expressed as follows:  Spatial association rules mainly contain three parts as follows, spatial association among properties of the same objects in the same spatial relation pattern, spatial association among different objects in the same spatial relation pattern and spatial association among different objects in the different spatial relation pattern. The first part is known as spatial lengthwise association, the second and third parts are known as spatial transverse association. Association rules expressing as the second spatial relation is known as monolayer transverse spatial association rules. Association rules expressing as the third spatial relation is known as multilayer transverse spatial association rules. According to mining approach based on spatial transaction, this algorithm uses spatial topological relation as example to extract multilayer spatial association rules with constraint condition, and so we only thick seven kinds of spatial topology association as table I.

Definition 1 Spatial Transaction to Binary Digit, a spatial transaction expressing topological relation is denoted by binary digit.

The course of turning spatial transaction into binary digit is expressed as follows:  Step1, we define target object class and non-target object class, target object class is denoted by Ot. There are m non- target objects classes, which are denoted by ik (k=1?m).

Step2, we use 3 non-zero binary digits to denote a kind of topological relation that expresses sole spatial topological relation between target object and non-target object.

Step3, the number of bit is 3 times the number of classes in non-target objects of spatial transaction database.

This work was fully supported by science and technology research projects of Chongqing Education Commission (Project No. KJ061101 and KJ091108), and it was also fully supported by science and technology research projects of Chongqing Three Gorges University (Project No. 10QN- 22, 24 and 30).

Step4, spatial topological relation is denoted by binary digit as following table I.

TABLE I.  SPATIAL TOPOLOGICAL RELATION  No. Topological relation Spatial Predicate Binary Digit 1 disjoint disjoint (Ot, ik) (001)2 2 touch touch (Ot, ik) (010)2 3 overlap overlap (Ot, ik) (011)2 4 cover cover (Ot, ik) (100)2 5 contain contain (Ot, ik) (101)2 6 covered covered (Ot, ik) (110)2 7 inside inside (Ot, ik) (111)2  Here, we let (000)2 express this spatial relation that there are no non-target objects in buffer of target objects.

Example, item sets of spatial non-target objects class is expressed as I = {i1, i2, i3, i4, i5}, we also define the order of binary digit according to the order of item sets.

Suppose here is an entity of target object class denoted by Ot, Ot is inside of an entity of non-target object class as i2, spatial predicate is denoted by inside (Ot, i2), namely, binary digit is expressed as (111)2. Ot touches an entity of non-target object class as i3, spatial predicate is denoted by touch (Ot, i3), namely, binary digit is expressed as (010)2. Ot contains an entity of non-target object class as i4, spatial predicate is denoted by contain (Ot, i4), namely, binary digit is expressed as (101)2. All the entities of two non-target objects class as i1 and i5 are not in the buffer of the entity of target object class as Ot.

The spatial topological relation may be expressed as Fig. 1, we also may use (000, 111, 010, 101, 000)2 express the spatial topological relation.

Figure 1.  The spatial topological relation  Definition 2 Topological Relation Bit, it is a binary digit with 3 bit, which expresses a kind of topological relation between two entities of target object class and non-target object class.

Example, if a spatial transaction is denoted as a binary digit (000, 111, 010, 101, 000)2, we think (111)2, (010)2 and (101)2 as Topological Relation Bit.

Definition 3 Spatial Transaction to Integer, a spatial transaction expressing spatial topological relation is denoted by an integer.

Example, if a spatial transaction is denoted by this binary digit (000, 111, 010, 101, 000)2, we will use this integer 3752 to express this spatial transaction.

Definition 4 Spatial Transaction Length, which is denoted as STL. Its value equals the number of non-target objects class  in buffer of entity of target object class. Namely, it also equals the number of spatial topological relation between two entities of target object class and non-target object class.

Example, the spatial transaction as Fig.1 is expressed as {inside (Ot, i2), touch (Ot, i3), contain (Ot, i4)}, which is expressed as binary digit p = (000, 111, 010, 101, 000)2, its length equals to 3, namely, STL (p) = 3.

Definition 5 Transaction Relation to Integer Relation, a spatial transaction ST1 is expressed as integer I1, another ST2 is expressed as integer I2, if ST1 ? ST2, and we will define I1 ? I2.

Example, item sets of non-target spatial object class is expressed as I = {i1, i2, i3, i4, i5}. Let ST1 be {inside (Ot, i2), touch (Ot, i3), contain (Ot, i4)}, denoted by 3752, let ST2 be {inside (Ot, i2), contain (Ot, i4)}, denoted by 3624. Obviously, ST2 ? ST1, and then we record 3624 ? 3752.

Definition 6 Constraint Condition, denoted by CC, it is made of some non-target objects classes given by user, and it is also pure subset of spatial non-target objects class sets.

Example, item sets of non-target spatial object class is expressed as I = {i1, i2, i3, i4, i5}, CC ?  I, such as {i2, i5}.

Property 1 There are two binary digits p and q with m Topological Relation Bits, p is used to express a spatial transaction STp, q is used to express a spatial transaction STq.

The necessary and sufficient condition for STp ? STq is p ? q = p, and STL (q? (~p)) = STL (q) ? STL (p).

Proving of sufficient condition is expressed as follows:  We use TRBi express value of No.i Topological Relation Bit in a binary digit.

Suppose, TRBi ? 0 (i = j1, j2?jk, k<m) in this binary digit p, and others are 0. In these Topological Relation Bits, we let No.bs (s =1, 2?t, t ? 3m) binary bit be 1, and others are 0. For p ? q = p, and so in these Topological Relation Bits of q, these No.bs (s =1, 2?t, t ? 3m) binary bits are all equal to 1 (otherwise, p ? q ?  p), and others are 0 or 1.

And for STL(q?(~p))= STL(q) - STL(p), and so TRBi ?  0 (i = j1, j2?jk, k<m) in this binary digit q are all equal to the same Topological Relation Bit in this binary digit p (otherwise, STL(q?(~p)) ?  STL(q) - STL(p)), and others are 0 or 1. As definition 1 and 5, we know STp ?  STq.

Proving of necessary condition is expressed as follows:  Suppose, TRBi ? 0 (i = j1, j2?jk, k<m) in this binary digit p, and others are 0. In these Topological Relation Bits, we let No.bs (s =1, 2?t, t ? 3m) binary bit be 1, and others are 0. For STp ? STq, according to definition 1 and 5, and so TRBi ?  0 (i = j1, j2?jk, k<m) in this binary digit q are all equal to the same Topological Relation Bit in this binary digit p (otherwise, here is No.jk spatial topological relation, it belongs to STp, but it doesn?t belong to STq, this contradicts with STp ? STq), and so in these Topological Relation Bits of binary digit q, these No.bs (s =1, 2?t, t ? 3m) binary bits are all 1, and others are 0. And so the rest of binary bits in binary digit q are 0 or 1. Hence, p ? q = p, and STL (q? (~p)) = STL (q) ? STL (p).

Deduction 1 There are two binary digits p and q. If p is turned into integer Ip, q is turned into integer Iq, and p ? q = p, and Ip ? Iq.

Deduction 2 Let integer Ip express a spatial transaction STp, and let integer Iq express a spatial transaction STq. If Iq ? Ip, and STp ? STq.

Property 2 Let binary digit p express spatial transaction STp, and let binary digit q express spatial transaction STq. And p ? q = p, and STL (q? (~p)) = STL (q) ? STL (p).

If STq is a frequent item set, and STp is also a frequent item set.

If STp is not a frequent item set, and STq is not also a frequent item set.



III. MINING SPATIAL TOPOLOGY ASSOCIATION RULES WITH CONSTRAINT CONDIOTION  A. Forming Transaction Database In order to form mining database of spatial topology  association rules, from original spatial database, we need make each spatial transaction turn into an integer. The course of turning used by the algorithm is expressed as follows:  Firstly, we define target object class O and non-target object class ik (k=1?m), and then define the order of non- target object class as I = {i1, i2?im}.

Secondly, each non-target objects class Ik existing in spatial transaction has an order denoted by Nk. If there is a kind of spatial topological relation as table I between entities of target object class and non-target object class Ik, obviously, according to definition 1 and 2, this spatial topological relation is able to be denoted by some Topological Relation Bit as table I.

Thirdly, then we will put this Topological Relation Bit into No.k location.

Finally, we will gain a binary digit with 3m bit, and then turn the binary digit into integer.

According to this way, the algorithm will gain an integer by scanning each spatial transaction, and mining database is formed of these integers.

Now we save these integers by this data structure expressed as follows:  Structure spatial transaction {  Int Digit; // saving integer expressed as spatial transaction  Int Count; // saving the sum of same integer expressed as spatial transaction} ST  Example, here is three entities of target objects class as O1, O2 and O3, and non-target object class I = {i1, i2, i3, i4, i5}.

No.1 spatial transaction ST1 is expressed as {overlap (O1, i2), contain (O1, i3), covered (O1, i4)}, we use binary digit p = (000, 011, 101, 110, 000)2 to express this spatial transaction, namely, this integer 1904 may express ST1.

ST [1].Digit=1904, ST [1].Count=1.

No.2 spatial transaction ST2 is expressed as {overlap (O2, i3), inside (O2, i4)}, we use binary digit p = (000, 000, 011, 111, 000)2 to express this spatial transaction, namely, this integer 31 may express ST2.

ST [2].Digit=31, ST [2].Count=1.

No.3 spatial transaction ST3 is expressed as {overlap (O3, i2), contain (O3, i3), covered (O3, i4)}, we use binary digit p = (000, 011, 101, 110, 000)2 to express this spatial transaction, namely, this integer 1904 may express ST3. As this information has been saved, we only add 1 to Count.

ST [1].Digit=1904, ST [1].Count=2.

?  B. Generating frequent topological item sets with constraint condition The course of generating frequent topological item sets  with constraint condition is similar to Apriori, namely, according to up search strategy, the algorithm uses three stages to generate frequent topological item sets with constraint condition, which is expressed as follows:  Firstly, the algorithm computes all these 1-topological item sets, and gains all the 1-frequent topological item sets.

Secondly, the algorithm connects 1-frequent topological item sets to generate these entire 2-candidate frequent topological item sets.

Finally, the algorithm computes (k+1)-candidate frequent topological item sets with constraint condition (k>1), and generates all these (k+1)-frequent topological item sets with constraint condition by iteration connecting.

C. The method of computing support According to the principle of property 1, we know that the  method of computing support includes two steps as follows:  Let an integer Iq express a spatial transaction STq, let another Ip express a candidate frequent item sets CSTp with constraint condition.

Step1, the algorithm computes this expression Ip ? Iq , if Ip ? Iq ?  Ip, we will know that CSTp ? STq, namely, the spatial transaction STq does not support candidate frequent item sets CSTp, and stop computing support. If Ip ? Iq = Ip, then going to step2.

Step2, if STL(Iq?(~Ip)) = STL(Iq) - STL(Ip), and CSTp ? STq.

And so we will know that the spatial transaction STq supports candidate frequent item sets CSTp. Otherwise, the spatial transaction STq does not support candidate frequent item sets CSTp.

D. The process of mining topology association rules with constraint condition According to the up search strategy similar to Apriori, the  process of mining topology rules with constraint condition is expressed as follows:    Step1, the algorithm computes all these 1-topological item sets, and gains all the 1-frequent topological item sets.

Step2, the algorithm connects 1-frequent topological item sets to generate these entire 2-candidate frequent topological item sets.

Step3, the algorithm computes (k+1)-candidate frequent topological item sets with constraint condition, and generates all these (k+1)-frequent topological item sets (k>1) by iteration connecting.

Step4, the algorithm outputs all frequent topological item sets with constraint condition.

Step5, according to confidence given by user, the algorithm computes all topology association rules with constraint condition.



IV. THE ANALYSIS AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULT OF ALGORITHM  Nowadays, there are very little documents of research spatial topology association rules with constraint condition.

Here we only present the capability and experimental result of the algorithm:  A. The Analysis of Capability The algorithm is suitable for mining short frequent  topological item sets with constraint condition because it adopts up search strategy to generate candidate frequent topological item sets with constraint condition. The algorithm realizes fast mining spatial multilayer transverse association rules with constraint condition from spatial database because it compresses a kind of spatial topological relation to create an integer, namely, it adopts an efficient data store of spatial topological relation compressing.

B. The experimental result of the algorithm Now we use experiment to prove above analyses. The  mining algorithms (MSTARCC) is used to generate frequent topological item sets with constraint condition from 71650 spatial transactions, which are denoted by integer from 1 to 4095, the constraint condition is expressed as CC1 = 5, which expresses {contain(O?D)}, the another is expressed as CC2 = 10, which expresses {disjoint (O?C)?touch (O?D)}. O is target object class, C is the third non-target object class, and D is the fourth non-target object class. The number of spatial non- target object class is denoted by m=4.

These spatial transactions observe the discipline which is expressed as follows:  Spatial transaction denoted by 4095 has five instances.

Spatial transaction denoted by 4094 has thirty instances.

Spatial transaction denoted by 4093 has five instances.

Spatial transaction denoted by 4092 has thirty instances.

?  The runtime of the algorithms is expressed as Fig.2 as support changes for CC = 5 and CC = 10.

Our experimental circumstances are expressed as follows: Intel(R) Celeron(R) M CPU 420 ? 1.60 GHz, 1GB, language of the procedure is Visual C# 2005.NET, OS is Windows XP Professional.
