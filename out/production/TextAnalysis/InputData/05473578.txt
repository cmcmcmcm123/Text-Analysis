Mining Frequent Patterns from Software Defect Repositories for Black-box Testing

Abstract?Software defects are usually detected by inspec- tion, black-box testing or white-box testing. Current software defect mining work focuses on mining frequent patterns with- out distinguishing these different kinds of defects, and mining with respect to defect type can only give limited guidance on software development due to overly broad classification of defect type. In this paper, we present four kinds of frequent patterns from defects detected by black-box testing (called black-box defect) based on a kind of detailed classification named ODC-BD (Orthogonal Defect Classification for Black- box Defect). The frequent patterns include the top 10 conditions (data or operation) which most easily result in defects or severe defects, the top 10 defect phenomena which most frequently occur and have a great impact on users, association rules between function modules and defect types. We aim to help project managers, black-box testers and developers improve the efficiency of software defect detection and analysis using these frequent patterns. Our study is based on 5023 defect reports from 56 large industrial projects and 2 open source projects.

I. INTRODUCTION  In software development, managers, developers or testers often try to find some interesting patterns from defect reports in order to improve their software quality. It is difficult to analysis these defects manually for the lager number of defects. Therefore, frequent pattern mining [1] from defect repositories has started playing an important role in software defect detection and analysis. In frequent pattern mining, frequent itemsets and association rules mining are two important research topics.

Associated defects are very common in large defect repositories. The correlation of defects can be divided into two types: lateral correlation and longitudinal correlation.

We call it lateral correlation if the same type of defect occurred in a function, may occur in other similar functions.

And longitudinal correlation means if some types of defect occurred in a function, may affect the other associated function modules due to the close relationship of these function modules. To detect and remove the correlation defects, it is essential to extract the association rules of function modules and defect types using association rules mining.

As we known, defects are usually detected by inspection, black-box testing or white-box testing. In these three ap- proaches, the black-box testing is used more widely than inspection and white-box testing in different software devel- opment activities, thus frequent pattern mining from black- box defect repositories are vital for software development.

Current software defect mining works haven?t distinguished these different kinds of defects, but the feature of defects detected by these approaches is very different.

In this paper, we aim to mining frequent patterns from black-box defect repositories based on ODC-BD (Orthog- onal Defect Classification for Black-box Defect) [2]. We collect 5023 defect reports from 56 large industrial projects and 2 open source projects. In this paper, we refer to the defect that detected by black-box testing as the ?black-box defect?.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we give a brief overview of some existing related frequent pattern mining work. Section III introduces the background of ODC- BD and related concepts. In Section IV, we describe our study about frequent itemsets and association rules mining from black-box defects, and report the experiment result that mainly includes four kinds of frequent patterns. Finally Section V concludes the paper and outlines further work.



II. RELATED WORK  Frequent pattern mining has been a focused theme in datamining research for over a decade. It was first proposed by Agrawal et al. for market basket analysis in the form of association rule mining [3]. Since the first proposal of this new data mining task and algorithms, there have been hundreds of follow-up research works [1], [4], [5].

Frequent itemsets mining is a basic issue in frequent pattern mining. There are three basic frequent itemsets mining methodologies: Apriori [6], FP-growth [7] and Eclat [8]. Many other mining methodologies extended from these three methods. Apriori principle and apriori algorithm was firstly introduced by Agrawal et al in 1993. Compared with Apriori, FP-growth method proposed by Han et al. mines the complete set of frequent itemsets without candidate generation, thus the cost of space and time was reduced.

Both the Apriori and FP-growth methods mine frequent patterns from a set of transactions in horizontal data format,     Table I ATTRIBUTES OF ODC-BD  Attribute Description  Function Module Indicates associated function mod- ule names.

Defect Type Indicates the type of the defect phenomenon ,operation or data.

Age Indicates the history of the defect.

Quality Characteristics Indicates software quality charac- teristics which the defect affected.

Property Indicates the defect is bug or just enhancement.

Processing Priority Indicates which defect reports should be handled firstly.

Influence Degree Indicates the influence of the defect on the user.

Zaki proposed Equivalence CLASS Transformation (Eclat) algorithm by exploring the vertical data format.

In recent years, mining software repositories have become an important area of frequent pattern mining. Song et al. mined associations rules using defect data [9]. They focused on defect type and defect correction effort. They applied the proposed methods to the NASA SEL defect data set. In the SEL Data, the defects are divided into six types: Computational, Data value, Internal interface, External interface, Initialization and Logic/control structure defect. They resulted in a total of 60 sets of rules with respect to defect type, but the rules can only give limited guidance for software developers due to the overly broad defect types.

None of the above-cited studies contained frequent pattern mining for black-box defects. To provide more detailed guidance to detect black-box defects for black-box testers and assist project managers in allocating testing resources, we present frequent itemsets and association rules in black- box defect based on ODC-BD in this paper.



III. BACKGROUND  A. Black-box Defect Classification Scheme: ODC-BD  We mining frequent patterns from black-box defects which are classified according to a kind of classification scheme named ODC-BC. ODC-BD is designed for analyz- ing software black-box defect for black-box tester. Table I lists all attributes of ODC-BD.

The defect type classification of ODC-BD is composed of four levels. The top level is composed of five categories: Function Defect, System Defect, Data Defect, Interface Defect, Specific Defect. In total, there are 300 detailed defect types for black-box defect. The detailed values of defect type are listed in [2]. In this paper, we focus on frequent patterns related to defect type.

B. Related Concepts and Mining Algorithm  Let I = {i1, i2, ..., ik} be a set of items. A subset of I is called an itemset or a k-itemset if it contains k items.

Let a database D = {d1, d2, ..., dm} be a set of transactions in the database. Each transaction in D contains a subset of the items in I . Frequent itemset A means the support (supp(A)) is greater than some user-specified minimum support threshold. And supp(A) is defined as the probability of transactions in the D which contains A.

An association rule is an expression A ? B, where A ? I , B ? I , and A ? B = ?. The interestingness of an association rule is measured by both support and confidence, which respectively reflect the usefulness and certainty of the rule. For a certain rule A ? B, the support supp(A ? B) is defined as the probability of transactions in the D which contains both A and B (1), and the confidence of this rule is defined as the conditional probability of transactions in the D which contains B given has already contained A (2).

supp(A ? B) = P (A ?  B) (1)  conf(A ? B) = P (B|A) = supp(A ? B) supp(A)  (2)  In our study, we mining frequent itemsets and association rules using basic Apriori algorithm. The essence of the Apriori algorithm is: a k-itemsets is frequent only if all of its sub-itemsets are frequent. This implies that frequent itemsets can be mined by first scanning the database to find the frequent 1-itemsets, then using the frequent 1-itemsets to generate candidate frequent 2-itemsets, and check against the database to obtain the frequent 2-itemsets. This process iterates until no more frequent k-itemsets can be generated for some k. The detailed algorithm is described in [6].



IV. EXPERIMENT  A. Defect Data  We collect 5023 defect reports from industrial projects and open source projects. The defect data can be divided into three groups: defects of industrial projects in which we work as a professional tester, defects of industrial projects in which we work as a developer and defects of open source projects. Carrying out the study on these various projects helps to generalize our conclusions.

We select 3634 black-box defect reports distributed in 56 industrial projects over more than 10 years. The industrial projects involve many different types: software project de- velop management, video processing, storage management, software development environment, job management (mid- dleware), network monitoring, etc. They are developed by different language (java, c, c++, c#, asp.net, jsp, vb, etc) and executed on diverse platform (Windows, Unix, Linux). Some software has GUI (Graphical User Interface), but some only has command line user interface.

We also selected 1389 black-box defect reports in last one year from two large open source projects: the Eclipse    Table II CLASSIFICATION SAMPLE: DEFECT TYPE  BugNo Conditions Results  443 C113; C197 R212; R226  project1 and the Firefox project2. To remove invalid defect reports for us, we add ?resolution? to bug search condition, we only filtered defects that their resolution is ?FIXED? or ?WONTFIX?. As we known, the bug report of open source projects can be submitted by anyone, so bug may be detected by white-box testing (or code level), may be detected by black-box testing (or non-code level). We remove non black- box defects manually.

These original bug reports include a succinct summary, a longer free-text description (which may include conditions and steps to reproduce it, or information from the error messages/logs, core dumps) and some other attributes such as tester, test date, status, etc.

B. Methodology  The objective of the study is to discover software defect frequent patterns with respect to defect type from historical software defect repositories.

For this purpose, firstly, we classified these 5023 black- box defect reports according to the seven attributes of ODC- BD, including function module, defect type, age, quality characteristics, property, processing priority and influence degree. It is noticeable that one defect report can be assigned several function modules and defect types. The description of defect usually includes occurred condition (data or oper- ation) and result(phenomenon). Therefore, we distinguished whether a defect type is a condition or a result for a certain defect.

For example, the defect description of Bug-443 is as fol- lows: Incorrect error message box is showed when importing dropdown items if import file is empty. And when clicking the ?OK? button of the error message box, the software instead of the error message box is closed. We classified the defect type of this bug reports as Table II. The number in conditions and results is the No. of ODC-BD?s defect type [2], such as No.C113 is ?Empty/0 byte/empty row/empty column file?, No.C197 is ?File import and export?, No.R212 is ?Message format and content error?, and No.R226 is ?Page location/jump error?.

Secondly we mining frequent itemsets and association rules about defect type from classified defect data using Apriori algorithm. To meet our needs, we firstly mining single-dimension data of defect type from different per- spective: condition, result and combination of condition and result, then mining multi-dimension data with respect to defect type.

1https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/ 2https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/  Finally we analyze the results of mining manually. The detailed result is described in next section.

C. Mining Result - Frequent Items and Association Rules  We mined four kinds of frequent patterns from different perspective.

1) Top 10 defect types acting as defect condition: The mining result shows the conditions (data or operation) which most easily result in defects. It tells testers how to design the conditions of test case by which defects can be found more easily. The percent in brackets means the support.

? Nonexistent value/object[8.61%] ? Boundary value [8.44%] ? Specific characters [6.33%] ? Null value [5.62%] ? Large/long/deep value [5.45%] ? Unmatched type/format data [4.39%] ? Same/equal value [3.69%] ? Move/Drag&Drop [3.69%] ? Operation repeatedly [2.99%] ? Concurrent operation [2.46%] Among these conditions, ?Nonexistent value/object?  should be noticed. In order to build the condition, special operations are often needed. For example, concurrent oper- ation, or delete the value/object ahead by other ways.

2) Top 10 defect types acting as defect result with a high influence degree: These defect phenomena let developers and testers notice these points in development. We exclude trivial defect types like ?Function error in any case? from original mining results. The percent in brackets means the support.

? Do not catch/handle exception [8.18%] ? Abnormal graphic interface(no response, can not dis-  play, etc) [7.06%] ? Control status abnormally(enable/disable,edit or not,  selected or not,hidden or not) [4.09%] ? Control abnormally(not work or function error) [3.07%] ? Abort/Crash [2.66%] ? Data content error in reading or writing[2.35%] ? Data/Associated data is not/can not be modified  [2.35%] ? Data/Associated data is not/can not be deleted [1.84%] ? Can not stop/Endless loop [1.74%] ? Data/Associated data is not/can not be added [1.64%] 3) Association rules between defect type: The mined  association rules indicate which kind of conditions most easily lead to severe defects listed above 2). Compared with the first frequent pattern, this pattern focused on not only defect type but also influence degree to users. We mined more than 1,000 rules, so do not list them all, but instead describe the typical forms and describe some important results.

? C72;C169 ? D210[85.2%]    ? C90 ? D210[76.4%] ? C179 ? D210;D222[68.5%] The number in association rules is like as Table II, such as  No.C72 is ?Nonexistent value/object?, No.D210 is ?Do not catch/handle exception? and No.D222 is ?Abnormal graphic interface(no response, can not display, etc)?. From mined as- sociation rules, we know the defects of No.D210 or No.D222 occurs with a high probability if tester testing with the condition of ?Boundary value?, ?Nonexistent value/object?, or ?Encoding?.

4) Association Rules between Function Module and De- fect Type: A black-box defect is certainly associated one or more than one function modules. The mined association rules are helpful to remove the correlation defects. As a function module belongs to a certain project, it is meaningful to mining association rules only from one project?s defects.

To evaluate our approach, we mining from 253 defects of one project. There are 8 modules labeled as ?A? to ?H?.

Among mined association rules, there are two typical rules, the forms are as follows.

? A ? C[82.2%] ? E.C68 ? H.D162[89.4%] A ? C in above rules shows defects occurred in both  module A and module C with a high probability. We can get a clue that module A and module C have a close correlation, thus module C should be emphasized to test when testing module A. And the second rule indicates No.D162 occurred in module H with a high probability when No.C68 occurring in module E. Here No.C68 is ?Boundary value? and No.D162 is ?Calculation overflow error?. The rule tells testers that they should confirm whether ?Calculation overflow error? occurs or not in module H when testing module E with boundary value.



V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  In this paper, we presented four kinds of frequent patterns mining from 5023 black-box defect reports classified by defect classification named ODC-BD. Our contribution is described as follows: (1)Present the top 10 black-box defect types acting as the condition of defect, that means defects are most likely to occur under these 10 kinds of condition (data or operation). It will tell testers how to design the conditions of test case by which defects can be found more quickly. (2)Present the top 10 defect types acting as defect phenomena that influence degree is high. It shows the most frequently occurred defect phenomena which have a great impact on users. (3)Present frequent association rules between defect types that indicate which kinds of conditions most easily lead to severe defects listed in section IV.

Compared with the first frequent pattern, this pattern focused on not only defect type but also influence degree to users.

(4)Present frequent associations between function modules and defect types. The association rules will help testers  detect and remove the correlation defects. In particular, it is very helpful when do regression testing after fixing a defect. In summary, project managers, black-box testers and developers can substantially benefit from these four mining results in allocating testing resources, detecting defect and analyzing the result of testing. In the future, we will extend our study with several aspects: try to analyze black-box defect using cause effect graph based on ODC-BC; predict black-box defect number and distribution according to defect type.
