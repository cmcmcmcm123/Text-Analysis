Insights into the Combinatorial Effects of Histone  Modifications in Yeast Using Association Rule

Abstract-Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into chromatin by histone proteins whose chemical modification can profoundly influence gene expression. The histone modifications often act in  combinations, which exert different effects on gene expression.

Although a number of experimental techniques and data analysis methods have been developed to study histone modifications, it is  still very difficult to identify the relationships among histone modifications on a genome-wide scale. We proposed a method to identify the combinatorial effects of histone modifications by association rule mining. The method first identified Functional Modification Transactions (FMTs) and then employed association rule mining algorithm and statistics methods to identify histone modification patterus. Our method succeeds in revealing two different global views of histone modification  landscapes on two distinct datasets and identifying a number of modification patterns some of which are supported by previous studies. We concentrate on combinatorial effects of histone  modifications which significantly affect gene expression. Our method succeeds in identifying known interactions among histone modifications and uncovering many previously unknown patterns. Our results also demonstrate several histone modification patterns which show significant correspondence  between yeast and human cells.



I. BACKGROUND  This document Gene activities in eukaryotic cells are mainly regulated by transcription factors and chromatin structure. Chromatin fibers are composed of polymers of nucleosomes, which are the fundamental units of chromatin.

The nucleosome contains a histone octamer consisting of two sets of four core histones (H3, H4, H2A, H2B) wrapped by 147 base pairs of DNA [1], [2]. On the one hand, the histones cover the DNA and prevent the genetic information from being accessed by many biological machineries, such as transcription, replication and recombination. On the other hand, the histones can be altered by the post-translational chemical modifications, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and sumoylation, through which the interactions between histones and DNA can be altered [3], [4]. Among them, histone acetylation leads to a reduction of positive charges on the histone tails and leads to an open chromatin state, which is often associated with increased gene expression [5], [6]; histone methylation links to both gene activation and gene repression depending on its site and extent of methylation, and different effects may be    associated with mono-, di-, or trimethylation of lysine residues [7], [8].

According to histone code hypothesis, covalent posttranslational modification of histone tails act sequentially or in combination to form a 'histone code' that is read by other proteins to bring about distinct downstream events [9].

We believe that histone modifications function in a manner rated to their combinatorial effects rather than individual effect. Many methods have been proposed to find the combinatorial effects. On the one hand, a number of experimental techniques have been developed to study histone modifications, such as, ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq. On the other hand, some data analysis methods have been introduced to reveal the relationships between histone modification sites, such as, clustering methods [10], [11] and correlation analysis [12], [13]. But there are several disadvantages of the above methods. Specifically, clustering methods are good at clustering under all sites but difficult to cluster under subset of all sites, hence, they fail to identify whether the sites are functional or not. Correlation analysis can only reveal pairwise correlation between each pair of sites. In order to solve above problems, we proposed a method of association rule mining which not only overcomes aforesaid shortcomings but also successfully identifies the relationship among histone modification sites on a genome-wide scale.

This method is focused on combinatorial effects of histone modifications which have a significant effect on the gene expression. To identify these histone modifications, we have to rule out other factors which could have an impact on gene expression. Gene activities in eukaryotic cells are concertedly regulated by transcription factors and chromatin structure.

Furthermore, since clusters of genes with the same histone modification patterns are enriched with coexpressed genes, the expression coherence (EC) scores are mainly contributed by transcription factors and histone modifications. As a result, if we eliminate the influence of TFs, we will gain transactions whose EC scores of their target genes are mainly attributed to same histone modification combinations. After applying this method to two distinct histone modification data, the specific modification combinations as well as global pattern of histone modification data were obtained.



II. RESULT    In this paper we propose a method to identify the combinatorial effect of histone modification by association rule mining. The technology of association rule mining can find interesting association or correlation relationships among a large set of data items. We adopted this data mining technology to explore the relationships or the synergies between these histone modifications. In short, this method first identifies functional histone combinations according to gene expression and then extracts correlation relationships or patterns among these large histone combinations by association rule mining technology.

A. Steps for the Method  Our method first identifies functional histone combinations according to gene expression and then applies association rule mining to candidate transactions. The functional histone modification combinations have two characters (1) significant EC scores (Materials and Methods in supplementary filel) (2) no significant TFs in the promoter region or significant TFs which interact with chromatin modifiers. The steps of method can be described as follows: First, we generated  3 n transactions each of which corresponds to a histone modification combination or pattern, where n is the number of sites. Second, we identified M transactions which have significant EC scores among all possible transactions. Third,  we determined N) + N 2 candidate transactions among M transactions which correspond to FMTs (Materials and Methods). Finally, we applied association rule mining  technology on the N) + N 2 candidate transactions.

Notablely, for the convenience of understanding, a flowchart of this algorithm can be found in Fig. s1. When applying aprioir-like algorithm, association rules were extracted with absolute minimum support of 5 (which correspond to 0.42% of the whole transactions for Poklok et al.'s data, 0.37% for Kurdistani et al. 's data), minimum confidence of 80% and minimum lift (improvement) of 110% (Materials and Methods). This method extracted association rules from transactions whose target genes has higher EC score and they are mainly regulated by histone modification. We applied the proposed methodology to two different histone modification data and identified a number of modification combinations some of which are supported by previous studies. And our association rules provide two different global views of histone modification landscapes on two datasets (Fig. 1, 3). These novel patterns we extracted lay a useful foundation for the additional experiments necessary to gain a fuller understanding of the roles of combinations of histone modifications in gene expression.

B. Association Rules Derived from Pokholok et al. 's Data  In this section, we illustrated the relationships obtained from Pokholok et al. 's data. We selected acetylation levels at 3 sites, H3K9, H3K14, and H4 (referring to non-specific acetylation on any of the four acetylable lysines on H4 tails), and 5 methylation levels of H3K4mel, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K36me3, and H3K79me3. The above eight histone   modification levels are measured in YPD medium. According to genome-wide distribution patterns of histone modifications [14], we selected the histone modification levels near TSS (transcription start sites) for H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H4ac, and H3k4me3, and selected the mean level of the ORF for the rest modifications(Materials and Methods). As shown in Fig. sl,  among 38 transactions, we filtered out transactions whose number of target genes is less than 20. Then we got 3052 transactions, and after being filtered by EC scores, 0.08(Materials and Methods, Fig. s2), 1674 transactions were  obtained. We obtained 552 N) transactions and 631 N2  transactions, and then we got NJ + N2 = 1183 FMTs (supplementary file2). Applying association rule mining to FMTs, we extracted 21 rules from 8 histone modification levels (Table sl).

1) Overview of the extracted rules: We can see the global view of histone modification of FMTs (Fig. 1). In Fig. 1, the higher the EC scores, the higher the histone modification level is, which confirmed the FMTs we chose were reasonable.

From the overall over-expressed state of extracted 21 rules (Fig. 2), we found that a majority of rules (61.9% ,13 of 21) includes item '63' (the modification level of H3K4me3 is over-expressed). It is consistent with the fact that hisone H3K4 methylation is a post-translational modification that is exclusively associated with actively transcribed genes [15].

There are 71 % (15 of 21) of rules each of which is consisted of any of '63' (H3K4me3), '73'(H3K36me3), or '83' (H3K79me3), and synergized with  '13' (H3K9ac),'23' (H3KI4ac),or '33'(H4ac),such as  81,13,63 => 51, 41,33,73,83 => 53 ,etc.

These results indicate that actively transcribed euchromatin has high level of acetylation and is trimethylated at H3K4, H3K36 and H3K79 [4]. There are 90% (19 of 21) of rules each of which has an over-expressed histone modification level at sites within H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H4ac, H3K4me2, and H3K4me3. Out of 13 rules which includes '63' item, there are 10 rules (account for 77%) that emerge with '13' or '23', which suggest that H3K4me3 and H3 hyperacetylation occur together [ 16]. Yet, intriguingly, there are 52% (11 of 21) of rules can be explained by the previous literature. In the following sections, we discuss the patterns extracted from Pokholok et al.'s data.

Fig. 1. The global view of histone modification of FMTs for Pokholok et al. 's data. Rows represent transactions, and columns represent sites. To obtain global view of histone modification of FMTs, we used a sliding window of 10 transactions to calculate ratio of over-expressed state of sites. The transactions were sorted according to Ee scores. The graph showed the over-expressed states of histone modification.

Over-expressed state corresponds to 'X3' and under-expressed state corresponds to 'Xl' in the extracted rules, where 'X' is the column number.

2) Cross-talk between (H3K9acIH3K14acIH4ac), H3K4me2, H3K4me3 and H3K79me3: From rulel to rule4  ([ 81,13,63 => 51], [81,13, 51 => 63 ], [81,23,51 => 63 ],  [81,33, 51 => 63 ], see Table I), we found that there was a similar pattern among them, which can be formulated as H3K9ac [+] or H3KI4ac[+] or H4ac [+], H3K4me2[-], H3K4me3[+] and H3K79 [-]. Since association rules were extracted from FMTs whose target genes have higher EC scores, the above synergic patterns are indispensable to active genes. During gene activation state, TFs at the upstream activator sites recruit positive modifiers, such as histone acetylases (HAT), at the promoter, while DNA-bound RNA polymerase recruits histone methylases at the ORF [2]. fu addition, previous studies also showed a correlation between  H3K4me3 and RNA polymerase(POL) II initiation [17].

Moreover, acetylation of H3 and H4 or di- or trimethylation (me) of H3K4 are associated with active transcription [14].

Taken together, it is reasonable that the sites of H3 or H4 acetylation and sites of H3K4 methylation coexisted in this pattern, such as H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H4ac and H3K4me2, H3K4me3.We also found interesting phenomena in above rules. First, H3K79m3 are under-expressed in the above pattern. Since little is known about the function of H3K79me3, the mechanism under this pattern is still unknown. Next we observed that the level of H3K4me3 is over-expressed while H3K4me2 is under-expressed. It is unclear, however, what reasons lead to this exclusive relationship between H3K4m2 and H3K4me3. We speculated that there may be two possibilities behind this phenomenon. First, like their roles in transcription, H3K4me2 is related with potential for gene activity, whereas H3K4me3 is related with gene activity.

Second, it is also possible that H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 are at   different methylation state [14], therefore, there are exclusive at active genes. Then we also found that H3K4me3 always was associated with H3 acetylation. The reasons are described as follows: One the one hand, because Gcn5 HAT complex stimulates H3K4me3, H3 acetylation are associated with H3K4 metylation; on the other hand, Chdl chromodomain links H3K4 methylation with H3 acetylation [16]. The above evidence highlights the interplay that can occur between acetylation of H3 or H4, H3K4me2, H3K4me3 and H3K79me3.

3) Cross-talk between (H3K4me2IH3K4me3) and (H3K9acIH3K14acIH4ac): This pattern is more universal than above pattern, there are 9 rules (rulel-4, rule9-12, rulel 5) which satisfy this pattern. fu this pattern, H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 are mutually exclusive, while H3K9ac and H3KI4ac and H4ac are exclusive with each other. As described above, both H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 are enriched at actively transcribed genes, which is supported by analyses of the different H3K4 methylation states and their distribution in various organisms [8]. Furthermore, H3K4me3 always promote H3 or H4 acetylation. Taken together, this pattern is reasonable and easy to interpret. futerestingly, this pattern is highly consistent with notable patterns of coexisting histone marks in human cells, such as 'H3K4me2/3+H4KI6ac' and 'H3K4me2/3+H3K9/14/18/23ac', which were supported by chromatin immunoprecipitatation (ChIP) and mass spectrometry (MS) method [18]. There are several similar histone modification characteristics between human cells and budding yeast, such as, association between H3K4me3 and  RNA POL II initiation, association between H3K36me3 and elongation, association between H3K4 methylation and actively transcribed genes, etc [7], [17]. Therefore, one possible interpretation is that this pattern can be applicable to human cells. Nevertheless, further experimental methods need to be done to validate this pattern.

4) Cross-talk between (H3K14acIH4ac), H3K4me2, H3K36me3 and H3K79me3: We also observed similar pattern  form rule I 6 ( 41,33,73,83 => 53 ) and rule21  ( 41,23,73, 53 => 83 ). This pattern is consistent with activation process of gene expression. During activation state, DNA-bound activator firstly recruits histone acetylases (HAT) at the promoter, whereas DNA-bound RNA POL recruits histone methylases at the ORF. Secondly, early in elongation,  phosphorylation of C-terminal domain (CTD) polymerase result in recruiting COMPASS complex, part of which (Setl) methylates H3K4. Last, later during elongation, phosphorylation of the CTD results in recruiting Set2 methyltransferase which methylates H3K36 [2].

Besides, H3K36m3 and H3K79me3 are implicated in activation of transcription, and histone H3K36 methylation mediated by Set2 is an important landmark on chromatin during elongation [4], [14]. Thus, it is reasonable in above extracted pattern. Since little is known about the function of metylation of H3K79, the exact mechanism by which    H3K36me3 cooperates with H3K79me3 remains to be determined.

C. Association Rules Derived from Kurdistani et al. 's Data In this section, we illustrated the relationships obtained  from Kurdistani et al. 's data. In this dataset there are 11 acetylation sites, including three lysines in histone H4 (K8, K12, KI6), four in histone H3 (K9, K14, K18, K23), one in H2A (K7), and two in histone H2B (Kll, KI6). Here, we utilized acetylation data for intergenic regions (Materials and  Methods). Among 311 transactions, we filtered out transactions whose number of target genes is less than 20.

Then we got 10941 transactions, and after filtered by EC scores (0.08), 2193 transactions were obtained. We obtained  594 NJ transactions and 760 N2 transactions, and then we  got NJ + N2 = 1354 FMTs (supplementary file3). Because H3K18 ( '6X') accounts for the largest proportion of transactions among FMTs and H3K18 was deemed as a general mark of active transcription (see below), we eliminated rules which contained '6X' (X=l or 3) to highlight histone modification patterns of other modification sites. We extracted 188 rules from the 1354 FMTs. After deleting rules including '6X', we obtained 69 rules. Due to space limits,  here we only presented 32 rrues (Table s2) whose supports are greater than or equal to one, the rest rules are presented in additional file 2.

1) Overview of the extracted rules: As shown in Fig. 3, we found that '63' (H3K18) is the largest abundance with the ratio of 71 % (968 of 1354 FMTs). Furthermore, H3K18 was identified as the most widely regruated acetylation site, and its acetylation appears to be a general mark of active transcription [11], [19], thus we deem that H3K18 perform its function in a global manner. On the other hand, from the overall under-expressed state of extracted 69 rules (Fig. 4, after elimination of H3KI8), we found that H4K16 accounts for the largest proportion among extracted rilles. The reason may be that the number of TFs to regulate H4K16 is the least among 11 acetylation sites, which is only 2 TFs to regulate H4K16 contrast to 15 TFs for H3K18 [19].

Because of eliminating '6X'(X= lor 3) among the extracted rules, there are no value on H3KI8 sites ('6X' site).

2) Cross-talk involving unacetylation of H4K16 and  acetylation at other sites: From Table II, we found that there was a common item (31) from a large majority of extracted rules. Therefore, the item of '31 " i.e., unacetylation of H4K16, is important for these histone modifications and plays a special role in transcription. Furthermore, the unacetylated H4K16 has an activating role in euchromatin and unacetylated H4K16 in the context of acetylation at other sites is important for transcription [5]. For example, among 32 extracted rules  (supports are greater than or equal to 1, Table s2), there are 27 rules which are consistent with role of unacetylation of H4K16 in the context of acetylation at other sites, such as, H4K8, H3K23, H3K9 and so forth.



III. DISCUSSION  In this paper, we present a new method to identify the combinatorial effects of histone modification by association rrue mining. The method is based on association rules discovery technique and can find individual functional sites as well as the combinations of them. Through the analysis of two histone modification datasets, we extracted a number of rules some of which are strongly supported by previous studies. The drawback of association rule mining is that the number of generated rules is often very large, even if minimum support and confidence are satisfied. To address this question, besides support and confidence adopted, we also adopted following methods: First, we restricted association rule with a single item in the consequent. Second, a high improvement cut-off (is larger than 110%) must be satisfied for each rille, which guarantees strong dependence between antecedent and consequent (Supplementary file2). Last, the other two measures, p-value and corrected p-value, must be satisfied.

Interestingly, there are also a few novel rules which contradict with extracted patterns. For example, rule5  (13,71,33,63 ? 51) and rille6 (13,71,23,63 ? 51) have either H3K9ac and H4ac or H3K9ac and H3K14ac in the antecedent, which contradict with the above statement that    these acetylation sites are exclusive for each other. One possible explanation could be that they are mutually exclusive in some patterns, but not in others; another possible explanation is that they are exclusive, and the contradiction is due to noise. Which statement is correct remains to be elucidated. Interestingly, there exist common modification patterns between yeast and human cells, which could guide further experimental methods to explore histone modification patterns.



IV. CONCLUSIONS  In this paper we have proposed a method for the analysis of histone modification data, which can identify the combinatorial effects of histone modifications. This approach is based on the association rules discovery technique and statistical hypothesis testing method. We applied this algorithm to two different datasets and generated many interesting rules and patterns. From Pokholok et al. 's data, we acquired 21 ru1es.

From the landscape of extracted rules, we found the dominant signal of H3Kme3, which could be supported by many literatures. Also, we extracted three typical patterns, such as, '(H3K9acIH3KI4acIH4ac) + H3K4me2 + H3K4me3 + H3K79me3', ' (H3K4me2IH3K4me3) + (H3K9acIH3KI4acIH4ac) " and '(H3KI4acIH4ac), H3K4me2+ H3K36me3 + H3K79me3', which also can be explained by previous studies. Most interestingly, our results demonstrated a very good correspondence between yeast and human cells regarding the dominant role of H3K4me3 and the pattern '(H3K4me2IH3K4me3) + (H3K9acIH3KI4acIH4ac)  , .

We also obtained several global factors from Kurdistani et al.'s data. Because over-expressed state of H3K18 occurs in large majority of rules and its acetylation appears to be a general mark of active transcription, we deem that H3K18 perform its function in a global manner. Due to the global role of H3K18, we eliminated ru1es which contained '6X' (X=1 or 3) to highlight histone modification patterns of other modification sites. After elimination of H3K18, we found synergy between unacetylation of H4K16 and acetylation at other sites, which also be supported by literatures.

Furthermore, these novel patterns we extracted lay a useful foundation for the additional experiments necessary to gain a fuller understanding of the roles of combinations of histone modifications in gene expression. More importantly, the method used here to identify the combinatorial effects of histone modifications can also be used to gain insights into relationships between histone modification sites across the genome in other higher eukaryotes.
