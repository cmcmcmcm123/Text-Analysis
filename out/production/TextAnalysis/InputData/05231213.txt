A research on the sequential pattern similarity of time series  Xun Lin1,3 Yong Zhou2  Yuan Xue1

ABSTRACT? In general?  the distance measuring method could only measure the pattern similarities of the time series with the same length. Through introducing the concept of dynamic time warping distance, this work proposed a way to define the dynamic time warping distance of the sequential patterns and finally carry out simulation experiments based on the defining the similarities of meta patterns..

KEYWORDSs: time series?sequential pattern?similarity.



I.  INTRODUCTION The time association rules are the important and valuable  information implicitly contained in the time series. This information could contribute a lot to the decision making of the time series users. The measurement of the time series? sequential pattern similarity is a vital step in extracting the time association rules from the time series.

III.  THE DYNAMIC TIME WARPING DISTANCE OF TIME  SERIES Dynamic Time Warping(ATW) was initially applied in  the fields of text data matching and visual pattern recognition .It has been already demonstrated by previous researches that the algorithms based on non-linear time warping technology could achieve high precision in both recognition and matching. Berndt and Clifford proposed that ATW can be introduced into the analysis of time series.

Good performance has already been gained in primary researches[1][2][3].

The whole metric represents the distance metrics  between two time series and each blank represents one element of the distance metrics. As illustrated by figure 1?  the path between 11a  and nma  is a warping path. In the  distance metrics of these two time series ?there?re several  warping paths from 11a  to nma  .

However ? we can always find a warping  path KwwwW ,...,, 21= , to minimize ?  =  K  i iw  1  This path  KwwwW ,...,, 21=   is defined as the optimal warping path for the distant metrics [4][5][6]?we call this minimum value as the dynamic warping distance between time series  X  and which is denoted as  ),( YXDdtw , then we have?  },...,,,min{),( 21  K  K  i idtw wwwWwYXD == ?  = The dynamic warping distance two time series  ),( YXDdtw  has the following features?

We?ve only given the dynamic time warping distant but didn?t provide the way of solving it above. Exhaustive search algorithms are a possible way, but it turned out to be not practical when the pattern series is very long. The time cost is also extremely high since there might be many warping paths and they?re in a exponential relationship with  the elements in the distance metrics. If point ij a  is in the  optimal warping path, then the sub path from point 11a   to  point ij a  is also a local optimal solution from which we can  deduce that the optimal path from 11a  to  nma  can be gained through searching the local optimal solution from  11a  to NMa  in an iterative way:  ? ? ?  ????+= =  )},1(),1,(),1,1(min{),( )1,1( 11  jisjisjisajis as  ij (2.1) ni ,...,3,2= ? mj ,...,3,2= .In the distance metrics  ? the minimum accumulated value in the warping path  is ),( nms  Then, we can get the optimal path by regressing  from ij a  to the beginning point )1,1(s  according to the minimum accumulative values in the warping path [7][8]?  and compute the dynamic warping distance ),( YXDdtw  of these two pattern series.

IV. THE DYNAMIC TIME WARPING ALGORITHM FOR SEQUENTIAL PATTERN SIMILARITIES  We can only compute the distance between two series with equal length no matter using the meta pattern monotonous or vector distance of the sequential pattern or using the weighting pattern distance [11]?Dynamic time warding distance method can be applied in computing the distance between two points with different dimensions?this idea can be introduced in computing the distance between series with different length.

The dynamic time warping distance of the pattern series  can be used to compute the distant of time series with random length. Because the dynamic time distance of the pattern series has the features of positive, symmetry, and triangle inequation ? so it can be used to define the similarity of two pattern series.

V. SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS We use all data from Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 index  in both the year of 2006 and 2007 as our experimental objects?like illustrated by figure 2and figure 3.They?re converted into pattern series and contain 80 and 88 meta patterns respectively. Their distance is computed as 28.4 using pattern series dynamic time warping distance methods. Therefore the pattern series of these two time series are not quite similar. This is because that in 2006, the                         Shanghai and Shenzhen index increased tardily. However  in the 2007?nearly all stockers entered the market which promoted the rapid increase in the Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 index and therefore resulted the great difference between 2006 and 2007.
