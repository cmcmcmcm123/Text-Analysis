Curating and mining (big) data

Abstract  According to the wide development of the World Wide Web world, many peoples have tend to mention ?big data? and tried to make use of the ?big data.? They usually mention ?big data? as a key to the happy future. However, it will be a dream which will not be realized. In this paper, I review problems in big data. Then I propose a concept of curation to deal with such big and complex data.



I. Introduction  According to the wide development of the World Wide Web world, many peoples have tend to mention ?big data? and tried to make use of the ?big data.? They usually mention ?big data? as a key to the happy future. Thus in Japan, usually magazines or books show very positive aspects of big data. Of course some magazines such as Weekly Toyo Keizai (2013.4.20) also pointed out the negative aspect of big data. That is, big data usually contain harmful data (noise). In addition, if data become too big, it becomes rather difficult to comprehend whole data. If we simply analyze the data, we will only be able to obtain poor results which are useless or harmful.

In [23] Silver shows both aspects of big data and illustrates actual results from both aspects. Especially he claims the importance of distinguishing a true signal from a universe of noisy, ever-increasing data. For instance, for the forecasting the electoral politics, he points out ?Fox- like attitudes may be especially important when it comes to making predictions about politics.? Fox?s strategy is to believe in a plethora of little ideas and in taking a multitude of approaches toward a problem. They tend to be more tolerant of nuance, uncertainty, complexity, and dissenting opinion. On the other hand, hedgehogs who have a lot of information construct stories ? stories that are neater and tidier than the real world. When we construct these stories, we can lose the ability to think about the evidence  critically. From the viewpoint of Silver, for the larger information, it is necessary to divide it to small pieces and consider nuance, uncertainty, complexity, and dissenting situation of the information.

For big data, Fung [13] pointed out ?numbersense begins with looking at the data. Keep your hands off, though, until you have dug out excruciating details of how the data is collected. [...] raw, untampered-with data almost never yields the answer. Some form of adjustments ? whether it?s seasonality, or bias correction, or others ?are like the dressing on top of a salad.? The most important point is that to understand how the data is collected. That is, if we do not consider the origin or source of data, we sometimes analyze the data wrongly. Thus a strategy to review the feature of data is very important.

In fact, the similar problems were discussed before the ?big data? age. In this paper, I introduce a concept of curation to deal with ?big data.? First, I illustrate the medical data as complex data. Then I show the importance of interface between users and data. For that curation is adopted to achieve the better interface system. In addition, I illustrate how curation functions in the context of the data market proposed by Ohsawa [19].



II. From small data to big data  A. Data collection  We proposed a framework called Cyber Integrated Medical Infrastructure (CIMI) which is a framework of integrated management of clinical data on computer net- works consisting of a database, a knowledge base, and an inference and learning component, which are connected to each other in the network [2]. In this framework, medical information (e.g. clinical data) is analyzed or data mined to build a knowledge base for predicting all possible diseases and to support medical diagnosis. As shown below, more than 130 items are included in the medical data of each person. Item sets in the data are, for instance,   DOI 10.1109/ICDMW.2013.51    DOI 10.1109/ICDMW.2013.51     ?2-microglobulin (serum), SCC antigen, ?-seminoprotein, TPA, TK activity, NSE, Ferritin, BFP (serum), Total protein, albumin, ?-GTP, ZTT, serum protein fraction- ?1-globulin, ALP Triglyceride, LDL Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol, urine sugar, HbA1c, White blood cell count, Platelet, Cl, Cell immunity T Cell number, and ACP.

Usually such type of data are collected during medial treatments. However, such collected data usually lack sev- eral items. Because physicians tend to omit unnecessary or expensive data. For instance, if they do not think a patient has any problem in lung, they do not ask to collect data regarding lung. Accordingly, the collected data do not in- clude such data. In Abe04a, we tried to supplement lacking data by adding newly and computationally generated data.

However, such data will not be the same as actual data. For the treatment we assumed that the data distribution would follow the standard distribution. Accordingly the generated data will follow our estimated pattern. In addition, it will be difficult to collect large size of data only during medical treatment. Therefore, we decided to collected the complete clinical data as an experiment. In the project, we have intently collected more than 2200 medical data sets. From certain persons, the data were collected more than once.

Actually we could collect complete clinical data, but the distribution of age is shown in Fig. 1. The ratio of persons in their 50?s is very high which might become the reason for the different distribution of health levels1.

Currently, we collect data from office workers (aged 40 to 50 years old) but not from students or younger persons.

Thus the age distribution pattern is not similar to the Japanese standard age distribution pattern. This is because we did not collect samples from persons belonging to all types of person but only from those who applied to take part in our experiments. Most of our subjects are old office workers in rather high position and live in or close to Tokyo. Therefore, our results might not reflect social tendencies.

Fig. 1. Distribution of age (Clinical data)  Actually we can collect large size of clinical data by  1Health levels that express the health status of patients are defined based on Tumor stage [16] and modified by Matsuoka.

the experiment. In addition to the above problem we still have more serious problem.

B. Data treatment  We have generated the health level determination model by applying C4.5 [20] to the collected data. For the accuracy ratio of the health level determination, with the model generated by around 2000 samples, 44.3 % of health level can be correctly determined. In fact, for health level 3, it is rather difficult to correctly determine the health level. Since the data distribution is not balanced as well as does not follow standard data distribution, we do not have sufficient number of example in health level 3 to build a proper model. Even if we can collect a large sized data set, if it is heterogeneous, it is still difficult to conduct a proper data analysis. In addition, the structure of the data is complex, it is rather difficult to conduct a proper data analysis. In fact, our data set includes many items (more than 130). Accordingly it is rather difficult to deal with the data 2. Because in the data set, data from various type of client are included. For instance, those who have Diabetes Mellitus and those who have Helicobacter pylori are included. For each case, the feature of medical data should be different. Accordingly, in order to explain various situations, the generated decision tree becomes very complex, that is, it has many leaves.

During medical treatment physicians usually focus on necessary data for their diagnosis. However, computers cannot perform such a selective analysis. They can deal with all data equally. Accordingly analyzed data sometimes represent the different aspect of the data. Therefore, it will be necessary to provide a strategy to achieve a selective analysis or help such analysis.

In addition, it is necessary to discover relationships of data, which can suggest the removal of unnecessary links and can aid the recovery or supplement of missing rules or links that lead to the determination of the correct health levels. Several relationships that could improve the accuracy in determining health levels could be discovered.

C. Data visualization  For the better analysis of data, intuitively introduction of data visualization can be considered. In [5] and [8], I introduced a system called an Interface for medical diagnosis support.

During the procedure shown in Fig. 2, the user can review a certain patient whose health status is estimated as 5a3. In the right window of the right browser, the user  2It is sometimes called as the curse of dimensionality.

3In [5], I described health status as health level. For the definition of  health level, please refer to [5] etc.

Fig. 2. Interactive interface for medical diag- nosis support.

can check the selected data to confirm if the patient is in the health status of 5a. Similarly, the user can view all the estimated health status at a glance and check doubtful or uncertain patient?s data. Thus the proposed system offers a flexible interface to conduct medical diagnosis and data compilation. Beside, the most important point of the proposed system is that all windows (interfaces) are automatically generated according to the data set and the analyzed results.

By using the interactive interface, the user can discover hidden or potential and important factor of patient. From this viewpoint, we can say this application is chance discovery application. In addition, we can say it can offer curatorial situation. Detailed discussions will appear in the following sections.



III. Curation  This section reviews various types of curation. Actually curatorial task is usually used for tasks in (art) museum.

Many cases introduced in this section are curatorial works in gallery and (art) museum. In addition a new type of curation, -digital data curation, is also reviewed.

A. (General) curation  There is at least a person who is responsible as ?cu- rator? in (special) exhibitions, galleries, archive, or (art) museums. Their main task of curator is a curatorial task, which is multifaceted. Curator comes from a Latin word ?cura? which means cure. Then originally it used for a person who take care of a cultural heritage.

In the report by American Association of Museums Curators Committee (AAMCC) [12], they pointed out ?curators are highly knowledgeable, experienced, or ed- ucated in a discipline relevant to the museum?s purpose or  mission. Curatorial roles and responsibilities vary widely within the museum community and within the museum itself, and may also be fulfilled by staff members with other titles.? Then they showed the definition of curator as follows;  ? Remain current in the scholarly developments within their field(s); conduct original research and develop new scholarship that contributes to the advancement of the body of knowledge within their field(s) and within the museum profession as a whole.

? Make recommendations for acquiring and deac- cessioning objects in the museum collection.

? Assume responsibility for the overall care and development of the collection, which may include artifacts, fine art, specimens, historic structures, and intellectual property.

? Advocate for and participate in the formulation of institutional policies and procedures for the care of the collection that are based on accepted profes- sional standards and best practices as defined by AAM, CurCom, and other relevant professional organizations.

? Perform research to identify materials in the col- lection and to document their history.

? Interpret the objects belonging or loaned to the museum.

? Develop and organize exhibitions.

? Contribute to programs and educational materials.

? Advocate and provide for public use of the col-  lection.

? Develop or contribute to monographs, essays,  research papers, and other products of original thought.

? Represent their institution in the media, at public gatherings, and at professional conferences and seminars.

? Remain current on all state, national, and inter- national laws as they pertain to objects in the museum collection.

In addition, AAMCC showed curatorial responsibilities as follows;  A. Research, Scholarship, and Integrity B. Interpretation C. Acquisition, Care, and Disposal D. Collection Access and Use E. Replication of Objects in the Collection  Thus curators have responsibilities for various aspects of exhibition activities. However, the most important ac- tivity will be a plan of exhibition. For that the above activities such as research, interpretation and acquisition are necessary. They should properly exhibit a truth which is result of their researches and interpretations.

B. e-Science Data Curation  The above curation is for actual museums. That is, curation is conducted mainly for actual works. However, curation in this section is for digital data. There are several differences between digital curation and analogue curation.

JISC pointed out an importance of curation as ?pro- moting good curation and an information infrastructure to capitalise upon and preserve expensively gathered data means bringing together varied technical and managerial resources, and managing these over time. This activity needs to be supported by clear strategies for resourcing and support [14].?  They compare curation with archiving and preservation.

? Curation: The activity of managing and promoting the use of data from its point of creation, to ensure it is fit for contemporary purpose, and available for discovery and re-use. For dynamic datasets this may mean continuous enrichment or updating to keep it fit for purpose.

? Archiving: A curation activity which ensures that data is properly selected, stored, can be accessed and that its logical and physical integrity is main- tained over time, including security and authentic- ity.

? Preservation: An archiving activity in which spe- cific items of data are maintained over time so that they can still be accessed and understood through successive change and obsolescence of technologies.

That is, they pointed out that curation is more creative task. Then they showed aspects of curation as follows:  ? Trust: Trust can be enhanced by the existence of qualified domain specialists who curate the data.

? Utility: Certain information about the data ? where it came from, how it was generated, for example? is necessary to enable future users to gauge the utility and reliability of the data, and indeed any annotation of the data. Data utility also depends on the ability of users to manage and analyse it; data mining tools and algorithms, visualisation tools, user interfaces and portals will play a crucial role in accelerating research.

? Discoverability: How will future users find data, in particular data they do not know exists, in other domains, or archived according to terminology which has fallen out of use? Data access is often organised through portals; how will those portals be organised? What tools will users need to read or use the data, and who will provide these tools?

? Access management: A significant proportion of data involves confidentiality issues. Ownership and rights management also need to be taken into account.

? Heterogeneity: Not only is this data revolution creating a deluge of data, the data itself comes in very many different and often specialist formats, some created by the researchers themselves.

? Complexity: The data can be composite in nature, with links to external objects and external depen- dencies (such as calibration information), and be highly complex in structure. This complexity rep- resents a significant challenge for the preservation of data.

They use ?data curation? because they think data have value. Not only for keeping data but also usability of data for the public, they use the word ?curation.? Actually, most of data are neither art works nor archaeological artifacts. However, is is important to view data from the aspect of what should be preserved. The main difference between data and art works or archaeological artifacts is that data do not have a shape and cannot exist alone.

It is necessary to prepare a container such as a cdrom and a hard disc drive system. Therefore for data curation, ?Discoverability? plays a significant role.

The aim of the data curation seems to have the similar objective as data jacket [18].

C. Curation in business and information market  In 2011, several books on curation were published. In Japan we had at least two publications which I noticed by Katsumi [15] and Sasaki [22]. In addition, Rosenbaum published ?Curation Nation? [21] in the same year. They discuss a ?curation? in ?business? and information market field.

As an example, I review ?curation? by Sasaki.

Sasaki defined curation in [22] as follows:  Curation: From huge amount of information source, ac- cording to the curator?s sense of value and world view, picking up information, giving a new meaning to it and sharing it with many persons.

Sasaki used a metaphor of biotope4 to illustrate the promotion of a unknown or less known but a good artist.

His main point to successful promotion is to recognize:  ? Where those who need a certain information live?

? How to offer the information to those who need  the information?

? How to make them impressed by the information?

4Biotope is an area of uniform environmental conditions providing a  living place for a specific assemblage of plants and animals. Biotope is almost synonymous with the term habitat, but while the subject of a habitat is a species or a population, the subject of a biotope is a biological community. (from Wikipedia)     He gave a metaphor the place where those who need a certain information live as a biotope. Actually strategies he illustrated are very intentional because they are business that should be successful and that were succeeded. In addi- tion, he pointed out the importance of a human as a media.

That is in order to generate sympathies, there should be a certain context and the context will be generated (aware) not only by a viewpoint such as search keyword, place and program but also by the specialized person?s sense of value and world view. His viewpoint is based on Social Network System (SNS), then his curation can be regarded as a generation of explicit, multi-core circle type, and indefinite relationship supported by social media.

Curation in business?: A ?curation? for business in the internet age seems an interaction between customer (user) and goods. There will not be a system to insist on trends from big companies, but trends will be constructed or selected according to customers? interaction on (in- ter)networks. In addition, a (small) company or community can use this system to give rare goods a certain trend.

Thus the strategy of information delivery in business has changed in recent year and they call this type of information delivery as ?curation.? Curation in business means not only an information display system but also an information delivery strategy. If we interpret this type of curation as interaction between users and data, this type of curation should be considered during dealing with big data.



IV. Complex data and curation  A. Curation in chance discovery  In [7], I proposed and defined a concept of curation in chance discovery5.

Though in various articles, the definition of a ?chance? is described which was introduced by Ohsawa [17], I wish to introduce it here again. In fact, it rather differs from the original definition in [17] to reflect the recent research interests.

A chance is rare, hidden, potential or novel event(s) / situation(s) that can be conceived either as a future opportunity or risk.

Then ?chance discovery? research is a type of research to establish methods, strategies, theories, and even activi- ties to discover a chance. In addition, it aims at discovering human factors for chance discoveries.

Accordingly a definition of curation in chance discovery is:  5In [9] and [10], I extended the definition of curation in chance discovery, which introduced a concept of holistic communication [11].

In this paper, I used the extended version of curation.

? Curation is a task to offer users opportunities to discover chances.

? Curation should be conducted with considering to offer implicit and potential possibilities.

? Chances should not be explicitly displayed to users.

? However, such chances should rather easily be discovered and arranged according to the user?s interests and situations. This can be achieved for instance by affordance.

? There can be a certain holistic communication environment. This type of holistic communication might function as media to discover chance for novice users.

? There should be a certain freedom for user to in- terpret a key person, matter, thing or event, which should only stimulate or assist users? thinking procedure.

? There should be a certain freedom for user to arrange chances.

The main point of curation is how to display data to users and how not to insist on any interpretation to users. But critical point to understand the data should be presented. Accordingly, users can rather easily deal with data and can interpret data flexibly, freely and properly.

B. Application as curation  In the previous section, I illustrated the interactive interface for medical treatment. Actually it was developed for the purpose of a diagnosis support for physicians.

In addition it was developed by the concept of chance discovery. That is, it designed to provide an opportunity to discover hidden or potential and important factor of patient. Therefore, it provide both the original data and the analyzed result. The original data and the analyzed result are linked via HTML-based browsers. The interface is automatically generated from clinical data. At first, as a result of C4.5 analysis, Fig. 3 is generated. This browser provides very simple information. If we click the ID shown in the lest window, the analyzed decision tree is shown in the right window.

If we click link anchors on leaves of the decision tree, another (second) browser will be coming up that has more detailed information on health level (Fig. 4). In this browser, we can check the standard range of each items relating to the health level. For instance, the range of TK Activity should be less than 5.0. The standard value is obtained by referring to the data library of Mitsubishi Chemical Medience Corporation (http://www.medience.co.

jp/). Only items included in the clicked line are shown.

Fig. 3. Interactive interface for medical diag- nosis support (1st).

Fig. 4. Interactive interface of medical data analysis: Subjects list on a leaf of the decision tree is shown.

By clicking at the ID in the second browser, the third browser is obtained as shown in Fig.5, which presents the medical data for that ID. In the browser, the abnormally high values can be found as described in red and abnor- mally low values as described in blue. For instance, in this case, Apolipoprotein A-I is 192.0, Apolipoprotein B is 107.0, and blood sugar is 120. That means that he/she may suffer from rather serious Lipid metabolism abnormalities or Arteriosclerosis. In fact, with the proposed interface, it is rather easy to focus on such abnormal data.

Thus we can review results by C4.5 in the organic view and we can check each value relating to certain health levels in detail.

Of course, an intelligent data base can perform such compilation of data. However, one of the important feature  Fig. 5. Part of a third browser.

is the interface links data and analyzed data. In the case, the analysis is performed by C4.5.

In [8], I pointed out as follows:  ? Even if health levels are differently recorded, when the subjects health levels are properly de- termined, it is easy to correct them. The reason for this is that differently recorded health levels are displayed in red colour and therefore the link can be followed to check the original data and to confirm if their health levels are correct or not.

? Exceptional (abnormal or normal) factors and the missing rules can be discovered with an interactive interface. For instance, necessary rules which are not considered during health level determination can be discovered by focusing on values that are abnormal for their health levels. As shown above, it is easy to detect abnormal values by their colour.

For the same reason, it is not difficult to discover exceptions, because exceptions usually contain abnormal data for their health levels.

? Without the proposed interface, it is rather difficult to focus on necessary and meaningful data sets, because more than 100 items are contained in each individual data set and more than 2500 data have been collected. By using the interface, it is easy to determine which data should be checked.

Thus this type of interface can be considered as cura- tion. Because the interface only displays user-friendly view of a computationally analyzed result and allows flexible interpretations. In addition, as suggested above, it can also be functioned as an intelligent data base. Perhaps this is also a sort of data curation.

Accordingly one of problems in big data analysis ? how to distinguish noise from data? can be solved by this type of curation.

C. Curation and Data Jacket  In [19], Ohsawa pointed out to characterize a data jacket as follows:  In these stores6, we often find a poster saying ?this shelf has only the jacket; for the content  6shopping stores of movie DVDs and music CDs     please go ahead to buy at the register.? This trend implies that information more abstract (of less details) than a certain level can be shown open to the public, whereas the rest in details tends to be hidden. This idea is quite useful when we consider to create a social environment where data are accessible from those who seek, and where each dataset or database can be valued, or priced commercially, reasonably. [...] In contrast to what are called big data in the business context, which are hard for small firms to collect or manage, the entry of a single participant into his/her Facebook wall may be evaluated as of a priceless value if the feature of the content is sufficiently appealed via the statement on the jacket about the wall.

A data jacket functions as an index or an introduction of (big) data. It will not describe all information of the data. Thus users should guess the importance of the data by reviewing the description of the data jacket. For the better description of data jacket, it will better to introduce the concept of curation, especially chance discovery-based curation. For instance, an example shown in the above will suggest the formalization of a description format of data jacket. That is, during generating a data jacket, the data can be compiled to show their structure. In addition, each data can be linked to the structure. Then the user can understand the importance and the feature of the data.

In addition, the user can distinguish noise from data. Of course, the concept of data generator or collector should not represented in the description. The interface should allow the user?s free thinking and selection of the data. In the sense, data jacket will have a certain interactive feature where the user can check the data from various aspects. In the above, I adopt C4.5 for the data analysis. The interface is general, so any analysis (data mining) tool can be applied to data analysis. The style of the interface can be designed according to the data type and the application. I used the HTML-based interface. I think it will be better to use a portable interface. Because the user can use in various situations and OSs.

Thus the procedure of data analysis can become (the circulation of) the followings:  data collection (data cleaning) data analysis interface (data jacket) generation data interpretation (data cleaning)  Then it will be possible to deal with data very flexibly and use the data in an organic way. We can deal with the data according to the proper perspective and even we can change our perspective to the data.



V. Conclusions  In this paper, I reviewed curation based on chance discovery and showed an interactive interface for medical diagnosis as an application of the curation. Then I intro- duced the concept of curation to the data jacket generation.

Perhaps part of problems in dealing with big data will be:  ? How to implicitly lead user to the point which should be considered?

? How to distinguish noise from data?

? How not to insist on a fixed interpretation to the  users?

Actually these problems are not specialized to the big data mining. They are pointed out before the big data age, especially in the school of chance discovery. In fact, I pointed out these problems and proposed the concept of curation based on chance discovery. In this paper, I discuss the curation under the context of the big data mining. Data jacket is an important scheme for the description of data.

Users can guess or consider the usage of the data via the description of data jacket. However, the description should not insist users on a fixed interpretation of data and their usage. User can freely interpret and use the data, and combine several data to make them better. In addition, user can distinguish noise from data. The bigger data become, the more data contain noise.

In this paper I showed that, by the introduction of automatic generation of interactive interface from data, it is possible to provide a curated situation and it can be used as an interactive data jacket during checking and utilizing the data. The format of data jacket may not be the same as that proposed by Ohsawa. But an interactive data jacket will be one of the solution to deal with big data. By the interactive data jacket a curatorial situation can be offered to the user, then he/she can use the data in the best way. Since the curation is based on chance discovery, the performance can become the style of chance discovery where the user can be aware of chances and make use of them.

In this paper, I did not discuss the knowledge level of users. A strategy of data treatment will depend upon user?s knowledge level. It will be necessary to change the curation type according to user?s knowledge level. In the definition of curation I mentioned  ? There can be a certain holistic communication environment. This type of holistic communication might function as media to discover chance for novice users.

Thus a holistic communication can be changed accord- ing to the user?s knowledge level.
