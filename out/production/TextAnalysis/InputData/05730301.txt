A Proposal to Enhance Cross-marketing via Social

Abstract--The ability to create groups has for long been one of  the features of interest for the users across the social networks.

Groups allow users (account holders) to join them, be a fan-  follower of them, etc. In addition, there have been provisions for  the account holder to also be a part of multiple groups as a  member. The primary goal of our research is to analyze patterns  within group membership. Essentially, we will be proposing a  model based on market basket analysis over a subset of the social  network groups and then derive a set of associative mining rules  amongst these networks. The information mined may provide  interesting insights for cross-marketing purposes. For instance,  using this technique an organization Ox could find that the  buyers of their product x tend to be socially fans or members of  groups with the subtype Y or even, perhaps, more specifically  with another organization Oy that sell a product y. Using such  data, the organizations may then try to leverage these findings to  build a co-opetative (Co-operation + Competition), profitable  synergy and might also give them insights to determine which  products of Oy may be impacted if the store discontinues selling  the product x or vice-versa. The aim of this paper is to bring in a  new high-level dimension to the social network analysis area by  imbibing the concepts of Market Basket and then try to provide a  basic feasibility criterion for the entire approach by simple  simulations.

I. INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK  In the recent past, social networks and Social Network  Analysis (SNA) have been deemed as some of the most critical  components of computer supported social interactions, serving  the business analysts and strategist with a whole new method  of capturing customer mindset, market trends, etc. Content  generated in social networking environments would include  discussion threads across social network groups, micro-blog  sharing, social status messages, and any other content posted by users. This accumulated content can be considered as an  asset that has value, which can be tapped through the right  types of analyses. This asset has potential value to both owners  of the sites as well as the organizations whose products and  services are being discussed. It presents significant  implications for enterprises wanting to leverage social  networks to draw insights and inferences on user participation  and preferences expressed in networks.

While the SNA trends are creating ripples in the technological front and Web 2.0 arena, there has been quite a  wide spread interest in it from the management front as well. It  shows considerable promise for helping analysts to handle a  number of classic situations like understanding the myriad  relationships that can either facilitate or impede information  transmission, diffusion and propagation as explained by  Blondel et al in [3] through the analysis of a social network  diagram?a map of individuals and the social ties that link  them together. Apart from this, it would also help them to  come up with answers to some strategic questions like - How is  the information about a particular product/gadget, etc that was developed or manufactured by the organization flowing and  propagating outside of the organization? What are the kinds of  sentiments that are being showered upon this product? [5] Is  there an individual within this social graph who could help the  organization in propagating the news about this product? [5]  Are there some subgroups that are not sharing what they know  as effectively as they should?

In this paper, our key research hovers over modeling the use  of aspects like Market-Basket Analysis [2] by clubbing it with  Social Network Groups to build association rules and rule  metrics to extract a tripartite relationship between products,  organizations and individuals and in parallel, extract a set of associative mining rules from them.



II. PROPOSED  MODEL  The primary objective of the proposed model is to analyze  patterns within group membership. Essentially, we propose to  perform a market basket analysis on a subset of social  networks? groups. For the purpose of analysis, the ?transaction  table? is to be defined as a single transaction per person, with  the ?items? being the groups to which that person belongs.

With this in mind, let us now define some basic definitions  and notations involved in the model.

A. Formal Model  Definition 1: A Social Network Group is a database of  pages connected by elementary links that provide a single non-  decomposable content of a group in the form of group-pages.

These group-pages aren?t run by individuals, so they don?t  have a user status and don?t send updates to other users? feeds.

Instead, they import streams of related, public content from  user status messages.

We now revamp this entire notion of group-pages, groups  and links into a graph based model as follows.

Bharath C  International Institute of Information Technology  Bangalore, India  bharath.c@iiitb.net      Jai Ganesh  SETLabs, Infosys Technologies,  Bangalore, India  jai_ganesh01@infosys.com  Administrator Typewritten Text      Definition 2: We have a directed graph G = (N, E) that  consists of a set of nodes, N, which can be of two types ?  either a group or a user and E, is the set of edges or arcs. A  node Ku ? N is an entity that corresponds to a group-page K of the user u (u could also be interchangeably addressed as a  user-page). An arc is an ordered pair (?u, ?v) ? E and it corresponds to a link and the element ?, ? refers to a group- page and u, v refers to user-pages. In this case u and v can be  identical or can be different. In addition the graph is weighted  and the weight of an edge expresses the number of users that  have established a link including the one under consideration,  that are associated with a given group and moreover, the graph  G need not necessarily be connected.

Now, to capture the user preference among the groups we  introduce the concept of an association rule, which could be  of the form Xx ? Yx with a certain probability ??? (x). This probability is called as the confidence of the association rule  and is read as the probability of a user x who is associated with  a group X to also be associated with a group Y.

Definition 3: A Market Basket association rule between a  user and a group is an expression of the form Xx ? Yx , where X, Y ? N which form an ordered pair (Xu, Yu) ? E  ?u,v with a confidence ??? . This confidence represents the probability that a user would be a part of a group Y given that he or she is  already a member of group X. (.i.e with X as the source and Y  as the destination. It would be good to note that ??? ? ???  ).

Mathematically, if  |(?, ?)| denotes the number of users  who are a member of group X and Y, with X as the source and  ? ?  ? ,? ??}|(?, ?)|  represents the number of users who are a  member of group X and any other group other than group Y.

Then, the confidence CXY between X and Y is given by the  equation  ??? = |(X,Y)|  ? ?  ? ,? ??}|(? ,?)| .

Definition 4: Now that we have defined the notion and  concept of confidence between the groups, we introduce the  concept of the relevance of these confidences. Basically, the  motivation behind introducing this is to validate the level of  confidence, and because of the fact that a rule that holds a  respectable degree of interest, if and only if, the corresponding  link is traversed a significant number of times relative to the  average. This is called the support of the association rule.

Now, we define that a support of the an association rule  (? ? ?) is ??? , if and only if ???  is the number of times the groups X and Y were associated  directly through a link, over  the average of times all the links in the graph were traversed.

Thus,  ??? = |(X,Y)|   ? ?  ?? , ??+1 ??}  ? ,?  |? |  where, |E| is the number of  arcs in E. The value of ???  usually ranges around 1 and if the value of  ??? > 1, it implies that the support for the association-rule is greater than the average and vice-versa.

B. Methods for Mining Association Rules  While the previous sections described the motivation behind  using the Market Basket Analysis kind of a concept over the  social network groups, this section concentrates on the  different types of methods that are available to apply  association analysis to data.

i. Algorithms for Social Network Market Basket Analysis  In the recent past, powerful search engines have been  developed to aid in locating unfamiliar documents by  category, contents or subject. It is still not feasible to extract in  full, the meaning of an HTML document. However, more  recently, intelligent software agents have been developed  which extract semantic features from the words or structure of  an HTML document. These extracted features are then  employed to classify and categorize the documents.

On the other hand, we are not concentrating in obtaining the  entire semantics of the HTML data, but, concentrating more  on mere classification and categorization of the documents.

There are a number of methods and techniques that are  proposed in this space of social network classification like the  ones in [7, 8]. The general tendency and research pattern  amongst them has been that the technique of clustering has  been provably the simpler and more intuitive method,  especially for grouping over social networks.

The results of such a clustering mechanism could then be  used to automatically formulate queries and search for other  similar profiles that imitate a particular class of profiles,  which is exactly what is required for execution of a Market  Basket Analysis kind of a scenario.

More intuitively, we could see that for an analysis like  Market Basket, our key areas of concentration are on grouping  based on a binary matrix (as explained earlier). Thus, the key  parameters for clustering would be more towards using the  notion of ?Yes-Yes?, ?Yes-No?, ?No-Yes? and ?No-No? kind  of value groupings to form the clusters.

So essentially, from a high level perspective ? to perform a  Market Basket Analysis, we must satisfy the following  requirements. We also explain how we plan to satisfy this  requirement in our paper.

(a) First requirement is an approach for analyzing market basket data, the discovery and interpretation of  association rules [2].

In this paper, we perform the association mining and  build the association rules using the a priori algorithm  that is described in detail by Agarwal et al in [1].

(b) The second requirement is to combat the explosion of  uninteresting rules. That means we need to calculate  interestingness measures [9] on the rules. These  measures can then be used to either rank the rules by  importance (or present a sorted list to the user) or as an  additional pruning criterion. How exactly interestingness is determined varies by measure, but many existing  measures take the approach that interestingness is  ?deviation from independence.?  For this we use the existing and provably good methods  involving the calculation of measures like confidence,  support and interestingness as explained in the earlier  sections.

(c) Thirdly, we need to devise a mechanism to organize  observed data into meaningful structures, that is, to  develop taxonomies.  In other words we need to conduct  cluster analysis to sort objects into groups in a way that      the degree of association between two objects is maximal  if they belong to the same group and minimal otherwise.

For this we use the density based clustering mechanisms,  commonly known as DBSCAN that has been explained  in detail by Sander et al in [10].

(d) Finally, we need to analyze the different patterns within the clusters from a macro scale and build inferences  from them.

The patterns might include analyses like identifying the  most influential nodes of a category type X which are a  part of a cluster K which could play a crucial role in  maximizing the information diffusion and spread across  the cluster elements, which would be typically a user  profile. We use tools like Weka  [www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/] and Rapid Miner  [rapid-i.com/] for this task.



III. SIMULATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS  A. Test bed and Data set Information.

The test bed for the simulations and experiments consisted of  a large data set of 19,359 transactions or users bearing  UserIDs and each userID in-turn have a number of itemsets  (13 to be precise). In this study we used data from Facebook  [www.facebook.com].  The data was collected from a sample representative of the user population (slightly over-sampling  younger age groups to reflect the active audience).

The structure of the dataset was scraped from Facebook  using the facebook-java-api and comprises a set of users,  their social graph information in terms of their unique ID, as  well as information about the group that they belong to,  spanning over a set of major group types like Business,  Entertainment, Internet & Technology, Music, Organizations,  Sports and Student.

We then adopt an alternative, empirical approach to  determine the inter-relationships between the users? social  pursuits and employ Market Basket Analysis over this data.

This allows us to identify the inter-relationships between the  people who are interested in Business, Entertainment, Internet  & Technology, Music, Organizations, Sports and Student from  the Facebook social network.

To ease interpretation, we decided to model the results based  on a kind of conditional independence graphs. A conditional  independence graph is one in which we have four possible  clusters each representing the Yes-Yes, Yes-No, No-Yes and  No-No clusters as shown in the Figure 1. The figure shows the clusters for a few key associations in a two dimensional  format between Business and Internet & Technologies. The  Yes-Yes cluster indicates the cluster of users whose interest  lies in Business and Internet Technologies, the cluster Yes-No  indicates the cluster of users who are interested in Business  but not in Internet Technologies, similarly No-Yes and No-No  clusters also indicate the respective user preferences.

B. Experiments and Data Analytics The experiments and data analytics were conducted on the  data sets that were mentioned above. The entire analysis was  conducted to verify the proposed model and lay down a good platform for future research. As a simple proof of concept we  have proposed a simple simulation that was conducted using  Weka data mining tool using the DBSCAN cluster algorithm  and the a priori associative mining algorithm which were pre-  built in Weka.

The results of the clusters are as shown in the graphs below-  Figures 1 and 2 depict a two dimensional analysis, where as  Figure 3 depicts a three dimensional analysis of data. The  explanations of the figures and the derived inferences are  provided below the respective figures.

Fig 1 shows a 2 dimensional correlation across a Yes-Yes,  Yes-No, No-Yes and No-No clusters. The annotations in the  figure depict the state each cluster denotes. It was observed  that the Yes-Yes cluster had the smallest support and the No-  No had the largest support.

Fig 1: A 2D Cluster Analysis of Internet v/s Business    From this we could infer that if an individual is  concentrating in leveraging his/her business that is internet  viral based, then probably the number of potential influencers  or information propagators (the one?s in the Yes-Yes cluster) is  extremely less when compared to information receivers (The  ones in the Yes-No, No-Yes and No-No clusters) or if we are  looking at figure 2, which deals with the Organization versus  Business clustering we could see that the support and  confidence of the Yes-Yes association is moderate and greater  than the support and confidence of Yes-No and No-No clusters.

From this we could infer that if an individual is  concentrating in leveraging his/her Organizational Business,  then probably the number of potential influencers or  information propagators (the one?s in the Yes-Yes cluster) is  not very less when compared to information receivers (The  ones in the Yes-No, No-Yes and No-No clusters).

Fig 2: A 2D Cluster Analysis of Organization v/s  Business    Till now we have been observing and analyzing the clusters      in a purely 2 dimensional perspective viz. in a 2 parameter  world of Market Basket Analysis. However, people like Tang  et al in [11] have shown that we tend to get a better  perspective when the social world is viewed as a triadic  component than just a bi-partite component.

So, the next model of analysis shows us the possibility of  dealing and deriving inferences from a 3 dimensional clusters.

In the 3 dimensional clusters, in addition to the existing  parameters of 2 dimensional clusters, there will also be  another parameter that would be included. This would enable  us to derive more profound inferences of the form ?What is  the support and confidence of finding a potential positive  influencer of type X inside a Market Basket Cluster between  two other types of itemset in a social media transaction (i.e. a  transaction that is build for Market Basket Analysis over  social media)?.

The figure 3 depicts this kind of analysis that was made on  the dataset.

Fig 3: A 3D Cluster Analysis of Internet v/s Business  and Entertainment  It shows a 3 dimensional correlation across a Yes-Yes, Yes-  No, No-Yes and No-No clusters between Internet and Business  Groups with Entertainment Group as the third dimension. The  clusters are depicted in such a way that the clusters are a part  of the Market Basket of Internet versus Business analysis and  the colored elements in the cluster depict the presence or  absence of the third parameter (or itemset); the red colored  items indicate that they are a part of the Entertainment group  and blue colored items indicate that they are ?not a part? of the  Entertainment group.

Through the cluster analysis, it was seen that the No-Yes,  No-No and the Yes-Yes cluster had a high support for  Entertainment and the Yes-No cluster had a low support for  Entertainment.

One possible inference that we could derive from such an  analysis is that we could exploit the possibility of using the  users as potential influencers in places of good or high  internet and business interest groups, which actually seems  very much intuitive ? the very essence of this study was to  bring out more and more inferences that usually seem non-  intuitive and non-obvious.



IV. CONCLUSION  In this paper, we have addressed a practical application of  Market Basket Analysis over Social Network Groups by  formally introducing a new and efficient paradigm for cross  marketing in Social Networks. This problem is of practical  interest, and has been extensively researched by the data  mining community in the last six years. Many researchers  have devoted much time and energy to discover clever and  fast algorithms. But, most common application of Market  Basket Analysis has been deeply concentrated in retail  business chain and there has been no work at all in using this  over the Social Media, more so, with the social network  groups.

Our proposal of this sort of modeling did not depend on  new tricks. Instead, it is carried out using a sequence of  standard calculation techniques such as frequent pattern  mining, clustering and support, confidence and interestingness  filters. But, we believe that this way of modeling Market  Baskets across social groups could be efficiently and effectively used to implement and increase cross selling and  cross marketing across social media.

This research conducted by us is very significant in this way  that, not only was it for verifying the feasibility of the  approach on practical platform, but also for building a much  needed paradigm that is necessary to bridge the gap between  transactional-real world and social media markets.

On the other hand, this is also a kind of an introductory  proof of concept seminal work that was conducted to help  inculcate a new paradigm of thoughts into the SNA arena; we  are currently working across multiple social networks and  larger datasets to try and bring out better analysis and  associations between the user-group pairs across the social  networks.
