Abstract  LDPC codes have been proposed for Flash memories due to their capability to correct higher number of bit errors. Several mechanisms can lead to bit errors in Flash memories. An ex- tensive list of these mechanisms as enlisted in [1] includes pro- gram disturb from tunneling, quantum level noise effects, er- ratic tunneling, SILC-related data retention and read disturb, and detrapping-induced retention. Each of these effects can be mod- eled as a random event with its own statistical behavior. Due to the process uncertainties in the lithography, the above mech- anisms vary from die to die leading to variability in the raw bit error rate (BER) for different dies of the Flash memory. This has an immense impact on design of error correction coding (ECC) schemes which combat the BER to achieve a specified uncor- rectable bit error rate (VBER) target. If conventional ECC tech- niques are used, they have to be designed to handle the worst die BER, which is a big overkill.

We propose a new LDPC coding scheme which exploits the BER diversity to its advantage and enables a system design for the average BER of the dies. The method is based on spreading the LDPC codeword over dies rather than packing a single LDPC codeword in one die. The system has to properly select the dies between which to split the LDPC codeword. The LDPC decod- ing has to be modified to account for the BER diversity. Simula- tions results show a large coding gain resulting from spreading a codeword, with minimal quality ofservice (QoS) impact. The im- provement stems from the fact that the codeword splitting reduces the mean and the variance of the BER distribution.

We also propose an LDPC code design which is customized to the codeword split across multiple dies. The proposed LDPC code design is on similar lines to its design for quasi-staticfading channel. The LDPC code can be designed using density evolution to obtain an optimal degree distribution for a given BER distri- bution. Simulation results for the custom-designed LDPC codes validate the hypothesis by showing appreciable coding gains.

1 Introduction  NAND Flash memory is used for data storage applications for a wide variety of consumer electronic products. Solid-state-  drives (SSD) based on Flash memories have replaced Hard-Disk- Drives (HDD) for some applications which are intensive on ran- dom access at high speeds. As Flash memory technology scales, the raw BER of the memory also increases. This calls for design of sophisticated ECC schemes to mitigate the BER and attain the specified UBER target. LDPC codes have been proposed to attain the UBER targets for NAND Flash memory based controllers.

A typical SSD comprises of Flash memory chips from various dies. Due to process variations in the lithography of Flash manu- facturing, the BER varies substantially from die-to-die. The ECC has to be designed to work at the worst case BER across all dies.

This can be a substantial overkill in terms of the amount of parity required to attain the required UBER.

We propose a modification in the ECC scheme which uses the BER diversity to its advantage. Assuming an LDPC code is being used as an ECC, we propose not to store a full LDPC codeword in a single die but to spread it across dies. The number of dies across which the codeword is split depends on the QoS. A read of a sin- gle sector requires reads from multiple dies. For higher coding gains, it is desirable to split a single codeword across large num- ber of dies. However a codeword split over larger dies impacts the system QoS. The choice of the dies over which the codeword is spread is dynamic. Since the BER of the dies degrades over the life of the device, the system has to do an allocation as it evolves.

This is not a bottleneck since SSD's have an inherent system re- build option as they have to handle die failures and also manage over-provisioning.

During read, the reliability of the bits of the LDPC codeword is computed. The reliability is a function of the BER of the die.

The reliability of the bits in the same confidence region read from a die which has low BER will be higher than the reliability of the corresponding bits read from a higher BER die. Hence, the BER of the die is a sufficient parameter to decide the scaling of the Log-Likelihood-Ratios (LLR).

We performed extensive simulations by distributing a 2 Kilo- Byte (KB) LDPC codeword over 6 dies. Unlike traditional com- munications, where coding gains are reported in terms of signal- to-noise ratio (SNR) improvements, for Flash memory, the cod- ing gains are reported as the ratio of the BER. Coding gains of 12 orders was realized under the assumption that the BER of the dies follows a log-normal distribution. 12 orders means that the BER ratio between the earlier scheme and the proposed scheme     is 12, so the split codeword scheme can tolerate a 12 times worse BER compared to the unsplit codeword scheme. For some ap- plications, 6 dies impacts the QoS and may not be feasible. For these applications, even a split of an LDPC codeword between two dies gives a coding gain of 5 orders.

It is also possible to customize the LDPC code design based on the BER diversity. The design is on similar lines of code con- struction for quasi-static fading channels. In [7], design of LDPC codes for block-fading channels and their optimization under iter- ative decoding was considered. In [2], it was shown that numeri- cal analysis techniques for calculating the threshold of the LDPC codes for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel can be applied to the uncorrelated flat Rayleigh fading channels.

Splitting of LDPC codeword over multiple dies is a similar prob- lem to transmission of an LDPC codeword over a quasi-static fading channeL Coding gains of 2 orders were realized for the LDPC code constructed for a given BER distribution compared to just splitting a code designed for an AWGN channeL  In the next section, an introduction to multi -level-cell (MLC) NAND Flash memory is presented. Since soft information is the basis of LDPC decoding, we elaborate on how soft information is obtained from NAND. Section 3 presents two LDPC schemes, one for LDPC codeword splitting across dies and the second for customized LDPC codes. Section 4 presents the simulation re- sults for the two proposed schemes.

2 NAND Flash Memory  Multi-level-cell (MLC) Flash memory comprises of cells which can be programmed to more than two levels. Recent MLC Flash memory systems support 3 bits/cell to 4 bits/cell, which means that the individual cells can be programmed to 8 or 16 distinct levels respectively. As shown in figure 1, each cell can be programmed to 8 distinct levels with each level corresponding to 3 bits of information. Programming a cell consists of adding a specified amount of charge to the floating gate by Fowler- Nordheim tunneling. To read a memory cell, a specified voltage is applied to the control gate and the transistor drain current is measured. This drain current is fed to a comparator whose other input is set to a threshold value. The output of the comparator indicates if the voltage applied to the transistor was sufficient to turn on the transistor. The comparator provides only one bit of in- formation about the charge level of the floating gate. As is shown in figure 1, the voltage applied during read of the cell to turn it on follows a probability distribution. The probability density function of the threshold voltage is modeled by a Gaussian dis- tribution. Hence, the 8-level MLC is equivalent to the 8-PAM communication system with AWGN.

During the read operation, the controller requests page infor- mation, say, a lower page read is requested. For lower page read, threshold voltage level Rl is used (figure 1). By applying a single threshold voltage, only hard information about the bit is obtained.

Figure 1. 3 bits per cell voltage level distribution for the 8 levels of the MLC Flash.

2.1 Soft Information from NAND Flash and LLR Computation  In [3], a method to obtain soft information optimized from in- formation theory perspective was proposed. The sense amplifier comparator outputs one bit of information about the threshold voltage. Using one bit of information can only provide the hard- decision correction. Soft information about a bit can be obtained by reading from the sense amplifier but applying different voltage levels to the control gate of the floating gate transistor. Hence, de- pending on the voltage applied to the control gate, we effectively partition the x-axis of figure 1 into disjoint regions and depending on the detected region, soft information is generated. If 5 distinct voltages are applied to the control gate, the x-axis is partitioned into 6 disjoint regions.

For infinite reads, the soft information for the cell voltage r is mapped to the log-likelihood-ratio (LLR). By definition, the LLR as a function of the read level information r is  LLR(r) = log p(rlx = 0) p(rlx == 1)  In the above equation if we assume that level-O has a mean volt- age level of -a and level-l has a mean voltage level of a, and (J" is the standard deviation of the noise, then  _1_ exp (_ (r-a)2) LLR(r) == log~ 2a   _1_ ex ( (r+a)2) V21ra 2 p-~  LLR(r) = 2m = 2m.

# (J"    3.2 Splitting the LDPC Codeword across Multiple Dies  3.1 Diversity Advantage for Access Speed Improve- ment  3 LDPC Encoding Schemes which Exploit Bit Er- ror Rate Diversity  In [3], it was shown that LDPC codes designed over AWGN channel are suboptimal for NAND Flash channel which is a binary-input multiple-output channel. For n-1 reads from the NAND Flash, the channel is a binary-input n-output channel. If a single LDPC codeword is split across dies, the LDPC code design has to be customized based on this split, the BER of the dies, and the binary-input n-output channel consideration. The effective channel with the LDPC codeword spilt across dies with varying BER's is similar to the block-fading channel model of wireless communications. The block-fading (BF) channel model was first introduced in [8], and further elaborated upon in [9]. This is a realistic and convenient model for a number of channels affected by slowly varying fading. The design of error-control codes for  a random variable with a normal distribution, then Y == exp(X) has a log-normal distribution. With log-normally distributed BER across dies, majority of dies will have low BER, but there will be a small fraction of dies whose BER will be in the tail end of the log-normal distribution and these dies will impair the overall system performance. For the LDPC codewords stored in the die with high BER, the probability of decode failure is high. Hence, it is advisable to split the LDPC codeword and spread it across dies. The choice of the dies over which the LDPC codeword has to be split should be such that the average BER of all codewords is almost constant. The codeword can be split equally amongst the dies or unequally depending on the variance of the log-normal distribution. Since the total number of dies with high BER are few, an unequal splitting of the codeword with a smaller chunk of the codeword in the die with high BER's turns out to be a better scheme. The extensive method of selection of dies to split the codeword across can be found in our patent application [5].

The decoding of a codeword read from multiple dies is straight-forward. During read, the portions of the codeword read from the dies with low BER's will be considered as high relia- bility information by the LDPC decoder and the portion of the codeword read from the die with high BER's will be considered as low reliability information. Since the LDPC decoder has input reliability scaled by the signal to noise ratio of the channel, it is the best way to combine the diversity and obtain diversity advan- tage. As can be observed in Eqn. (1), a natural scaling of the LLR occurs depending on the noise variance.

The number of dies across which the LDPC codeword is split has impact on the system performance. The maximum number of dies to split the codeword is decided by the QoS. The access times to procure the soft data from the NAND is an important factor. The access time gets scaled by the number of dies over which the codeword split is done.

Modest diversity gains are seen when the codeword is split over 2 dies and the gains increase as the number of dies over which the split is done increases. Splitting the codeword over 6 dies suffices to realize substantial diversity gain and splitting over more than 6 dies gives marginal diversity gain increments at the cost of high access times.

3.3 LDPC Code Construction Customized to the BER Diversity  (1)  r 1 ((r-a)2)J} --exp --- LLR(bi ) == log b  i~ 2a  r _1_ ex (_ (r+a)2) J b, V21ra2 p 2a2  We propose a method to split an LDPC codeword across dies to exploit BER diversity across dies. It is observed that the BER of the dies in an SSD follows a log-normal distribution. A log- normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. If X is  The noise variance (equivalently BER) is one primary input in deciding the LLR value assigned to a particular region. A die with higher BER (higher noise variance) has a lower value of LLR for the same region compared to a die with lower BER.

For finite number of reads, the LLR calculation gets modified depending on the region of the voltage of the cell. Let five distinct voltages be applied and let the six distinct regions be denoted by bi, i == 0 ... 5. The LLR for region b, is given by  This scheme is for systems which cannot afford to split an LDPC codeword over multiple dies due to high access speed re- quirements. For such systems, the LDPC code is designed to handle the worst case BER, hence on an average, the code is over-designed. For such cases, the BER diversity across dies can be exploited by having variable read times depending on the die BER. In [4], a method to do early reads was proposed. During a read operation from the Flash memory, the read time depends on the worst latency cells. A premature read in order to lower the read time to increase access speeds leads to an increased BER.

We propose that for dies with BER lower than the code designed value, a smaller read time can be used and for dies with higher than specified BER, full read time can be allotted. Hence BER diversity results in variable read time which gives performance advantage in terms of decreasing the average read latency.

We propose various schemes which can exploit the BER di- versity across dies in an SSD. If no LDPC codeword splitting is permissible due to QoS restrictions, the BER diversity can be used to reduce latency. This method is proposed in Section 3.1.

Section 3.2 details the scheme of splitting an LDPC codeword designed for an AWGN channel over dies. Section 3.3 proposes a BER diversity customized LDPC code design.

BF channels is a challenging problem, and differs greatly from the AWGN or independent-fading channels. In [7], a method for LDPC code construction for BF channels was proposed. This method was based on modifying the weight distribution of the four sub-matrices of the parity-check matrix. The channel was assumed to be a Rayleigh block fading channel. One of the dif- ferences between the BF channel and the NAND channel is that the BER's follow a log-normal distribution. This change can be easily incorporated in the LDPC code design by modifying the distribution of the fading channel parameters appropriately  When we simulated the LDPC codes constructed using this method, considerable performance improvement was observed.

3.4 Outage  The outage concept in wireless communications is equivalent to the case where we randomly choose dies with high BER and the code rate is higher than the capacity of the effective chan- nel (channel comprising of the combination of the dies with high BER's). This equivalent outage concept in NAND Flash occurs with a probability depending on the mean and variance of the log- normal distribution. The code rate of the LDPC code has to be chosen in order to keep this probability below a system specified limit.

4 Simulation Results  In this section, we present the simulation results with the LDPC encoding schemes proposed in the last section. For our FPGA based simulations, we use a rate 0.9 LDPC code with blocklength n == 16384 (2 Kilo-Bytes), and dimension k == 14746. We first designed the LDPC code with optimal degree distribution for the AWGN channel [6]. For all the simulations, since the UBER targets were Ie-I5, we had to perform FPGA based simulations. For the Flash memory level distributions, we used histograms obtained using actual reads from the Flash for 5 reads. In figure 2, we show plots for three schemes, one with no diversity combining, the second with diversity combining and the third with the customized LDPC code design. In the plot, the x-axis is the median BER (also called raw bit error rate (rber)) of the log-normal distribution whose variance is 6. For each point on the x-axis, we average the codeword failure rate over the log- normal probability distribution with the specified median BER value. The uncorrectable bit error rate plotted on the y-axis is then obtained from this averaged codeword failure rate.

In traditional communications, it is common to report the cod- ing gains in terms of the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) improve- ment. For NAND Flash memory, since the BER is the conven- tional metric, the ratio of the BER between the two schemes is reported as the gain. When we split the codeword across 6 dies, coding gains (in terms of BER) of 12 orders can be realized on the median log-normal BER scale. This means that the split codeword scheme gives the same UBER as the unsplit codeword scheme at a 12 times worse BER. For some applications, 6 dies may not be able to meet the system latency requirements. For   these applications, even a split of an LDPC codeword across two dies gives a coding gain of 5 orders.

Also shown in the plot are the results when the 2 Kilo-Byte LDPC code construction is customized based on the BER diver- sity. The LDPC code was designed based on split across 6 dies.

Gains of two orders were observed for this code compared to the code designed for the AWGN channel.

5 Conclusions  In this paper, we exploited the BER diversity across dies in a NAND Flash SSD to design high coding gains achieving LDPC schemes.

As a first method for BER diversity exploitation, we consid- ered variable read timings to obtain constant BER's from differ- ent dies. The advantage of this scheme is that the overall latency of the reads decreases and the ECC capability is used to its full potential for all dies.

The second method consists of splitting a single LDPC code- word across multiple dies. Since a full LDPC codeword is not stored on a single die, the problem of performance bottlenecks from dies with higher BER is circumvented. Substantial gains were realized even when a single codeword is split across two dies. There is some performance disadvantage in terms of ran- dom access speeds as the split is done over larger number of dies.

In the third method, the LDPC code design was customized under the BER diversity consideration. The design is similar to the design of LDPC codes for BF channels, the only difference being that the density evolution has to consider the log-normal distribution of the BER. The interpretation of outage for tradi- tional wireless channels translates to the choice of high BER's dies for LDPC codeword splitting. Simulations were done with the customized LDPC code and improvements of two orders were realized compared to the same configuration with AWGN LDPC codes.
