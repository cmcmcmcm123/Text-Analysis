Abstract - A mobile agent is a program that can travel during execution from one system to another system in a massive network. Mobile agent interacts with static agents and other resources to perform its task autonomously. Mobile agents are particularly attractive in distributed information retrieval applications. This paper discusses about how to parallelize the incremental algorithm for mining distributed dynamic datasets.

This minimizes communication overhead between distributed systems and the central system. In this distributed approach, we use static agents at each distributed local system which are capable of generating local model (each static agent has a summary of its own database) as well as the global model ( carries the summary of the entire data base) of the frequent item sets. This ability permits our system to generate high contrast frequent item sets, which allow us to examine how the data is positioned over different systems. Using the capabilities of the mobile agent, the knowledge could be retrieved from the local systems to the central system for making the communication process better and easier between the distributed systems.



I.   INTRODUCTION  Analysis of past transaction data provide very valuable information for the decision making purpose [3]. The problem of extracting knowledge is a difficult task for large datasets due to their static nature and geographical distribution datasets [1]. Due to these properties, algorithms that handle large datasets cannot assume or control the partitioned structure, the sizes, and the location of the pieces of the datasets and must take account of the latencies and bandwidth required to move data among the places.

Mobile agent is a composition of software and data which can move from one system to another system autonomously in a distributed network. These programs are capable of suspending their execution on one platform and moving to another platform where they resume execution. Mobile Agent?s application proves to be one of the best and robust methods to handle the distributed data and hence distributed data mining [4].

In this paper we have focused to increase the performance of existing algorithm by inducing parallel computing with the help of co-operative mobile and static agents. Here the static agent computes with the data in the local host automatically whenever it detects a change. Static agents do not move around the distributed databases but use embedded  knowledge to assist in filtering and processing the volume of data. Later, the mobile agent interacts and retrieves required data from the static agents that are residing in the local systems.



II.   MOTIVATIONS AND RELATED WORK  A common approach for mining distributed data systems is the centralized one, in which all data is moved to a single central location and then mined. Another approach is the local one, where models are built locally at each site, and then moved to a common location where they are combined [2].

The later approach is the quickest but often least accurate, while the former approach is more accurate but generally quite expensive in terms of time required.

These existing approaches for Distributed Data Mining  suffer from one or more of the following disadvantages.

Lack of coordination among the distributed sites  while generating the local knowledge, affects the  quality of global knowledge [1]  Non-flexibility in addition of new algorithm to its  knowledge base [1]  Capability to dynamically discover data sites  based on user requirements [1]  Network overhead, communication overhead and  time overhead  In our proposed work, with the use of the co-operative agents we are trying to minimize the above flaws prevailing in the existing works.



III. PROPOSED WORK  To improve the accuracy of the knowledge obtained from the local model, strong association rules between the item sets are established. The decisions are derived based on the association rules. Static agents residing in the local system compute the local models, and are brought to the central system for combining them to generate global model at the central system based on which global knowledge is mined.

Knowledge from distributed sites is extracted in the form of association rules. Based on the types of values, the association rules can be classified into two categories [1]:       Example:  Boolean Association Rules: Keyboard       Mouse [ Support = 6%, Confidence = 70% ]  Quantitative Association Rules: (Age = 26?30)      (Cars =   1, 2) [Support 3%, Confidence = 36%]  A. Basic Concepts  Generally the Distributed Data Mining process consists of  the following steps [1]:  Generate the knowledge locally at each  distributed sites by means of a static agent.

Integrate the local distributed knowledge  model to get global knowledge model  Analyze to check the quality of the global  model    The terminologies used in this algorithm proposed are as below:  DB                Database  D                   Number of Transactions  n                    Number of Distributed systems (S1, S2, ? Sn)  DBi              Distributed Data sets at Si,  DB = U DBi, i=1 to n  XSup             Support count of a X at DB ? Global  XSupi            Support count of a X at DBi ? Local  Minsup          Minimum support threshold  GFI               Global Frequent Item set  CGFI             Candidate Global Frequent Item set  X                   Global Frequent Item set  if XSup?Minsup * D  LFi                 Local Frequent Item set at system i  PGFI              Possible Global Frequent Item sets  (not part of LFIi, but by adding these  counts   at  Central system converts CGFI to GFI)  SAi                 Static Agent at each distributed system from  I = 1 to n  B.  Proposed Algorithm  Input: Distributed dataset DBi, i=1to n, Minsup  Output: Global Frequent Item set (GFI)  1. Sending mining agent to all sites  For I = 1 to n do  {  MA.send (Location = I, S=Support, Addresses of all  Distributed sites);  }    2. a. Each static agent (SAi) computes LFi in parallel  b. Each cooperative agent gets LFIi from SAi and  sends it to neighbors and the central system    3. a. Compute GFI and CGFI at central system  GFI?LFIi, I = 1 to n; CGFI=ULFIi - ?LFI, i=1to n  b. Calculate PGFI and their count at each distributed  system and send it to the central system  PGFIj = All Item sets at site j ?LFIi, i=1to n, i<>j  4. Calculate GFI at central system using PGFI count  For all X ? CGFI do  {  If X.Sup=?X.Supi, i=1to n ?MinSup*D then  {  GFI = GFI U {X}  }  }    The above Fig.2 depicts the functioning of our proposed algorithm. Mobile agents are directed towards the distributed systems with the static agents and pass the query.

The static agents then process the query to generate LFIi accordingly. The calculated LFIi is then sent to the neighboring systems and to the central system. Based on the received LFIi, the central system calculates GFI and CGFI based on the Minsup.

Fig.2: Data mining in Distributed Communication  Systems         Now the infrequent item sets are analyzed and a PGFI count is computed by static agents and sent to the central system. With the PGFI count, the central site calculates the final GFI which is then updated in the global knowledge. This makes the process of decision making more efficient. In this analysis we have utilized the features of the JADE mobile agent [7].



IV. APPLICAION IN ROBITICS  The decision making process makes the system to take a decision by learning from distributed datasets. For this association rule mining with supervised learning technique is used for machine learning by creating a function from training data. The global knowledge will be useful for the central system to effectively control the distributed systems with effective communication using the agents. Robotics which are based on distributed datasets can effectively implement this proposed algorithm to make decision making easier.



V. CONCLUSION  In  this paper we have focused the problems of mining  frequent item sets on dynamic and distributed data sets in  different parallel and distributed systems using mobile and  static agents. We proposed an approach to minimize the  response time and increase the accuracy of knowledge  mining for the global set of frequent item sets, as well as to  find frequent item patterns in infrequent item sets.  In the  future work the concept of static agents can be replaced by  indexing techniques and can be applied in areas like  robotics, unmanned vehicles etc to make the communication  process between the distributed systems in an effective way.
