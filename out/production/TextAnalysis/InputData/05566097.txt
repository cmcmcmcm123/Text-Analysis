I.  INTRODUCTION At present, data mining is the most active branch of  database research, development and application, and it also has been studying the hot. In recent years, in the process of the rapid development of data mining research and application, our predecessors have achieved certain results [4-6]. With the new and improved algorithms for emerging, the richer the type of data study, the gradual expansion of application fields, data mining technology is gradually integrated into the multimedia database.

Because of the large amount of data, data structure complexity, patterns and diverse characteristics, the study of multimedia database has been a difficult one. With the success of data mining technology, people will look into a multimedia database for knowledge discovery. Data mining technology and multimedia information processing technology are organically combined form in the multimedia data to knowledge discovery, like this information processing method is multimedia data mining. In multimedia miner, such as ?Find all images containing human faces?, the user interface will be gradually shown in different countries, different color, different expressions of the human face, not some Houlian or Malian.

Thus it can be seen, multimedia mining is from a large number of multimedia data sets, through comprehensive analysis of audio-visual features and semantic, finding implicit, effective, valuable, and understandable patterns, arriving at the incident trends and relations, in order to provide users with problem- solving ability level of decision support [2]. Based on the characteristics of Multimedia Database, although the multimedia data mining has attracted wide attention, it is also at the study start-up and exploration stage, Multimedia mining architecture and framework will be further studied, and the suitable for multimedia data mining method has also yet to be made.



II. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF MULTIMEDIA DATA MINING  With the popular and universal of the audio and video equipment, digital camera, CD-ROM and the Internet, Multimedia database system is becoming increasingly common. It stores and manages a large number of multimedia data sets in multimedia database system, such as audio, video, images, graphics, sounds, text, documents and hypertext data.

These multi-media information don?t have uniform structure and a unified approach, that, multimedia data is usually a multi-dimensional, unstructured or semi-structured, each media data has different characteristics, their own way of presentation of information, each media cannot only present the information separately but also can co-express the different characteristics of the same events, co-describe the existence, development and result of the event. So, there must be the main features of information, attributes and the relationship between them in multimedia data sets, or some models what people cannot get intuitively. Multimedia data mining is an intelligent data analysis, aimed at finding necessary results for making decision, countermeasures and fusion analysis from specific multimedia data sets.

According to the data stored in multimedia database, multimedia database is mainly used in content-based image retrieval, sound delivery system, video on demand system, World Wide Web and identify the password command voice- based user interface, and etc. Multimedia Mining mainly from the following five fronts: Image Mining, Video Mining, Audio Mining, Web Mining and Multi-Media Integrated Mining.

Image mining is introduced the data mining technology into the image field of study, to discover the information and knowledge that hidden in a large number of image data, the non-trivial process of identifying hidden, valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable semantics of information and knowledge from complex image data.

Multimedia database supports for large objects, such as video, audio this data objects may reach a few megabytes of storage, these continuous media data need to be stable, pre-determined rate of real-time search, in order to prevent the image or sound from intermittent and the system buffer overflow. For these two kinds of mining, they need to integrate store and search technologies and standard data mining together. Web mining is the applications of data mining on the Web, it uses data mining technology from the resources associated with the WWW and behavior of interest drawn, useful pattern and implicit information, related to Web technology, data mining, computational linguistics, information science and other     fields, it is a comprehensive technology. Web Mining contains the following two kinds: ?Web content mining. It refers to mine the Web page content and back-office database is the process of obtaining useful knowledge from Web document content and its described contents of the information. It also can mine between organizational structure and links, to obtain useful knowledge from the artificial link structure. As the interconnection between the documents, WWW can provide useful information in addition to document content. Though the use of this information, you can sort the page, find the important pages. ?Web usage record mining. It is through mining the corresponding sites? log files and related data to discover the site visitor behavior patterns, is the process to obtain valuable information. Above four aspects of mining are belong to single media mining, Multi-Media mining is organic integration in the process of kinds of single media data mining, comprehensive utilization of various media to achieve the purpose of knowledge discovery.



III. THE SYSTEM MODEL OF MULTI-MEDIA MINING Multimedia data mining system emerges based on the  development of content-based multimedia data retrieval system. At present, multimedia mining exists in main issues include: system framework model, multimedia mining needs a practical system framework model. Its general system structure model is shown in Figure 1.Below it will describe briefly the main function of the module in Figure 1.

?Multimedia database  Multimedia database contains vast amounts of multimedia information such as audio, images and video binary data that are needed computer to handle, it is unstructured, we can not simply be expressed in mathematical analysis. Multimedia database must obtain the interpretations of content and information features based on these media objects, to complete the storage and retrieval application, the interpretations which obtained are called metadata. Content- based metadata is related to the media information attributes, can not complete individually or automatically according to their content, must use the user?s descriptions or characteristics of media content to outline the characteristics of media objects. Basic media metadata includes text metadata, audio metadata, image metadata and video metadata, they constitute the basis for data accessing, and this is a prerequisite for efficient multimedia data mining.

Figure 1. Based on multimedia data mining model  ?Data Pre-Processor   Data pre-processing is to clean the data, the data stored in the database must be the necessary checks and purification, used to identify and correct or eliminate conflicts, incomplete data and combination of a database shared by the incompatibility. Data preprocessing main includes data cleaning, data integration, data transformation and data reduction. ?Data Cleaning: It mainly through the fill in missing values, smooth noisy data, identify or delete outliers and to resolve inconsistencies to ?clean up? data. If the users think the data is dirty, and then they will not believe data mining results, in addition, dirty data will cause chaos in data mining process and result in unreliable output.

?Data Integration: It is data storage, which data what come from different data sources integrate into the same. Metadata, correlation analysis, data conflict detection and resolution of semantic heterogeneity have contributed to the smooth integration of data. The image on behalf of the sun has different name in each database, one is called ?taiyang?, another is called ?sun?, now combination will lead to inconsistency and redundancy, it should be avoided. ?Data Transformation: It is transforming the original and real data in the database into the suitable form for data mining. There are many image formats, so formats should be standardized, consistent in the same database. ?Data Reduction: Data cube aggregation, attribute subset selection, dimension reduction, value reduction and discrimination can be used to obtain the data reduction, to minimize the loss of information content.

(3)Mining Engine It is composed by a group of highly efficient and fast algorithms; these include classification, clustering, association summary and trend analysis, etc. For a particular task multimedia database, we should accord the results of data preprocessing to judge, and to choose efficient, appropriate algorithms.

(4)User Mining Interface It is the visual tool for artificial analysts using, and also is a platform for data mining to output the result. According to the end user?s mission requirements and objectives, for the model of the excavation or the most valuable thing, you can use forms to express, including: rules, tables, pie, cube, curve, etc. With easy and straightforward  Multimedia Database  Specific multimedia  data excavator  User mining interface  Mining Engine: classification,  clustering, association summary, trend  analysis, etc  Data preprocessor  Mining exploration  module data data    Multimedia data cube    way to present the result of exploitation for user, visually present the narrative and causation of the facts and events.



IV.  MULTIMEDIA DATA MINING METHOD  A.    Multimedia data cube For multimedia data mining, according to the  characteristics of multimedia data, you need to integrate store and search technologies and standard data mining method together. Promising approach involves multimedia data cube construction, multi-feature extraction of multimedia data and pattern matching based on similarity [3].

Design and construction of multimedia data cube is to multi-dimensional analysis of large multimedia database, is a kind of method which is similar to structure the traditional data cube from relation data. Multimedia data cube can contain dimension and magnanimity for multimedia information, such as color, texture and shape. Data cube is created to contribute to multi-dimensional analysis and a variety of knowledge mining of multimedia data based on visual content, including the summary, comparison, classification, association and clustering.

Multimedia data cube can be many dimensional, for example: color, position, texture, keywords, image size or video bytes, image or video format type, image or video of the Internet domain, etc. Some of these properties many of which are set-oriented values, rather than single-valued. For example, an image may correspond to a set of keywords. It may contain a set of objects; each object corresponds to a set of colors. When design the data cube, if each keyword or each color is as a one dimension, this will lead the Victoria Disaster. Other hand, the dimension is too small, resulting in scale modeling of the image is too rough, limited and imprecise. Therefore, the design should be based on actual needs to balance processing efficiency and expressive power of multimedia data cube. Figure 2 is a simple model of image data cube. Multimedia data cube is an interesting model of multi-dimensional analysis for multimedia data, through the appropriate number of operations: roll-up, drill-down, slice and dice, shaft (rotation) can be a powerful analysis.

Figure 2.  Data cube model  B.     Clustering Technology of Multimedia Data Mining Cluster analysis makes a data object decompose or divide  into multiple classes, or clusters, so that the same class of data  objects has a high similarity, but with other types of data objects has a great difference as far as possible. It is also a collection of data objects for analysis, and it is different from classification is that classification is a good pre-defined data types, and selects the known class labels of training data sets, belongs to supervised learning or guide learning. The clustering is an unsupervised learning, does not rely on training examples of predefined classes and class labels.

According to describe the object?s property values, the object dissimilarity between the commonly is used distance metric to evaluate. Commonly used distance functions include: Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance, Minknowski distance, Manhattan distance, etc.

Cluster analysis has a wide range of applications, including market or customer segmentation, pattern recognition, biological research, spatial data analysis, Web document classification, etc. Cluster analysis can be used as separate data mining tools to gain understanding of the distribution of data, and can also be other the preprocessing step of data mining algorithms for found in clusters.

C.     Classification Techniques of Multimedia Data Mining Classification is a technique for multimedia data analysis,  can learn from each property of a given set of multimedia divided into a predefined class label, so as to achieve the purpose of classification. Classifier is shown in Figure 3.With the tuple (x, y) that, where x is the set of attributes, while the y is a sample class label.

Figure 3.  Classifier  Data classification can be achieved through the following two-step: ? Establishing classifiers of describing the predefined data types or concept sets. Classification is usually based on a particular characteristic of the media data to determine, the characteristic in the Meta database is demonstrated as audio-visual descriptors. By analyzing the descriptor?s value of part data in Meta database to construct the model, and make the media data which were used to create model as a training set. Training samples can be randomly selected, and give class label in advance. ?Using model to classify. First, assess the prediction accuracy of classifier, with a given accuracy on the test set to determine the accuracy of classifier, if the classifier accuracy is acceptable, you can use it to classify the next tuple. Classification is a gradual process of fine, pairs with the same type of label of the media data sets can also be classified in accordance with the above steps to continue. Commonly used classification can also use decision tree classification method, rule-based classification, neural networks, support vector machines and Na?ve Bayes classification, etc.

D.     The Association Rules of Multimedia Data Mining    Very Big Big Middle Small  Cyan  Right Left  Down Up  Size  Green  Red  Blue  Color  Orientation      The association rules mining of Multimedia data is from relevant data sets of image and video database to find the model which is shown frequent data item sets in the database, to predict the powerful decision-making based on the model.

A typical association rules is: X?Y[S%,C%],where X and Y are a group of characteristics described predicate, S% is the support of rule(In all possible cases, X and Y appear together with the probability ),C% is the rule confidence(the conditional probability of Y occur while under the conditions of X occurs). Similarly, supposing D for the image collection, image mining association rules can also be expressed as: P1? P2???Pn?Q1?Q2???Qm[S%,C%],where P1? P2?Pn?Q1?Q2?Qm is the description predicate of image in D, can be the image size ,color ,texture, density, keywords, objects, spatial location, text description, etc, S% still represents the support of rules, C% represents the confidence of rules.

Definition 1 If containing the ratio of image attributes P? Q in D is Sup, then the association rule P? Q in D has support(Support) Sup,   ( ) 100%Support P QSup  n ?= ?                             (1)  In which, Support(P?Q) is the number of attribute sets which support P?Q in the database, n is the total number of attribute sets in the database.

Definition 2 If the ratio of D contains Q when D contains the attribute set of P is Conf, then the association rule P?Q in D sets with the confidence Conf.

( ) 100% ( )  Sup P QConf Sup P  ?= ?                                        (2)  Where Sup (P?Q) is the support of P?Q, Sup (p) is the support degree of p. The mining problem of association rules is to generate the association rules of which can meet all user- specified minimum support (minsup) and minimum confidence (minconf), and then the support and confidence of these association rules were not less than the minimum support and minimum confidence. Image database is shown in Table 1, in which property I1 presents large size of image,I2 presents the keyword ?sky?, I3 presents the texture ?transparent?, I4 presents the color ?blue?, I5 presents the format ?JPEG?.

TABLE I. EXAMPLES OF MULTIMEDIA DATA TID Attribute Sets 1 I1,I2,I5  2 I2,I3,I4  3 I3,I4  4 I1,I2,I3,I4  Supposing minsup=50%,then I={I2,I3,I4} is the frequent attribute set, the non-empty subset of I is  {I2,I3},{I2,I4},{I3,I4},{I2},{I3}and{I4}.The corresponding association rules are:  I2?I3? I4     conf=2/2=100%                                     ? I2?I4? I3     conf=2/2=100%                                     ? I3?I4? I2     conf=2/3=67%                                       ? I2? I3?I4     conf=2/3=67%                                       ? I3? I2?I4     conf=2/3=67%                                       ? I4? I2?I3     conf=2/3=67%                                       ?  If the minimum confidence minconf=80%, then the result of final output will only generate (1), (2) two rules, that is strong association rules. Under the strong association rules can be inferred the following two decisions: ?The sky of texture transparent is very likely blue? and ?The texture of blue sky most likely is transparent?. Through the above examples, as can be seen, association rules? mining is divided into the following two sub-problems: ?To identify all frequent item sets. The appear frequency of each data?s described characteristics is at least the same degree of support, this belongs to the frequent item sets, as this to identify all; ?To generate the strong association rules by frequent item sets: Focus on identifying the frequent items to meet the minimum degree of confidence, that is, meeting the strong rules.



V. CONCLUSION This paper introduces a framework for multimedia data  mining system, to illustrate the general process of multimedia data mining. At the same time, it has proposed several mining methods, but a description is primarily based on association rule. Multimedia data mining is the combination of data mining and multimedia database, it isn?t only an emerging research direction, but is also a challenging field of study, in future multimedia database mining is mainly content-based intelligent data retrieval, cross-index of a variety of media will also become a research hotspot, mining for multimedia data and intelligent information retrieval are the needs of future development.
