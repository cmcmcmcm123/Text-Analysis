Particle Swarm Optimization-based Impurity Function Band Prioritization Using  Weighted Majority Voting for Feature Extraction of High Dimensional Data Sets

Abstract?In recent years, with the improvement of sensor technologies, the volumes of remote sensing data are increased dramatically. The feature extraction of hyperspectral remotely sensed images can reduce such high-dimensional datasets, solve the big data problem, avoid the Hughes phenomena and improve the classification performance. Accordingly, this paper presents a framework for feature extraction of hyperspectral imagery, which consists of two approaches, referred to as parallel particle swarm optimization (PPSO) band selection and weighted voting impurity function (WVIF) band prioritization. The highly correlated bands of hyperspectral imagery can be grouped first into the some modules by PPSO band selection algorithm to coarsely reduce high-dimensional datasets, and these highly correlated band modules can then be analyzed with the statistical relationship between bands and classes by WVIF band prioritization method to finely select the most important feature bands form the datasets. Furthermore, a PPSO algorithm based on modern graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture using NVIDIA compute unified device architecture (CUDA) technology is using in this paper. It can improve the computational speed of PPSO band selection to group the high correlated band modules. The effectiveness of the proposed PPSO/WVIF framework is evaluated by MASTER and AVIRIS hyperspectral images. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method not only could reduction the dimension of datasets, but also can offer a satisfactory classification performance and computational speed.

I.  INTRODUCTION Due to recent advances in remote sensing instruments the  number of spectral bands used in these instruments to collect data has significantly increased. The advances of sensor technologies make it possible to utilize a growing number of spectral bands. High-dimensional remote sensing data sets obtained from multispectral, hyperspectral or even ultraspectral bands generally provide enormous spectral information for data analysis. But this improved spectral resolution also comes at a price, known as the curse of dimensionality. The term curse of dimensionality is used by the statistical community to describe the difficulties  associated with the feasibility of distribution estimation in high-dimensional data sets. The datasets cover an abundance of applications from satellite remote sensing imaging to medical examination imaging. World-wide researchers all report the difficulties, regarding its distribution estimation.

Accordingly, how to extract the most valuable and meaningful information has become much more essential.

Pearson proposed a principal component analysis (PCA)  [1] to convert a set of correlated high-dimensional data variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables for feature extraction. A technique known as greedy modular eigenspaces (GME) [2] has been developed for the band selection of hyperspectral datasets. GME attempts to greedily select a near-optimal unique feature set from hyperspectral images. A new simulated annealing band selection (SABS) [3] based on GME is also reported to improve to the performances of GME feature extraction.

Recently, Chang et al. presented a novel parallel band  selection approach, referred to as parallel particle swarm optimization (PPSO) [4], for hyperspectral feature extraction.

They also introduced a novel band prioritization based on impurity function (IF) [5] for hyperspectral band selection.

The proposed IF band selection (IFBS) used PPSO scheme to develop an effective feature extraction algorithm for hyperspectral imagery. After PPSO method is applied to the band reduction of hyperspectral images, the proposed IFBS is applied to enhance the efficiency of band selection.

In this paper, an improved version of feature extraction  scheme, namely weighted voting impurity function (WVIF), based on IFBS algorithm is proposed by using a novel weighted majority voting system to finely select the most important feature bands form the highly correlated bands collected coarsely by PPSO band selection approach. The new proposed PPSO/WVIF framework fully utilize the PPSO approach on coarse-grain band selection and the WVIF scheme on fine-grain feature extraction for hyperspectral images. Furthermore, a modern graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture using NVIDIA compute unified device architecture (CUDA) technology is used to speed up  PPSO algorithm in this paper. It can improve the   DOI 10.1109/.123    DOI 10.1109/.123    DOI 10.1109/.123    DOI 10.1109/ICPADS.2013.124      Figure 1.

computational speed of PPSO band selection to group the high correlated band modules.

The efficiency of proposed method is evaluated by  MODIS/ASTER airborne simulator (MASTER) hyperspectral images and AVIRIS hyperspectral images. The experimental results demonstrated that proposed method can obtain significant feature bands in terms of the efficiency of dimension reductions and classification. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the proposed methods. Experimental results are shown in section III. Finally, we draw our conclusion in Section  IV.



II. METHODOLOGY   A. Reviews of GME   In Fig.1, a visual correlation matrix pseudo-color map (CMPM) is used to emphasize the second-order statistics in hyperspectral data and to illustrate the magnitude of correlation matrices in the proposed PPSO method. In our previous works, we proposed a GME set which is composed of a group of modular eigenspaces for the class k as also shown in Fig. 1. Reordering the bands regardless of the original order in terms of wavelengths in high-dimensional data sets is an important characteristic of the GME. Each modular eigenspace includes a set of highly correlated bands.

In hyperspectral imagery, GME has been developed by clustering highly correlated hyperspectral bands into a smaller subset of band modular based on greedy algorithm.

B. PPSO/IFBP  Figure 2. The flow chart of PPSO/IFBP framework.

Starting from the raw data through the process of band selection to perform the classification, the whole PPSO/IFBP classification flow for hyperspectral images is shown in the Fig.2. It would be summarized into four steps:   1. Slice out training samples and test samples from raw data  and normalize them.

2. Realize the single class high correlation bands of PPSO  algorithm.

3. Use IFBP statistics the relationship between classes and  bands and to reduce the data dimensionality by using the weighted majority voting to extracting the key bands as the representatives.

4. Finally, use k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier to produce the classification map from the selected bands.

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a swarm  intelligence algorithm originally designed to solve the nonlinear function optimization and neural network training problems [6]. PPSO scheme is a well-known method to solve the heuristic optimization problems. PPSO band selection [5] can group highly correlated bands of hyperspectral images into several high corrected modules. However, the PPSO is difficult to identify which bands are the most significant bands in each high corrected module for the image classification. IFBP [5] is incorporated with PPSO band selection to improve the band prioritization while increasing classification accuracy.

After applying PPSO band selection to hyperspectral images, the IFBP is then deployed for band prioritization. A visualization of the IFBP method is shown in Fig 2. There are two classes (A and B) and two bands (bm and bn) in this example. In Fig. 3, one training sample of class A and three training samples  of class  B  are overlapped within the two     Figure 3. A visualization of the proposed IFBP method.

dotted lines in band bm. One training sample of class A and five training samples of class B are overlapped within the two dotted lines in band bn. The IFBP measures the sample probabilities of overlapped structure by an impurity function [7]. The measure of the class overlapping (Ob) based on IFBP for band #b is defined in Eq. (1).

,))(1(  O C  C  22? ?? ? ??? i j jib pp            (1)   where i ? j, b represents the band #b and C is the total number of classes. pi and pj are the sample probabilities of overlapped structure between class i and class j in band bm and band bn, e.g., pi is 1/6 of class A and pj is 5/6 of class B for band bm as shown in Fig 3. There are totally fifteen (6 x 5)/2 combination measures of? Ob when six different classes (C = 6) are applied to IFBP. They are then summed up to calculate a total of Ob. If the value of Ob is 1, it means that no classes are overlapped to each other in band b. The minimum value of Ob is 1 - C. In this case, the training pixels of all classes are fully mixed.

C. WVIF   As shown in Fig.1, a visual CMPM is used to illustrate the magnitude of correlation matrices. The GME set is composed of a group of modular eigenspaces for the class k as also shown in Fig. 4. The GME ?k is the set of GME modules for different k classes, where k ?{1,?,C} and nk  is the number of modular eigenspace for ?k. ?lk represents the l modular eigenspace of ?k, where , and mk represents the number of bands in ?lk. Ob is the class   Figure 5. The within-class statistics for the WVIF band prioritization of Class #1 and Class #2.

overlapping as reported in the previous subsection. The proposed WVIF method makes use of both the model of the GME ?k and the order of the class overlapping Ob  (the more, the better) to select the most important band in different ?lk based on the bands statistical relationship of the within-class as shown in Fig. 5 and between-class as shown in Fig. 6.

These two statistics (within-class and between-class) are then summed up by their order of class overlapping Ob. Finally,     ? Figure 8. Data flow comparison between PSO (running in CPU) and PPSO (running in GPU) approaches.?  the most important feature bands are selected, including Band #1, #2, #4 and #5 in this case, as shown in Fig. 7.

As a result, the highly correlated bands of hyperspectral imagery can be grouped first into the some modules by PPSO band selection algorithm to coarsely reduce high- dimensional datasets, and these highly correlated band modules can then be analyzed with the statistical relationship between bands and classes by WVIF band prioritization method to finely select the most important feature bands form the datasets.

D. Parallel Computing Process The natural parallelism of proposed PSO is in the face  that each particle can be regarded as an independent agent.

Parallel computation benefits the algorithm by providing each agent with one of the parallel processors [8]. The intrinsic parallel characteristics embedded in the proposed PPSO can be therefore suitable for a parallel implementation.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS In this paper, two plantation areas are chosen for  investigation. They are the MASTER set of Au-Ku and the AVIRIS set of Northwest Tippecanoe County (NTC). At Au-Ku data set, 30 training samples and 120 testing samples for each class with 44 bands, there were 6 classes in this data set; at NTC data set, 20 training samples and 80 testing samples for each class with 220 bands, there were 9 classes in this data set. Five correlation coefficient (CC) thresholds, CC = 0.7 ?0.9 with a offset of 0.05, were selected to carry out the experiments. The parameters used for PSO are initialized as follows. The inertia weight ? is set as 0.8 to 0.4. The acceleration constants (cognitive confidence coefficients) c1 is 2 and c2 is 1.25. All of the multiple combinations of parameters stated above are averaged to obtain the experimental results.

Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 summarize the evaluation results of qualities of solutions to illustrate the validity of proposed method. The criteria for the evaluation in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 are based on the same quality of solutions and the same period of time experimented with different benchmarks.

Furthermore, an evaluation of classification efficiency (CE = ?),    VCA DRR? ?  (2)   as shown in Fig. 11 in next page, is also designed to validate the significant contributions of proposed method.

Fig. 12 shown the DRR comparison between proposed method and PPSO, is also designed to validate the significant contributions of proposed method.

The results appeared in Fig. 11 show that an efficient critical point around CC = 0.7 can be reached to obtain a high quality DRR along with a lower VCA impact. In the proposed parallel PPSO, the speedup almost proportional to amount of the number of particles with two sets of image data as shown in Fig. 13. The more particles the better the speedups. This result can well demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed PSO process.



IV. CONCLUSION In this paper, we propose the PSO/WVIF framework for  feature extraction of hyperspectral imagery. Firstly, the PSO band selection algorithm can grouped highly correlated bands of hyperspectral imagery into the some modules to coarsely reduce high-dimensional datasets.  Secondly, these highly correlated band modules can then be statistically analyzed among bands and classes by WVIF band prioritization method to finely select the most important feature bands form the datasets. In order to speed up the proposed processes, a parallel PSO algorithm based on modern graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture using NVIDIA compute unified device architecture (CUDA) technology is implemented in this paper to improve the computational speed of PSO band selection to group the high correlated band modules. The effectiveness of the proposed PSO/WVIF framework is evaluated by MASTER and AVIRIS hyperspectral images. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method not only could reduction the dimension of datasets, but also can offer a satisfactory classification performance and computational speed.
