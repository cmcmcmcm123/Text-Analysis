Key words: big organization; theoretical framework; culture entropy reduction theory of the big organization; collaborative innovation theory of the big organization; culture entropy change model; collaborative innovation model    1 Introduction We are now living in the internet era, where the computers, people are connected in a huge system. In  this system, information exchange frequently and the amount of information (data quantity) continue to expand. The model of frequent interaction between human beings, between human and machine give rise to constant change in morphologies and patterns of organization. In addition, the interaction between environment and human in this era is highlighted and the environment is the ?soil? human-beings depending on. The view that each individual is the historic and cultural individual breaks boundaries of information society and highlights the role as one side of interaction for the first time, which affects humans and other individuals greatly and can not be ignored. The cultural, resources and geographic barriers that existed among societies in the past could not hamper the flow of information any longer and the flow of information promotes the speed and quantity of innovation greatly. The more active rapid growth of cells in the body tissue more active the more stable is not specific to an individual within the organization form.

In the Internet era, the concept of management is changing, as a result of which cooperative business philosophy has gone mainstream at present, the competitive relation between enterprises will continue to be diluted, while collaborative organizations similar to the supply chains, virtual enterprises will continue to emerge.

In the Era of big data, the global economy is facing great challenges and the way we understand and form the society was changed either.

Faced with the feature of 21th contrary, Prof. Xu xusong put forward the Complexity Science management (CSM) theory. The hypothesis of CSM ? organization is a systematic Thinking brain means that each organization features intelligence and intelligent structure.

Given the above, this paper proposes a brand new concept of ?large organization?, a new theory put forward based on CSM ideas. This paper will introduce the basic implication, theoretical framework, cultural entropy reduction theory and collaboration innovation theory of the large organization.

2 Big organization Big organization is a concept. It is based on CSM Systems thinking1 as the core, an intelligent  structure consisting of perspective, idea, platform, mode of operation, and theory. The target is providing the organization with wisdom.

Big organizations understand organization as: consisting of three components - element, structure, and function. Tangible elements include: buildings, people, funds, books, computer ? Intangible elements include: reputation, recognition, organizational culture, innovation and creativity?  Structure refers to the links or relationships between elements, including both within the organization and outside the organization. Link is general connections by means of Internet resources. Function is the ability to achieve goals.

The three components with organization form its stock, which is the organization's long-term accumulation.

Organization in big organization is a smart body, which is shown in Figure 1.1.

Figure 1.1   Smart body  Larger the stock in smart body, more powerful the organization is. Big organizations believe that, in order to make individuals more powerful, we need to increase the stock. Approaches to increase the stock are: ?enhance the amount of inflows. Inflows come from many outside organizations and greater environment. ?have outflows at the same time. Outflows go to many outside organizations and greater environment. ? form a loop with stock, inflows, and outflows .

The proposal of big organization changed our way of thinking, that is: do not just consider issues based on existing stock of organization and individuals; in order to make the organization stronger,  CSM system thinking  Stock  Perspective  Idea  Theory   Platform  Operation mode     we must resort to other organizations and environmental forces, that is to have inflows; at the same time, we should also promote other organizations and environment to be powerful, this is the outflow. Only if other organizations and environment become more powerful, organization and individuals can become more powerful. This is the organization's wisdom. Big organization is a smart body. Big organization?s thinking ? stock, inflows and outflows forming a loop, is shown in Figure 1.2.

Figure 1.2   stock, inflows, and outflows form a loop  Therefore, big organization refers to an organization large enough to go beyond national boundaries, beyond the boundaries of specific industries. It is "big" in terms of geographic boundaries, but also a transnational organization, and "big" the in terms of culture and psychology. The "big" means an organization can operate either according to Eastern culture or Western culture.

The boundaries of big organizations are not based on administrative boundaries, nor are determined by upstream and downstream relationship of the industry chain.  They are based on the organization?s needs and rely on people's imagination. Meanwhile, organizational boundaries and constantly changing, i.e., big organization has the characteristics of no boundaries. This feature makes the flow of information fast and convenient, and easy to disclose and share information.

3 Intellectual structure of big organization Big organizational intellectual structure includes five aspects: big organization?s perspective; big organization?s concept; big organization?s mode of operation; big organization?s platform; big organization?s theory.

3.1 Big organization?s perspective  inflow  inflow  inflow  outflow  inflow  Smart body  Stock  Environment  inflow  outflow  Smart body  Stock  inflow  outflow  Smart body  Stock  Smart body  Stock  Smart body  Stock  inflow  inflow  inflow  outflow     Big organization?s perspective includes: ? Overall perspective - based on the CSM overall theory. Overall perspective treats organizational behavior from the heterogeneity of time and space, namely: organization's constituent elements, in addition to the tangible, more attention paid to the intangible, such as the organization's reputation, recognition ?; organization?s structure, in addition to connection among constituent elements within the organization, should also consider the relationship among the various connections outside the organization; organization?s function, in addition to existing features, should be goal-oriented and change its function, and also change the connection among elements.

?Dynamic perspective - based on CSM interaction theory. Dynamic perspective treats organizational behavior from interaction among individuals within organization, interaction among organizations, interaction between organization and environment, namely: Attention should be paid to self organization, which is a very important capability and will produce heterogeneity, unpredictability, and even a new organization and evolve into a new pattern of behavior; attention should be paid to the dynamics of coordination with other organizations, common value upgrade; organization cannot just concern about stability, productivity but should also pay attention to adaptation, including anti-aggravation and the ability to restore function.

? New resource perspective ? based on CSM new resource theory. New resource perspective treats organizational behavior from the organization?s creativity, value, especially genetic nature of resource, namely: attention should be paid to intangible resources, and creating intangible resources; focus should be on nurturing scarce and irreplaceable resource, which is valuable; focus should also be self resource genes, which is the organization's own unique, long-term accumulation, the most valuable resource.

Perspective of big organization wants us to focus on the really important things. This is the organization's wisdom.

3.2 Big organization?s concept  Big organization?s concept consists of: the purpose of organization?s structure is innovation; organization?s activities are cantered on flow of information; breaking the traditional organization?s structure; structure that encourage self-running and blurring organization?s boundaries.

What big organization?s concept requires us is having innovation as target, promoting structure that encourage self-running, getting value promotion driven by information flow. Wisdom of organization is embodied here.

3.3 Big organization?s platform  Big organization?s platform is a big organization platform ecosystem. This platform Ecosystem refers to a serious of close organizations form a organic system that is advantages Complementing, resource sharing, value co-creating and core competency upgrading together via a platform, in form of Virtual, coalition etc., and by mechanism of linking ecosystem.

Several terms within big organization platform ecosystem are as follows: Platform ? It is one of many organizations connected to the place or the environment. It can be an     intermediary service organization, a web site, a multilateral market, or even virtual.

Platform ecosystem members ? are including producers, suppliers, competitors and other  stakeholders.

Platform ecosystem composition ? it is composed of a few core enterprises and numerous in-between  enterprises. Core enterprises are the master and cornerstone of the ecosystem. The in-between enterprises are often collaborators and in a subordinate position.

Big organization platform ecosystem is shown in Figure 2.1.

1. Core enterprises build platform 2. In-between enterprises are close to platform 3. Different types of enterprises all survive in platform               Figure 2.1 Big organization platform ecosystem  The operation of big organization platform ecosystem is based on the core business - the system leader taking specific actions to affect the health of the whole ecosystem functioning; establish and maintain a connected ecosystem, including operation mechanism, sharing mechanism, value creation mechanism, through the platform ecosystem leading companies and their partners together to complete.

Big organization platform ecosystem is a revolution. It changes the mode of competition - the future of competition is not competition between individual enterprises, but confrontation from one to another platform ecosystems; more and more assets of enterprises are located outside the boundaries. The success of a single enterprise need to rely on others, rely on the platform ecosystem it is in, namely the development of a business bigly depends on the organization?s ability to connect with the ecosystem.

Big organization platform ecosystem allows us to rely on the power of platform ecosystem, bring our own core competitiveness with other complementary strengths together to create a higher value and achieve co-existence and development. This is the organization's wisdom.

3.4 Big organization?s operation mode Big organization?s operation mode includes:  Core  enterprises  In-between  enterprises Supplier  Produce     Competitor    Other stakeholder    Website  Multilateral     Virtual platform  Gap-oriented  enterprises  Core  enterprise  s  Gap  oriented    Gap  oriented    Gap  oriented       Borderless learning - knowledge flow and information flow lead to learning behavior, learning behavior brings innovation, and intelligent body learns and innovates driven by the flow of information;  Clustering effect - this cluster effect comes from gravity if various enterprises. The gravitational attraction is mainly for the resource, reputation, culture, value, system and personalized authority. Big organization?s gravitational attraction creates big organization.

Big organization?s mode of operation - learning mode without borders and clustering effect. It is how organization learns and innovates through knowledge flow and information flow, and attracts excellent resources and talents into the organization through gravity. This is the organization's wisdom.

3.5 Big organization theory  Big organization theory includes five basic theories: active management theory-leading customers; and culture entropy deduction theory- negative culture entropy; and humanistic ecology theory- inspiring humanity, and circuit theory- a virtuous circle, and collaborative innovation theory- collaborating innovation stakeholders.

All of these five basic theories are based on big organization?s platform? big organization platform ecosystem and its purpose is to let platform ecosystem and organizations inside more powerful.

What the five basic theories of big organization really say is that we should lead customer, inspire humanity, collaborate innovation stakeholders and form a virtuous circle. It?s the intelligence of organization we are talking about.

4 Big organization culture entropy reduction theory Big organization culture entropy reduction theory refers to such situation that the innovative abilities  of enterprise (organization individual or smart body) are enhanced when the entropy flux gained on the Platform Ecosystem of the big organization promotes the increase of negative entropy. Therefore, the culture management of organizational culture system is a process of entropy deduction, which makes it necessary to gain more entropy flux from the Platform ecosystem of big organization to promote the increase of culture negative entropy in organizational culture system.

4.1 The significance of culture entropy change  What cultural entropy of the system revealed is the situation of effective energy in the system. As an open system far from equilibrium , one organization exchanges energy, material and information with the environment constantly, and the cultural entropy of the organization therefore keeps changing continuously, namely, cultural entropy change. The trends of this change will determine the direction of evolution and development of the organization.

The change of cultural entropy includes both positive entropy change (entropy increase) and negative entropy change (entropy decrease). Positive and negative entropy change usually work together in the same system for most situation, and accompany with whole process of the movement in the system.

4.2 Model of culture entropy change     The organizational culture entropy can be displayed in formula 3.1  formula 3.1  Where Q is the energy of various flow; V is corresponding economic value of each flow; R is a space state variable of organization which can be set to a constant; T is time variable of organization for different stages of development.

The culture entropy change caused by in a certain time interval is displayed in formula 3.2  formula 3.2  Where ( )c iE S  is culture entropy generated in culture system of individual  organization; ( )c eE S  is entropy inflow from platform ecosystem. The difference between ( )c iE S  and  ( )c eE S  is the culture entropy change in a certain time interval  When ( ) 0cE S? <  ? entropy inflow is greater than entropy generated within culture system of  individual organization . It indicates that negative entropy of individual organizational culture system is increasing , toward a direction of advanced order and more innovative in a growing-up status.

When ( ) 0cE S? > ? entropy inflow is less than entropy generated within culture system of individual organization. It indicates that positive entropy of individual organizational culture system is increasing , toward a direction of recession in disorder and confusion status.

When ( ) 0cE S? = ? entropy inflow equals to entropy generated within culture system of individual  organization. At this moment, the organization is in a unusual state of equilibrium under which the degree of order may either increase or decrease, and may even perish.

5 Big organization collaborative innovation theory Big organization collaborative innovation theory means coordinating innovative stakeholders. Each organizational individual ? innovation stakeholder in big organization?s platform ecosystem gather innovative resources and elements effectively and realize cooperation at a higher level by breaking through the barriers between the innovation subjects and fully releasing the energy of innovative elements such as talent, capital, information and technology. The realization of collaborative innovation is by mechanisms of recourses sharing, advantages complementation, joint inputs and risk-sharing mechanisms to carry out open collaborative innovation, improve innovation capabilities and innovation efficiency, bring customers benefits and contribute the development of whole industry. That is, taking both social effect and industrial effect into account.  A collaborative innovation model is constructed in this paper.

( ) ( ) ( )c c i c eE S E S E S? = ?  ( , , , )cS f Q V R T=     5.1 Parametric design of collaborative innovation model Parametric is defined as follows? iP  is social effect enterprise i  brings to customers.

iQ  is industrial effect enterprise i  brings to other enterprises by innovation.

ijB is degree of innovation achievement and innovation value sharing between enterprise i  and  enterprise j . If two enterprises is the supply chain relationship, the degree of achievement sharing is  high; if there is no business dealing, the degree of achievement sharing is small, even zero.

ijG is degree of innovative idea and information of new technology sharing between enterprise i and  enterprise j . If the relation between these two enterprises is direct competition, sharing degree of  information ijG  is small; if enterprise i  and enterprise j  are strategic partners, sharing degree of  information ijG   is high.

ij?  is time scale difference of innovation between enterprise i  and enterprise j . ij?  measures how  long it takes enterprise j  to finish the same innovation after enterprise i  finished it. It takes a  development cycle as standard, the range of ij?  is -90< ij? <90.

i?  is the time for enterprise i  to innovate.

iU  is status of enterprise i . The value of iU  is related to industrial efficiency iQ and social efficiency.

iP and is the basis for calculating iP and iQ .

4.2 Collaborative innovation model  Collaborative innovation model is shown in formula 4.1     formula 4.1           Since it is difficult to calculate the direct social effect and industrial effect, a dummy node iU i?  is  set as a benchmark in the complex network to measure the state of the industry. Node iU i?  is the zero     state of innovation stakeholder node PQ . It?s a balanced node. Based on this, we could calculate the  node PQ . Calculation process is: set different innovation stakeholders state iU  and jU . Value of  ij? can be get from innovation time difference. Innovation stakeholders? social effect and industrial  effect can be obtained upon ijB  and ijG set according to relation between innovation stakeholders.

Model 4.1 points out that the value of Gij  directly affects social benefits and sector benefits. Large  Gij  can lead to increasing benefits of the entire industry and the entire social growth. Bij reflects big  organization?s impact on businesses. Only strengthening the inter-agent association within big organization and enhancing the strategic partnership between enterprises can jointly promote the development of the entire industry, and bring more social benefits, so that each agent can be improved.
