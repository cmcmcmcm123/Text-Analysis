Enhanced User Data Privacy with Pay-by-Data Model

Abstract?Personal data collection is becoming pervasive these days, these data has the risk of being abused by current application and application marketplace model, because only the price of application is explicitly indicated without clear agreement on usage of data, and the granularity of data access authentication is not enough to protect users privacy. In this short paper, we propose a new model of user data privacy.

Data usage of the application is explicitly shown, and controlled by an authentication service, to protect users from the abuse of their data, especially in mobile application.

Keywords-User data privacy, Pay by data; application marketplace; mobile privacy.



I.  INTRODUCTION There emerged a large amount of applications, especially  mobile applications, harnessing user-generated data, to deliver values to either users or organizations (or both). To distribute these applications, all major platforms now provide their application marketplaces. Although such model has been proven to be easy for user to find and install application, and helpful to prosper the application development, there still exists some important issues including the one we are targeting in this paper: the risk that the application can collect the user data without letting users know. This problem comes from two aspects:  Firstly, applications are labeled with their price in money, as either free or paid. Actually, lots of applications, which labeled ?free?, consume valuable user data, and even make profit from it. An shown in Figure 1, the application?s behavior of collecting users? data is not explicitly shown, and only could be found in the user agreement, which most users would not pay attention to. Secondly, even in some marketplace, the access of user data by the application is indicated, the granularity of data access authentication is not enough. For example, as shown in Figure 2, although it indicates the application would access the user?s data like location, it doesn?t state how much and how frequently it would collect such data. [3] had demonstrated that with over 4 location records, we can precisely identify a user. Such example shows that the amount of data matters, while collecting a couple of user location records cannot trace the user, collecting more data would cause a violation of user privacy. There is lack of authentication service to solve this problem. In popular authentication protocol like OAuth, only the scope and period of user data access are set.

Figure 1.  Mobile application in App Store      Figure 2.  Data access control in Google Play Store   These two problems drive the work in this paper. We try  to design a new pay-by-data model in which the usage of user-generated data are explicitly indicated, and the access to user?s data is controlled by new authentication service which supports more detailed granularity.



II. RELATED WORK As the user data collection becomes more pervasive, the  privacy issue gets more attention recently. A study from the University of California in Santa Barbara [4] concluded that     among 825 examined apps for the iPhone and its operating system iOS, 21 percent forward the ID number, four percent the current location, and 0.5 percent even copy the address book. Last year, Facebook, Apple, Twitter, Yelp and 14 other companies have been hit with a lawsuit accusing them of distributing privacy-invading mobile applications [5]. And people have heard lots of new about applications abusing users privacy. For example, in February 2012, Path, a mobile social networking service, was widely criticized for uploading contacts from iPhone users without permission [6], and in February 2013, the company was fined $800,000 by the FTC for storing data from underage users and will be required to have its privacy policies assessed every two years for the next 20 years [7].

Facing this issue, some research has been done on investigating and enhancing the privacy mechanism, especially that on mobile and user location privacy. [8] surveyed the privacy issues in location-aware mobile devices.

[9] presented an experimental case study that examined people's concern for location privacy and compared the result to the use of location-based services. [10] tried  to understand users? attitudes and behaviors towards privacy as they interact with mobile applications, and to explore technologies that empower users to more effectively and efficiently specify their privacy preferences. [11] investigated the privacy issue in mobile photo sharing.  [12] proposed an anonymization model to ease the issue of location privacy. [13] discussed the context for mobile privacy through an empirical study of mobile social networking.



III. SYSTEM In this section, we presented our design of pay-by-data  model and its system implementation. The work has four different components: data collection service, data pricing agreement, authentication service, and interface to application and application marketplace. The overall architecture is shown in Figure 3, the data collection component provides an infrastructure where user can store and manage their data in a secure manner. User can view and control all their data, instead of distribute the data in various applications. The data pricing enables the agreement between application and user on how user-generated data would be consumed by the application. The application developer provides the data price while submitting the application to the marketplace. When a user purchases the application, the data price is explicitly shown. Once the agreement is made, the access to the data is controlled by the authentication service; only serving data within the scope and amount in the data pricing agreement. Interface to application and application marketplace provides a way for current application and marketplace to integrate with pay-by- data model.  We would now present these four components in detail.

Figure 3.  Architecture of Pay-by-data model    A. Data Collection Service The data collection service is built upon WikiSensing  platform, a sensor data repository developed by us. Its design is suitable to store and manage user-generated data on a large-scale. The architecture of it is shown in Figure 4. For each type of user data, user registers a data source for it, and can send and retrieve the data in real time. These data are encrypted and secure accessed in WikiSensing. The storage layer is built upon based on mongoDB1 cluster, and it has good performance on scalability. All the data are stored in mongoDB as Json documents without fixed schema. Such schema-less storage architecture decouples the storage layer from the data schema, enabling storage layer flexibility.

To support data management, the data collection component provides ontology support, thus all the data are described by an ontology schema. We adopted a hierarchical category for all the ontology in the system. So the users data could be categorized in namespace like ?location?, ?social network?, etc. Such data structure offers the capability of ontology-based querying over the data, as well as the hierarchical granularity for data access.

Some other functions include the user management, which can be integrated with OpenID service, Web interface for data management, etc.

1 MongoDB: http://mongodb.org      Figure 4.  Architecture of WikiSensing   The functionalities of data collection service are accessed  through authenticated Web services. Figure 5 and 6 shows the Restful Web Service (http and https) for user to register a data source and submit data to it.

Figure 5. API to register user data source     Figure 6.  API to submit data  With this component, user can view and manage all their data sources and data in a centralized and secure manner.

Figure 7 shows the Web interface where user can get the visualized and geo-indexed data created by them.

Figure 7.  Visualization of user data   With such data collection and management service, the  user-generated data are moved from multiple applications without user control, to a centric, independent and user fully controlled place. And we need to mention that, such data collection component is replaceable, users are able to choose any appropriate data storage services to achieve similar functions.

B. Data Pricing Agreement We define a new type of price for applications, which is  the data. As data is valuable for user and application, they could act as a kind of currency, that user pays they for utility gain from the application, as shown in Figure 8. For example, in a crowdsourcing navigation application, users created traffic data is valuable for application to get the overall traffic level, and application?s utility to smart navigation is desired for users. In such case, users can make agreement with the application, to buy the utility of navigation, by paying their travel data.

Figure 8.  From pay by money to pay by data   The price of data is defined as an agreement of data  usage, with the elements listed in Table 1.

TABLE I.  ELEMENT IN DATA PRICING AGREEMENT  Element Description  app_id The identification of application (namespace of marketplace + application identification in the marketplace).

url The url that has the description of the application.

scope The set of scopes where the application consumes the user-generated data, each scope is defined by the data category in data collection service.

frequency The allowed frequency of data access for the application.

amount The maximum amount of data (the number of data records) accessible for the application.

valid_time The valid time for application to access the data  operation The permitted operation on the data by the application, such as read, insert, and update.

When an application is submitted to the application  marketplace, the agreement of data usage is also submitted.

Here is an example of such agreement, in the format of Json:  { ?app_id?: ?ios.1154431?, ?url?: ?http://wikisensing.org/client/appexample?, ?scope?:[?precise-location?], ?frequency?: 21600000, ?amount?: 10, ?valid_time?: 684000000, ?operation?: ?read_only?  } This agreement indicates that an application from iOS  apple store would read users? location data at most 4 times a day, within 10 days, and it can only get 10 location records totally. Such data agreement would be explicitly shown in the marketplace, as shown in the case study section.

If user agrees with it, he can confirm to purchase the application, and the agreement is sent to authentication service for access control.

C. Authentication Service The authentication service acts as a gateway to control  the application access to user?s data in data collection service during the runtime.

The authentication service extends the specification of OAuth 2.0, with additional request parameters of elements including frequency and amount mentioned before. The authentication server is built with oauthlib2.

Figure 9 shows the interaction between user, application, authentication service, and data collection service.

2 oauthlib: https://github.com/idan/oauthlib  Figure 9.  Interaction for authentication   Figure 10 shows the sequential diagram for a data access  by the application if the request is allowed by data pricing agreement:   Figure 10.  Sequential diagram for sucessful data access     Figure 11.  Sequential diagram for illegal data access   When the access of data is out of data pricing agreement,  the data access would be blocked as shown in Figure 11, with error message sent to the application:  HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request Warning: 299 ServiceName "Data agreement error:  access is not allowed with associated data agreement."      D. Interface to Application and Marketplace We provided the interface for both application and  marketplace to adopt the pay-by-data system, as shown in Figure 12.

For application, the interfaces are provided as a set of Web services for the following functions:  ? Getting the data through the authentication service.

? Getting the anonymized identification of user.

? Sending message to data collection service, if user  doesn?t have enough data required.

For marketplace, the interfaces provides following  functionalities: ? Sending user notification about change of data  pricing agreement, and asking user to accept or decline it.

? Getting user?s available categories of data sources.

The application developer don?t need to install new SDK  to enable pay-by-data model, but just change their methods like getting data to interacting with above Web services.

Figure 12.  Interface to application and marketplace   To facilitate the development of application based on  these interfaces, we also provide an online workflow editor ?AppEditor?  which encapsulates these interfaces as the workflow elements, as shown in Figure 13:   Figure 13.  AppEditor   For the application marketplace, more efforts are  required to adopt pay-by-data model: it should provide a new interface for developers to submit their data pricing agreement, and a repository to store them. New user interface for users to view the agreement, and purchase it are also required.



IV. CONCLUSION In this paper, we presented our work on enhancing data  privacy for user in pervasive data collection era, by proposing a pay-by-data model and system, where the data price is explicitly shown and authentication has more detailed granularity. We showed the design and implementation of four core components in the system. We believe our work provides a new approach to protect users? privacy, especially while for the application from application marketplace.
