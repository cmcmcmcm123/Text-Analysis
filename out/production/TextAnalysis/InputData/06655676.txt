The implemented archi- tecture integrates cloud enabled big data analytics capabilities, networked BCI (Brain Computer Interface) devices, and Decision Making Engine. The novel CEB technology comprises of 1.

Cloud-enabled BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) headsets, which is developed and networked in a cloud to enable rapid decision making and 2. Genetic algorithm based decision making engine, to intelligently assist the users in decision making; Advantage of our architecture is that when CEB loads the data, it will automatically recommend the best applicable Machine Learning (ML) algorithms after being evaluated to solve a given problem.

Hence, with such automated machine learning techniques, CEB users workload is significantly reduced. Our experiments on DARPA dataset indicate that CEB technologies performed 10 times faster and about 4 times less false negative rate than current computational methods in seeking and understanding information. Our results demonstrate that these CEB technolo- gies would enable humans to accurately and quickly detect meaningful information from a mass amount of data. The novel CEB technologies ensure that the reduced manpower does not result in reduced performance.

I. INTRODUCTION  Computers can process vast amounts of data in a short time but programming them to detect patterns is extremely difficult.

Humans, on the other hand, are adept at extracting patterns from large amounts of data, yet are limited by the rate at which they can apply these cognitive abilities to large amounts of quickly changing information [1]. Consequently, computers have low success rates when tasked with detecting relevant and important information embedded in complex data streams, while humans are unable to effectively process large amounts of data that are fast becoming a hallmark of todays decision- making environments. Compounding the problem, traditional support technologies, like decision aids and visualization tools, create an artificial barrier which plays to either the strengths of computers or the strengths of their human operators, but not both.

This problem could be addressed by imparting human intu- itive skills to the computers. Intuition is the process through which humans quickly make sense of partial, incomplete,  or rapidly presented information. Intuitive decision-making processes are associated with rapid recognition of patterns among incoming streams of information followed by retrieval of associated knowledge without conscious attention [2]. The neural processes underlying intuition occur on a very rapid timescale and can be captured by non-invasive imaging tech- nologies. In parallel to the non-invasive imaging technologies discoveries, advances in bio-inspired adaptive data analysis techniques like genetic algorithmic modeling are now being used to filter and sort information that is presented to humans.

To achieve this, first ?hunches?, are generated around likely human responses. Then human behavioral responses are used to establish the plausibility of such hunches. Finally the refined information is being presented through multiple iterations of this process. Also it should be possible to augment the support of these bio-inspired data processing techniques by integrating into them with the neuro-cognitive measures of intuition.

Combined with cognitive and behavior-based measures of intu- ition, neural measures should provide significant improvement in measurement accuracy [2]. This would enable humans to accurately and quickly detect meaningful information from a mass of data.

In this paper we present the technologies for intuitive decision making to augment the current data processing tech- niques. This will enable humans to rapidly analyze large amounts of information in complex information environments.

We have demonstrated that higher the amount of information processed per unit time, lesser is the overall decision-making time.

In Section II, we have discussed the related work that is ongoing in this area. In Section III, we have explained our Cloud Enabled Brain Computer Interface Architecture (CEB- CIA) and the decision making engine. Section IV discusses our preliminary experimental results. In Section V, we present our conclusion and our future direction.



II. RELATED WORK  In recent years, a number of data mining algorithms and knowledge discovery technologies have been developed and applied for finding information from the ever-growing vari- ous data sources such as structured, unstructured, relational, temporal-geospatial datasets, etc., Hadoop [10] and Cloud Map Reduce [11] have been the leading parallel and distributed computing technologies that are used in wide variety of  2013 IEEE Ninth World Congress on Services  DOI 10.1109/SERVICES.2013.11   2013 IEEE Ninth World Congress on Services  DOI 10.1109/SERVICES.2013.11     applications and domains. However, these existing technolo- gies lack with respect to autonomic intelligent information processing operations across multiple modalities of the data [3] - [7].

State-of-the-art MapReduce computing algorithm is imple- mented on parallel and distributed real time Hadoop or Storm [12] computing platform, which is used to support search engines, recommendation engines and big data analytics in wide variety of applications. However, Hadoop-MapReduce technologies alone are inadequate to perform autonomous data discovery and analysis operations across various data sources (e.g. Department of Defense Global Information Grid, Human Intelligence Collection, Open Source Intelligence Collection etc.) and data types (e.g. text, video, audio, images, etc.).

This is due to the reason that they are incapable of seeking, understanding and presenting information and moreover both Map and Reduce functions are implemented on fixed nodes.

Cloud computing technologies have been used for analyzing electroencephalograms (EEG) using neural networks [12]. The performance of the EEG processing on the cloud is much better than these most approaches using single EEG device- single user. For instance, 150 users use the cluster of 10 machines; 1GB of EEG signals is processed every 83 seconds, and over 1TB of data is processed in a day [12]. However, current cloud approaches has the following limitations:  1) They not designed to improve human decision making techniques.

2) They need to speed up to process 1TB data in less than 1 hour (over 24 times faster than current speed).

Currently, the BCI technologies are in early experimental stage. Potential targets are identified by the BCI-human system based on the data fusion from the analyst?s brain responses and button clicks, when the images are presented to the analyst with a rate of around 3 to 10 images per second [3]. In order for the BCI technologies to solve real world problems, the following new capabilities are needed.

1) Efficient computing infrastructures such as cloud com- puting, to enable real time analysis and big data analyt- ics.

2) Mathematically and biologically precise models of hu- man brain functions, in order to capture and reuse human brain capabilities such as rapid decision making skills, learning, and reasoning.

3) Better, reliable, economical and practical BCI devices in order to quickly and precisely capture and use human conscious mind, ideas, and neuro-cognitive measures via cross cortical waves and coherences, cognitive indica- tors, etc. for individuals and teams of humans.

To address these limitations, our objective is to create a real time Big Data Analytics tools by synergistically integrating our innovative Intelligent Agents with real time Hadoop frame- work, streaming data processing tools, and proven machine learning algorithms (ML). We have utilized the open source Mahout, Rapid Miner, and Weka for the machine learning algorithms, and leveraged the proven source codes of our  intelligent agents [8] and Blackboard pattern enabled agents [9].

We also participated in the Department of Defense (DoD) Neuro-technology for Intelligence Analysts (NIA) program to accelerate Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) analysis [9]. The vision for DoD?s NIA program is to revolutionize how an- alysts handle intelligence imagery, increasing throughput of imagery to an analyst and overall accuracy of assessments.

NIA seeks to identify robust brain signals that can be recorded in an operational environment and process these in real-time to select images that merit further review. Investigations of visual neuroscience mechanisms indicate that human brains are capable of responding visually much more quickly than they respond physically. Successful development of a neuro- biologically based image triage system can increase speed and accuracy of image analysis where the number of acquired images is expected to rise significantly.



III. DISCUSSION OF THE ARCHITECTURE AND TECHNOLOGIES  A. Cloud Enabled Brain Computer Interface Architecture  Our CEB architecture consists of 1) Wireless BCI headset devices, 2) A novel cloud computing infrastructure capable of pro-  cessing real-time data streams, 3) A novel Decision Making Engine based on ML tech-  nologies and 4) Algorithm Selection Optimizer, to support a large num-  ber of concurrent users.

As shown in Figure 1, our Cloud Enabled Brain Computer Interface Architecture is designed by creating and integrat- ing cloud computing technologies, Brain Computer Interface (BCI) headset systems, and Decision Making Engine. By moving the analyses of BCI-human data to the cloud, our CEB architecture can avoid the limitations of existing mobile BCI applications. Instead of having a single computer dedicated to a single user, the CEB users can have a private cloud of clusters or computers serving many users. This approach has the following benefits over existing methods:  1) By aggregating various datasets and users BCI headset signals, CEB users can have much larger datasets that can be used in the machine learning (ML) algorithm libraries.

2) A CEB user can leverage a group of experts and multiple ML algorithms that are spread across a cloud. This would enable users to work together for a collective decision and thereby avoiding biases, human errors, or knowledge gaps of a single user.

3) Through more complex analysis with the Cloud MapRe- duce paradigm, streams from the Electroencephalogra- phy (EEG) to the BCI headset devices can be analyzed over both immediate and longer intervals of data with respect to trends, patterns and knowledge sets.

The protocol that an user need to comply with our CEB tools to solve a specific problem are as follows:     Fig. 1. Cloud Enabled Brain Computer Interface -Human System Architec- ture  Step 1 : CEB tools are automatically configured and cali- brated after the data and problem are entered into the tools;  Step 2 : New users are trained to effectively apply the CEB system; CEB users can be trained anywhere and anytime via mobile devices (iPhones, etc.), wired and wireless computers.

Step 3 : CEB technologies are used to speed up human decision making and automatically provide effective human machine interaction, rapid data-processing ca- pabilities, and information discovering, while facing big data sources and streaming datasets (such as BCI signals, etc.)  Step 4 : CEB integrated cloud-enabled BCI headset systems and ML tools are improved by utilizing feedbacks from users.

B. Cloud Enabled BCI Devices  In order to make our CEB BCI headset devices to have the new capabilities, as indicated in Section 2, we have in- vestigated current existing Commercial Of The Shelf (COTS) and open source tools. We have developed the state-of-the art BCI technologies and devices as shown in Figure 2.

To enhance CEB BCI devices, we have introduced human intuition measures (e.g., cognitive, behavioral, and neural markers) and neuro-cognitive measures such as emotional EEG, Electromyogram (EMG), Electro-Oculogram (EOG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG). This would further improve human real time decision making by use of brain-derived cognitive indicators and neuro-cognitive measures of intuition.

Per our literature review, following are the benefits of using CEB cloud enabled BCI devices and technologies:  1) Low cost, portability, wireless, ease of use, and many users using mobile devices and computers (wired and/or wireless networked commodity computers).

2) Simplified process of executing experiments, anywhere, anytime, and virtually any number of users via wired or wireless networks.

3) Real time data processing, expedited experimental de- sign, fast development and deployment processes, easy and quick training.

4) Much better decision making due to the use of all users skills, expertise and knowledge via cloud-enabled BCI- EEG headset systems and machine learning technologies  and 5) Faster information throughput in processing large data  sets by using cloud parallel computing and massive ML technologies via Mahout, SciPy, R, SAS and others.

We have tested widely used COTS and open source EEG headsets including Emotiv EPOC headsets, NeuroSky Mind- Wave, MindSet, Mindflex, and XWave headsets [14, 16, 17] for the BCI performance. Using do-it-yourself tools like NeuroSky, developers can make the EEG headsets work with mobile phones. As per our survey, the Emotiv Epoc delivers far more accurate information, drive brainwave entrainment sessions, and adjust the frequency of a session to the most dominant brainwave within a set range instantly in real time.

Candidate EEG headsets can be further developed into our cloud-enabled CEB BCI devices, which can be integrated with CEB Cloud Hadoop, Mahout and Storm.

As indicated in Section 2, the current BCIs have many prob- lems such as exorbitant costs, inaccuracies, invasive surgeries and delays between thought, detection, and action. The Emotiv system can be improved as a cost-effective gateway to non- invasive portable EEG measurements. This would result in building a thought-based BCI system as shown in Figure 2, to measure human intuitions and decision making indicators.

Our vision is that the CEB BCI will be a revolutionary new personal interface for human computer interaction, with a high resolution, capable of neuro-signal acquisition and the processing wireless neuro-headset, which could be weared directly without any conductive gels or liquids.

Cognitiv suite monitors within Emotiv EEG System in- terpret the user?s conscious thoughts. Each brainwave EEG system primarily consists of a headset, electrodes and Soft- ware Development Kit (SDK). It can measure over 12 active thoughts including push, pull, lift, drop, disappear, and passive neutral state. The Emotiv Software detects these thoughts using built-in proprietary software. The Cognitiv suite distin- guishes the differences between four separate thoughts on-the- fly. However, the user can recognize additional thoughts con- currently by having multiple Control Panels open simultane- ously, each looking for different thoughts. Emotiv is currently considering enhancing the concurrent thought recognition limit to beyond four different thoughts. Emotiv offers Software De- velopment Kits (SDK), which grant various control to the user  Fig. 2. BCI Headset Devices Enabled by Cloud Computing and ML Technologies in the CEB System     Fig. 3. An application case using the Emotiv tools  over the EPOC headset API and detection libraries as shown in Figure 3. One of the research edition of the SDK, includes the Emotiv Control Panel, EmoComposer (an emulator for simulating EEG signals), EmoKey (a tool for mapping various events detected by the headset into keystrokes), the TestBench, and an upgraded Application Programming Interface (API).

These features enable the capture of raw EEG data from each individual sensor. EEG data can be very noisy, which makes classifying it correspondingly difficult. However, Emotiv filters out frequencies between 50 and 60Hz in an attempt to improve the signal quality. A number of machine learning algorithms are built in Emotiv tool where the users can configure given parameters for their BCI experiments.

The following are the key algorithms built in the Emotiv devices:  1) K-nearest neighbor algorithm: The configurable param- eters of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm include a) K: the number of nearest neighbors used in the voting process; and b) WeightedVoting: a Boolean value which determines whether or not all votes are weighted by the voters Euclidian distance to the test example.

2) Voted Perceptron algorithm: The configurable param- eters of the voted perceptron algorithm include: a) Epochs: the number of iterations performed over the training set; and b) Kernel: the kernel function used by the algorithm.

These parameters such as K and Kernel will be automati- cally configured by our CEB BCI devices. CEB BCI headsets can be further developed to meet the users needs by (1) em- powering collective intelligence via our novel cloud computing infrastructure and (2) adding ML capabilities to quickly mine actionable information from big raw data sources. Our cloud enabled BCI devices are expected to increase the detection speed and accuracy precision in target detection compared to the existing approaches.

The wireless BCI-EEG headsets can be applied to many areas. For instance, the following cases illustrate their practical usages or applications:  Case 1: The idea of a directed selection of a desirable action  or object can be motivated by internal likes, dislikes and preferences. Such internal processes are in the domain of our human physiology. Understanding the physiological processes of decision making across a variety of contexts is an essential aim in decision science. BCI devices have a great potential to further progress in the decision sciences research. The nature of decision making is explored by examining the associated brain activity, EEG signals of people to understand how the brain responds while undertaking choices designed to elicit the subjects preferences.

Our networked wireless EEG devices can greatly help understand such human decision making pro- cess. CEB technologies can improve human decision making skills while dealing with time critical mili- tary or business mission tasks involving huge and complex data sets.

Case 2: BCI-EEG headsets have become widely used in consumer BCI applications. Thus, these BCI devices allow one to conducting large-scale EEG experiments via Internet or Cloud. Experiments with Emotiv EPOC (EPOC) headsets have indicated that the clas- sification accuracy significantly exceeded the level of random classification. The control experiment has shown that utilization of high-quality research equipment can enhance classification accuracy (up to 68%) and that the accuracy is independent of the presence of EEG artifacts related to blinking and eye movement [15]. As against the more sophis- ticated multi-class common spatial patterns classi- fier, computationally-inexpensive Bayesian classifier based on covariance matrix analysis yields similar classification accuracy. CEB can test and select the best ones from many ML algorithms including Ma- hout libraries for the purpose of clustering, classifi- cation and collaborative filtering. The best ML algo- rithms can be applied to effectively solve problems in decision making and human training. Using CEB BCI headset devices, near real time flickers the users brain wave patterns can be detected, whenever the user is given a target feature. The target feature could be a hidden military facility, a tank and a vehicle in one of the briefly flashed images.

Case 3: To develop high-throughput imagery triage applica- tion, a BCI system cortically blends computer visions with human robust recognition capabilities. The BCI system uses a noninvasive brain-computer interface, to intercept signatures of recognition events. The vi- sual processor performs perception and recognition, while the EEG interface detects the result or decision of that processing. The goal of the BCI headset system is to detect neural activity associated with perceptual and/or cognitive events. Detecting such events i.e., a physical target, a high value individual or soft target, implies the detection of when an event has occurred and identifying its significance.

Fig. 4. Cloud Computing and ML Modules Supporting BCI Devices in the CEB Technologies  Recent advances in high-spatial density EEG, real- time signal processing, machine learning and human- computer interface have enabled these neuroscience findings to be used in the development of BCI systems. These advances in BCI systems have been proven effective to support high throughput image triage. The correlated spatio-temporal structures in videos could be identified similarly by humans with the improved BCI devices or headsets.

Experimentation on several BCI devices have demonstrated that  1) Use of human brain signals via the BCI headset systems can help analysts to increase the search throughput and support rapid target detection;  2) Over six times increase in search throughput (Sq.

KM/min) has been achieved across multiple image ana- lysts and target types; and  3) Target detection rate at the rate of 5 to 10 targets per second of imagery chips has been reached by viewing rapid presentation of the stream images.

C. CEB Cloud Computing Ecosystem  We have developed the CEB approach to improve human information throughput and rapid decision making. Our CEB cloud computing ecosystem is illustrated in Figure 4. In our ecosystem, archived datasets from databases and file systems are processed by Hadoop and Map- Reduce. For instance, images or videos are read into the CEB and the images are presented to the analysts. Analysts can then select targets at the rate of 2 to 5 seconds per target and their BCI devices also send the mobile EEG signals into the CEB. The CEB can also detect targets of interest at much higher speed at the rate of about 1 target per100 milliseconds compared to human beings. Real time streaming datasets are being processed by Storm and Cloud MapReduce. For instance, live image and/or video streams from the satellite downlinks can be fed into the CEB system.

To effectively process the real time streaming data sets, Storm is integrated in the CEB system as illustrated in Figures  2, and 4. Storm is an open source distributed real time computation system [12]. In addition, Storm has many capabil- ities: real time analytics, online machine learning, continuous computation, distributed remote procedure calls, ETL, and more. Storm is also extremely fast with over a million Tuples processed per second per node. It is scalable, fault-tolerant, guarantees that the input data can be processed, and is easy to set up and operate.

As shown in the Figure 4, data streams consist of many Tuples: Spouts read from Kestrel queue, streaming APIs, Web Logs, API calls and Event data; Bolts process these input streams and create new streams. Bolts provide functions, filters, aggregation, joins and database access. Topologies are networks or directed graphs of Spouts and Bolts. As shown in Figure 4, Storm cluster is integrated into the CEB system, which is composed of a master node and worker nodes. The master node runs a daemon Nimbus which is responsible for distributing code, assigning tasks, and checking for failures.

Each worker node runs a daemon Supervisor which listens for work and starts and stops worker processes. Nimbus and Supervisor daemons are fail-fast and stateless, which makes them robust. Coordination between the daemons are handled by Apache ZooKeeper in the CEB cloud. A code segment of the CEB Storm is shown in Listing 1 to count streaming words.

We have developed a novel cloud infrastructure architecture for big data analytics. We have leveraged and improved the cloud ecosystem using Mahout ML libraries and HBase. This enables the cloud based BCI-EEG devices smarter and faster.

HBase in CEB provides a scalable, distributed database, that supports structured data storage for large tables. Rationale for utilizing HBase in CEB as it needs a random, real-time read and write access to process huge amount of data. HBase will be built in the CEB with the following technical components: a) Convenient base classes for backing Hadoop MapReduce jobs and functions with HBase tables. b) Query predicate push down via server side scan and get filters, that will select related data for track management systems.

Listing.1. A Code Segment in Storm to Count words in a Data Stream ...

TopologyBuilder builder = new TopologyBuilder(); Builder.setSpout(sentences, new RandomSentenceSpout(), 5); Builder.setBolt(split, new SplitSentence(), 8).shuffleGroup- ing(sentences); Builder.setBolt(count, new WordCount(), 12).fieldGroup- ing(split, new Field(word)); ...

Cloud Map Reduce cluster, Storm, and Mahout ML libraries used in the CEB will be much faster than using traditional technologies such as R package, because the former has been proven by their performance in varied applications [11-13, 5].

Fig. 5. The Decision Making Engine will improve human decision making  D. Innovative Decision Making Engine  As shown in Figure 4, Algorithm Selection Optimizer is designed and developed to make CEB tools smarter and better. This is achieved by automatically selecting optimal algorithms for CEB users, after the data and tasks are entered into the CEB. Specifically, this Algorithm Selection Optimizer is based on our cognitive genetic algorithm and collective feedback and intelligence. Our cognitive genetic algorithm (its code segment is listed in Listing 2) in Algorithm Selection Optimizer is used to implement the collective feedback and intelligence. The following steps in Figure 5 explain how the cognitive genetic algorithm in the Decision Making Engine can help CEB users to improve their decision making speed and accuracy in effectively processing and analyzing ever-growing huge datasets and data streams.

Listing 2. Genetic Algorithm Code Segment in CEB Decision Making Engine ...

public GA() rand = new Random(); for (int i = 0; i ? populationSize; i++) Candidate c = new Candidate(); c.random(); population.add(c); Collections.sort(population); // sorting method System.out.println(?Init population sorted?); print(); ...

How to make optimal use of cognitive feedbacks in a computer-human system is one of the key problem areas that our work tries to solve. In a critical decision making process, two or more decision makers and their feedbacks, as shown in Figure 5 are required to ensure the objectives of decision process. In case of the huge data sources and fast data streams, cloud enabled CEB tools blend rapid data processing capabilities of the cloud with intuitive decision making skills of humans to improve human information throughput and decision making quality. Our CEB tools including Decision Making Engine enable the decision makers to have collective cognitive feedbacks and thinking through the wireless BCI  devices and cloud computing power. Subjective errors, biases, and other decision mistakes of individual humans can be eliminated by such collective, collaborative and cloud enabled CEB systems.

Technically, the Algorithm Selection Optimizer can use a knowledge base to manage what ML algorithms exist in the CEB, best solvable problems or tasks that the users provide, requirements on the input data such as data types and data quality. The following are examples of the CEB machine learning (ML) algorithms that can be applied to two areas:  Classification: predicting a category, e.g., discrete, finite values with no ordering; Regression: predicting a numeric quantity, e.g., continuous, infinite values with ordering.

These applicable areas (1) and (2) above can be solved by these 10 ML algorithms: Linear regression, Logistic re- gression, Linear and Logistic regression with regularization, Neural networks, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Near- est Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Trees. Importantly, this Algorithm Selection Opti- mizer can be automatically updated whenever a new algorithm is successfully applied to a known problem area (e.g., classi- fication, prediction, etc.). Therefore, the more ML algorithms CEB tools have, the more useful they become to solve new problems including various problems in rapid decision making in military and commercial applications.



IV. EXPERIMENTATION AND RESULTS  One of the key components in our CEB approach is the Blackboard patterns. We have designed and tested the Black- board patterns for opportunistic reasoning and associative memory. In our experiments, Blackboard pattern enabled in- telligent agents that have successfully identified the insurgents using the HUMINT and OSINT datasets [9]. These agents have successfully detected the high value individuals or soft targets by automatically searching, analyzing and quantifying the multi-INT data. Specifically, for one of the military use case, the intelligent agents has effectively identified the ad- versary leaders from groups of people based on the collected real-world data, and one screenshot is shown in Figure 6.

Reusing the source code bases from our proven intelli- gent agents [8] and Blackboard pattern enabled agents [9], mobile CEB Agents were developed to automate tasks of seeking, understanding and presenting information. Their ma- chine learning capabilities were enabled by using open source Rapid Miner and open source Mahout and Weka for scalable and cloud computing environment. Mobility of CEB Agents  Fig. 6. The insurgents are identified by our Blackboard pattern hosted agents     were implemented as mobile Mappers and Reducers by using unanchored and/or mobile objects in socket programming and object serialization. Thus, machine learning algorithms em- powered by mobile Map Reduce functions were implemented in Hadoop clusters to enable advanced computational intel- ligence and scalable computing algorithms. Our preliminary experiments demonstrates that CEB technologies performs about 10 times faster and about 4 times less false negative rate and positive rate compared to current computational methods in seeking and understanding information. This is due to the following reasons: (a) Utilizing mobile MapReduce functions enables end-to-end parallelism of data processing and analytics; and (b) Using our mobile Agents based parallel analytics, CEB tools enhance data seeking (where and what), information understanding (analysis, association, reasoning, etc.) in parallel and intuitively present the actionable informa- tion to the users. Additionally, CEB Agents are also observed to have the following capabilities:  1) Providing mobile scalable MapReduce analytics and ensuring execution results  2) Performing the data fusion by summarizing the discov- ered information for the users  3) Generating recommendations on multiple level of details for the users  In order to speed up information discovery, we have built indexes such as inverted index, linking commonly searched frames to document IDs. These indexes are utilized by CEB Agents to construct links (file paths, web URLs, etc.) for original document retrieval and further data mining and fusion such as confidence ranking based observation summaries.

After executing the Map functions, the mobile Agents execute the Reduce functions and cache most recent results for faster responses. When the current host has minimal computing resources, the Agents proactively construct Map Reduce func- tions and execute them in anticipation of large service requests.



V. CONCLUSION  Our CEB architecture and technologies will benefit gov- ernment, military, industrial, and business applications, where high quality decision making capabilities are required. We plan to further improve the CEB architecture, ML development and technology integration through the feedbacks from analysts, and trainees. Thus the CEB could benefit the user community by leveraging the advanced cloud computing technologies and the best human intuitive decision making skills across various fields. To demonstrate the feasibility of our innovative CEB approach, we are planning to conduct the future experiments to verify its feasibility, capabilities, and functionalities in improving human information throughput and rapid decision making. Performance assessment of the CEB prototype can be conducted to investigate by what extent the CEB technologies will greatly increase decision making speed and precision, as well as scalability for the applications it can support.
