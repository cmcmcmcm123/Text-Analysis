Knowledge management and data mining for supply  chain risk management

Abstract- Supply chain Management is increasingly challenging in today's competitive world. The greater the uncertainties in supply and demand, globalization of the market in complex international supply network relationships have led to higher exposure to risks in the supply chain. In this paper, we develop a framework of knowledge-based supply chain risk management system which includes four modules: basic database, knowledge database management, supply chain risk early warning and risk management strategies module. We analyze the basis process of knowledge-based supply chain risk management which includes four steps: knowledge collection, knowledge discovery, knowledge share and knowledge study.At last, we define three simple association rules application to supply chain risk management.

I. INTRODUCTION  Today's modern, industrialized society is based on globalization, specialization and mass-production. It is a society dependent upon highly integrated supply chain flows.

Disruptions in those flows may cause devastating negative consequences, both for the individual company, for the supply chain, and for the society at large.

Supply chain has cross-boundary and multi-aspect features which always includes multi-suppliers and multi-distributors.

So supply chain vulnerable to the external environment and internal enterprises and come into being supply chain risk. In February and June 2008, Chinese steel enterprises had accepted Companhia Vale do Rio Doce and Rio Tinto Australian company two suppliers of iron ore price, its price up to 71% and 96.5%.By October 2008, with steel prices and iron ore prices fall, China's domestic iron and steel enterprises suffered enormous losses, the overall loss of about 25 billion yuan. The majority of enterprises were difficult to reverse the losses in next two years. The same happened all over the world in 2008.Such as automobile manufacturing, electronics manufacturing, toys and clothing export processing, these enterprises increased production capacity too fast and neglect market risk. In result, many companies were bankrupt and a large number of workers losing their jobs.

In 2003,The United States investigation and consulting firm Gartner Group had predicted that 1/5 of the enterprises would be subject to some kinds of supply chain disruption, and more than 60 percent enterprises would be quit their industries[1].The empirical research of Hendricks & Singhal  (2003[2],2005[3]) also fully reflected that the risk factors of the supply chain had significant effect on the wealth of the company. Based on 519 samples of data from 1989 to 2000, they found that the isturbance of the supply chain would make the company wealth declined 10.28%. They also based on 827 sample data from 1989 to 2000 estimates of supply chain disturbance for long-term effects of company wealth. The research found that supply chain sudden risk would make the normal average earnings decrease of 33%~40%.



II. LITERATURE REVIEW  A. supply chain risk management  There exists no generally agreed definition of supply chain risk management. Supply chain risk management may be regarded as a collaborative and structured approach to risk management, included in the planning and control processes of the supply chain, to handle risks which might affect the achievement of the supply chain goals[4]. Paulsson?2004?have developed the concept of supply chain risk management ? SCRM? and thought that ?Supply chain risk management is to, collaboratively with partners in a supply chain or on your own, apply risk management process tools to deal with risks and uncertainties caused by, or impacting on, logistics related activities or resources in the supply chain?[5].Yan-ju Zhou(2006) [6]summarized the major literatures that focus on risk identification, risk assessment and risk management process in supply chain. Furthermore, the author proposed the future research directions on supply chain risk management, such as risk identification on supply chain network, quantitative risk assessment, risk management process with feedback mechanism under dynamic circum stance. There are also several scholars conduct empirical research on supply chain risk management, mainly include Hendricks & Singhal ?2003?2005?and Kleindorfer & Saad?2005?[7].They mainly used some normal data released by market research in the supply chain risks and uncertainties affect the Company's effective. Fisher(2007)[8] examined the enterprise risks from the perspective of the whole supply chain and propose some methods to control procurement risk to Intel Corporation as an example. About supply chain risk quantitative research, research methods used are mainly financial option theory, game theory, dynamic ordering and inventory model, Markov decision-making methods, case-based reasoning methods.

B. Knowledge-based supply chain management  In support of the Government of the United Kingdom, Hall (1998) carried out a major research projects, "the strategic partnership and the Knowledge Management Planning on the basis of the ability elevation", analyzed the hidden resources (including knowledge resources) impact on supply chain[9].Subsequently, Crone (2001) studied supply chain knowledge transfer and dissemination of the multi-national corporations in Northern Ireland, analyzed the cause of barriers to knowledge transfer leading, put forward a multi-national corporations achieve the supply chain knowledge transfer measures[10].Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan set up a knowledge-sharing mechanism in its global supply chain, with their suppliers and customers to share explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge resources, and had achieved success in practice[11].Presently supply chain knowledge management research focused mainly in the following areas: the basic theory of knowledge management, knowledge types, knowledge learning, knowledge sharing and transfer in supply chain; knowledge absorptive capacity of supply chain enterprises, supply chain knowledge management implementation, relationships of supply chain knowledge management and supply chain performance[12].

C. The paper?s research focus  From above, supply chain knowledge management research focuses on the study of knowledge dissemination and sharing of models and their implications for the importance of supply chain performance. Research is rare on how to dig up chain enterprises knowledge and information to decrease risk of supply chain. Therefore, the paper focus knowledge management theories and data mining methods apply to supply chain risk management and set up framework of knowledge-based supply chain risk management system.



III. KNOWLEDGE-BASED SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT  A. Framework of knowledge-based supply chain risk management system The point of studying knowledge management of supply  chain risk management system is to respond to the rapid change of the market environment and to avoid predictable problems in the supply chain. The object is to improve ability of supply chain risk management while discovering and learning continuously.

Knowledge-based supply chain risk management system Mainly includes the following four modules:1) Basic database module; 2) Knowledge database Management Module; 3)Supply Chain Risk Early Warning Module; 4)Risk Management Strategies Module. The basic framework of knowledge-based supply chain risk management system shown in Figure 1.

1) Basic database module. Basic database includes all kinds of enterprises information,documents,case. For example, inventory information, the fluctuation of price in market, etc.

2) Knowledge database Management Module. This part mainly includes indicators base, model base, case base and  experts base, includes early-warning indicators, models, early warning knowledge, used to store the various cases of early warning plans.

3) Supply Chain Risk Early Warning Module.We put supply chain risks into two categories: the general risks and the sudden risks. The general risks which are characterized by high probability,little harm and easy to control. The sudden risks which are characterized by low probability,great harm and difficult to control. The fundamental reasons for general risks are uncertainty of customer demand and imbalance of supply and demand in supply chain certain aspect. The fundamental reasons for sudden risks are unpredictable sudden events.For the general risks, in accordance with the information collection and screening, risk indicators identifying, risk forecasting, thresholds for alarm identifying and alarm mechanisms to carry out the supply chain risk management.For the sudeen risks, make the risks into further classification, analysis the impact through empirical research and software scenarios simulation, and then set up the general response mechanism.

4) Risk Management Strategies Module. The risk management system will generate risk assessment report and put forward several feasible strategies.

Figure 1 The basic framework of knowledge-based supply chain risk  management system  B. Process of knowledge-based supply chain risk management  Generally speaking, the process of knowledge-based supply chain risk management includes knowledge collection, knowledge discovery, knowledge share and knowledge study.

First, the collection of knowledge means that data and information of supply chain is collected by technology such as  Knowledge database Management  Indicators Base Management  Experts Base Management  Model Base Management Case Base Management  Risk Management Strategies  Basic database  Information Documents Cases  Supply Chain Risk Early Warning  Indicator System  Risk forecasting alarm mechanisms  general risks sudden risks  Case-based reasoning  software scenarios simulation    agent or database, for example, inventory information, the fluctuation of price in market, etc. This step provides the foundation resources for the later steps.

Second,the discovery of knowledge means that knowledge is extracted from a large amount of information. OLAP, data mining, and case-based reasoning are used to dig out knowledge. In this step, the information collected form former step is translated into knowledge. For instance, it needs to start the response mechanism when the fluctuation of price exceeds the warning line. In this example, what is the warning line?s level and how the repsonse mechanism operates all belong to the category of knowledge, and all the knowledge need to be analyzed with specific tools.

Third,the share of knowledge implies that knowledge is spread to the nodes in the supply chain. Not only must the network spread the knowledge rapidly, but also public and friendly atmosphere in the network are essential. The Notes based on network is a software which can provide the approach of sharing knowledge and improving the working efficiency between supply chains. In this step, the share of knowledge is dominated by the core enterprise. A good example is the well-known case of Toyota and its supply chain, that Toyota played a core role in its supply chain.

Fourth,The study of knowledge is the purpose why the knowledge Management is studied. It is also a necessary condition that knowledge increases in value. This step is crucial for the enterprise to keep its competitive advantage.

Special topic discussion and on-line studies are viable approaches towards studying of knowledge.



IV. ASSOCIATION RULE MINING IN SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT  A. Data mining and Association Rule Mining  Data mining (sometimes called data or knowledge discovery) is the process of analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into useful information, which can be used to increase revenue, cut costs, or both. Data mining software is one of a number of analytical tools for analyzing data. It allows users to analyze data from many different dimensions or angles, categorize it, and summarize the relationships identified. Technically, data mining is the process of finding correlations or patterns among dozens of fields in large relational database. For example, one Midwest grocery chain used the data mining capacity of Oracle software to analyze local buying patterns. They discovered that when men bought diapers on Thursdays and Saturdays, they also tended to buy beer. Further analysis showed that these shoppers typically did their weekly grocery shopping on Saturdays. On Thursdays, however, they only bought a few items. The retailer concluded that they purchased beer to have it available for the upcoming weekend. The grocery chain could use this newly discovered information in various ways to increase revenue. For example, they could move the beer display closer to the diaper display. And, they could make sure beer and diapers were sold at full price on Thursdays.

While large-scale information technology has been evolving separate transaction and analytical systems, data mining provides the link between the two. Association rule mining is one of the analytical data mining software. The goal of the techniques described is to detect relationships or associations between specific values of categorical variables in large data sets. This is a common task in many data mining projects as well as in the data mining subcategory text mining.

B. Simple Association Rule in supply chain risk management  Association rule mining finds interesting associations and correlation relationships among large set of data items.

Association rules show attribute value conditions that occur frequently together in a given dataset. Through describing hiding rules between items in the database, we can find out some meaningful rules with high support and confidence. The following three definitions are related to association rule:  Definition 1:Let { }miiiI ,,, 21=  be a set of m distinct default partners attributes. Let D  be a database, where each record represents an item of several attribute values of default partner who has a unique identifier. An association rule is an implication of the form YX ? , where IYX ?, , are sets of attributes called databases, and ?=?YX . Hence, X  is called antecedent, and Y  consequent.

Moreover, two important measures for association rules, support and confidence, can be defined as follows.

Definition 2: The ( )YX ?support  of an association rule YX ? is the ratio of the attributes that contain YX ?  to the  total number of attributes in the database.

Thus if we say that the support of a rule is 10%, then it means that 10% of the total default partners contain YX ? . Support is the statistical significance of an association rule. Supply chain decision makers and practitioners probably would not be concerned about how default attributes like profitability and location are related if less than 10% of given attributes have this combination to model its impact on default.. While a high support is desirable for association rules, this is not always the case. For example, if we were using association rules to predict the failure of abide by the contract based on what set of events occurs prior to failure, even if these events do not occur very frequently association rules showing this relationship would still be important.

Definition 3:The ( )YX ?confidence  is the ratio of the number of default partners attributes that contain YX ?  to the number of attributes that contain X .

( ) ( )( ) ( )XYPX YXYX =??=? %100  support supportconfidence  Thus if we say that a rule has a confidence of 75%, it means that 75% of the attributes containing X  also contain Y . The confidence of a rule indicates the degree of correlation in the dataset between X  and Y .Confidence is a measure of a rule?s strength. Often a large confidence is required for association rules. If a set of events occur a small percentage or if attributes is related only rarely with other attributes, these    relationships may not be of much use for supply chain decision makers.

The overall association rule mining in history database process is interactive and iterative, involving the following steps:  Step1. Data cleaning and pre-processing: basic operations include removing noise if appropriate, collecting the necessary and easy to quantified information to model or account for noise, deciding on strategies for handling missing data fields. This step is necessary and important, without it software could not deal with the attributes and can not get the result as well as influence the efficiency.

Step2. Find out all the rules that meet the user-specified threshold support and confidence. Because decision makers may not be concern with rules that with small support and weak confidence.

Step3. Analyze the obtained results, and put the rules in the knowledge database. It is vital for all partners in the supply chain to share their information. Knowledge database collects rules and hiding knowledge of employees which could provide convenience to exchange knowledge with other partners.

We collected recently five years history data from a manufacturer. All these data record all the default partners with detail attributes. According to the proposed three steps, we delete distinctive useless attributes such as suppliers? name and ensure each item is integrity and all attributes are nonempty.

After step 2, we could discover a series of explainable rules. To the suppliers default, we find out that transportation mode always associate with default times. The support of this rule is 0.3, and the confidence of this rule is up to 87.5%.

Besides, material values are associated with transportation mode which has a high support and confidence. But to the retailers, the finance status and management conditions usually associate with delay payment. The confidence of this rule is up to 62.5%. Those rules have meaningful and instructional sense, managers have the ability to predict the default action and also can take some actions to prevent default occurrence.



V.   CONCLUSION  At present the point of the supply chain management has shifted from the integration of information to the integration of knowledge. On the other hand, the uncertainty of the supply chain has increased because of the effect of globalization. This paper analyzes the framework and the  process of knowledge-based supply chain risk management system. Then several association rule mining are discussed.

The significance of this paper is the integration of the knowledge management and the supply chain risk management. It is advantageous to raise the competitiveness of the supply chain in market. At last,we also think that implementing supply chainwide risk management is not a simple task. Often it is difficult already to assess risks, and it becomes less practical and more extensive to analyse the exposure further on in the chain, both up- and downstream.
