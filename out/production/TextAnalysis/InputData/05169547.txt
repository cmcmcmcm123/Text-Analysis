I. INTRODUCTION Web Information Extraction (WebIE), a type of  information extraction[1] sourcing from the Web, studies how to extract the implied information points on the half- structured Web pages spreading on the Internet, and express in a more structured, semantically clearer form. A mass of data sources are available for data mining, and a variety of data mining research can be done based on the different characteristics of data. Among the mining methods, the association rules mining can find the association relationship hidden in the data and have already become a commonly used method in the association knowledge discovery. For example, the Apriori algorithm[2] Agrawal, etc. proposed can mining association rules, but generates a large number of candidate item sets during getting association rules. In order to avoid generating the candidate item sets, Han, et al.

proposed the FP_Growth algorithm[3] which generates frequent itemsets based on FP_tree. FP_Growth algorithm adopts the recursive strategy of pattern growth, and its mining is a process of divide-and-conquer, but the bottleneck of the algorithm?s efficiency is mainly on the scanning sorted frequent items in turn to construct FP_tree.

When a database is very large, to construct the FP _tree based on memory is not realistic.

And releasing the Web data is with the characteristics of increment and mass, sustaining data releasing will bring a large amount of data in a short time; at the same time, in order to find the rules users are interested, it is necessary to adjust two thresholds of the minimum support and the least credibility until the interested and understandable rules are found. To face this dynamical interaction, the association rules mining algorithm must adapt to the characteristics of Web information, and has the capability of incremental mining. Researchers have developed the updated methods of frequent itemsets from different aspects, such as, FUP algorithm[4] solves the updating problem of frequent itemsets  when the content of the database increases, IUA algorithm solves continually updating problem of frequent itemsets when the minimum support changes. This paper mainly explains how to update FP_tree timely when a large number of incremental data arrives in Web information extraction, and to achieve the frequent patterns and association rules through improving the FP-Growth algorithm.



II. DESCRIPTION OF  THE  PROBLEM Assuming I = {i1,i2,?,im} is a collection including m  different items, a given transaction database D, which contains a number of transactions recorded as | D |. The itemsets X? I, support number in D refers to the transaction number of X contained in D, recorded as X.count; the support degree in D refers to the percentage of X included in D, recorded as X.sup. The relationship between X.count and X.sup is: X.count= X.sup?|D|.

Define 1 If the itemsets X? I, which support degree or support number is not less than a given minimum support threshold s, or a minimum number of support threshold ? by user, that is, X.sup ? s or X.count ? ?, said frequent itemsets in D, otherwise non-frequent itemsets.

Under the dynamical data environment, as new data sets ?D arrive, if frequent itemsets X? I  is also frequent item in ?D, then X must be frequent item in D??D; if X is a non- frequent in ?D, then not sure to be frequent item or non- frequent item in D??D; Similarly, the non-frequent item in D which must be non-frequent in D??D if it is non-frequent in ?D, if it is frequent item in ?D, then not sure to be frequent item or non-frequent item in D??D. In order to update FP_tree effectively, we can measure the change trend of transaction items with the concept of marginal growth and the potentially frequent under dynamical data environment.

Define 2 If the growth rate of X item is rX=X.count?D /

X.count?D , the growth rate of the database D is rD=| D|/ |?D|. Then the marginal growth rate is  DXmar rrX /sup_ =                                   (1)  Define 3 For a given marginal growth rate threshold ?, if Xmar_sup??, an item X is considered as potentially frequent.

Therefore, if an item X in the current database D is frequent and meet Xmar_sup >1, X must be frequent in the D??D. To update table Header of FP_tree not only depend on the minimum support threshold also depend on the marginal minimum frequency, Table Header?s projects include frequent items and potential frequent items.

DOI 10.1109/ICIC.2009.30    DOI 10.1109/ICIC.2009.30     In this way, the problem of incremental FP_Growth mining algorithm based on Web information extraction is described as follows: Assumption a frequent pattern tree FT was constructed based on data sets D by FP_Growth algorithm, in the time interval ?t, additional data sets ?D, for a given minimum support s and the minimum marginal frequency ?, how to update FT the same as the FT_tree generated based the whole data sets D??D.



III.   INCREMENTAL FP_GROWTH MINING ALGORITHM Known: database D and minimum support s, call  FP_Growth algorithm through the course of the following: (algorithm is mature, not in detail)  (1) Scanning D to get the frequency of every item, according to the minimum support, a frequent itemsets can be found;  (2) Re-scanning D for each transaction of all frequent items and inserting them into the FP_tree in table Header order;  At this point, we can draw an FP_tree: FT.

The crux of algorithm is how to merger FT and FT?  based ?D to generate new FT', the same effect as the FT_tree generated based D??D.

Algorithm: Incremental FP_Growth for Mining Association Input: FT, new increasing data sets ?D, minimum support s?, minimum marginal growth rate ? Output: frequent patterns and association rules {  Scan data sets ?D to statistic the frequency of each transaction in table Header; Calculate the marginal frequency of each transaction in table Header; Reorder the transactions of the table Header; Delete the transaction of non-frequency and non-potential frequent in table Header; If (the order of transaction of table header has been  changed) { Call FP_Growth and generate a new FP_tree: FT?;  While (FT.child! =???) { ?????????????     depth-first traversal FT and generate a frequent  itemsets: FIS; For (i=1; i<=|FIS|; i++) {  Resort the FIS? item according to the transaction order of table Header;  // use the frequent item sets from FT grow FT? Insert each item into the FT??s current node as a child node; Update the node frequency of FT?; FT? connected to the table Header; temp = itemsets? frequency ? the node?s frequency in FT;  If (temp = =0) //delete the node which frequency is zero from FT  remove the node and its sub-tree; }  Call FP_Growth (FT?); //generate frequency patterns and association rules  } Else  // Reorder the transactions of the table Header; {Resort the FIS? item according to the transaction order of  table Header; Insert each item into the FT?s current node as a child node;  FT connected to the table Header; Call FP_Growth (FT?? //extract all frequency itemsets from FT  } }  From the algorithm, FT completely disappear when FT? stop growth and the obtained FT' is equivalence to FP_tree from all the sample collection.



IV. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND APPLICATION Among the association rule mining algorithms,  FP_Growth algorithm is high efficient because it avoid Apriori algorithm? flaws of multi-scan Database, but it can not be directly used for dynamical data environment, because we cannot simply use the incremental data to update FP_tree directly. So we can only use FP_Growth algorithm to scan the updated database again to produce a new FP_tree. In this paper, the incremental FP_Growth algorithm just scans the increasing data to update the FP_tree. It is very appropriate to deal with the large and up-to-date Web information extraction problem.

In order to further verify the superiority of the incremental FP_Growth algorithm, this paper have achieved the FP-Growth algorithm and incremental FP-Growth algorithm using VC++6.0 and the SQL Server database by the computer with memory 512 MB, processor Pentium 422.

4 GHz and Windows XP operating system. An example analysis base on Web information extraction has been completed, which data is from Zoll second-hand IT trading platform (http://flea.zol.com.cn). A wrapper[5] which carries out information extraction from the Web page collect regularly the consumers? transaction information about the second-hand products(about 500 new increasing data every day), which properties include category, model, manufacturer, prices, date and so on. Store them into a local database, and then through the incremental FP-Growth algorithm to update the FP-tree, extract the frequent patterns and generate association rules. From these rules, consumer? preference for the purchase of IT products are found.

In the experiment, we collect the interested properties set A = {category, brand, model, price, trading_volume}. Price and trading volume is for discrete:  Price (Hundred Yuan): 1 below, 1-5 ,5-10 ,10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50 and above  Trading volume (number): 50, 50-100, 100-500, 500- 1000, 1000 and above  Execution time of algorithm is as shown in table 1; Purchase preference of major IT products (such as mobile phone) is as shown in table 2 (min_supp=0.1).

PURCHASE PREFERENCE OF MOBILE PHONE  From Table 1, it can be seen that execution time of incremental FP_Growth algorithm makes a little time increase. Because frequent pattern tree is generated only based on incremental data, with the rapid increase of the database the superiority of the algorithm?s efficiency will be reflected. Table 2 can be seen that the recognition of Nokia's brand is highest among mobile phone products, followed by SonyEricsion and Dopod.



V. CONCLUSIONS Mining frequent itemsets is the core of mining  association, FP_Growth algorithm is an effective method for mining frequent itemsets. But in the Web information extraction under the dynamical data environment, transaction database updates frequently and dynamically so  that it is difficult to achieve the timely update of frequent pattern tree. To that end, this paper proposes an incremental FP_Growth mining algorithm, that is, only scanning the new increasing data each can update FP_tree in a timely manner.

Experiment and application show that the algorithm is effective in reducing the generation time of PT_Tree to raise the efficiency of the mining.
