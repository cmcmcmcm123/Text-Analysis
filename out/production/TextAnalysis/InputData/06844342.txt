Secure Distribution of Big Data Based on  BitTorrent

Abstract?Recently, big data becomes more and more widespread on the Internet, as various P2P protocols, especially BitTorrent, make great contribution. Accompanied with BitTorrent spreading, however, malicious activities, divulging sensitive data and other security problems arise.

Relative researches and analyses indicate that existing means of protecting P2P network are sophisticated but intricate when distributing big data, leading inefficiency of implementation.

In this paper, a scheme to distribute big data securely and efficiently on BitTorrent network is proposed, which can be implemented in server, authorizing peers? admittances and actions, hence protecting sensitive data in the network. To achieve this goal, identity verification and cipher system are embedded into BitTorrent protocol, enabling the server to regulate and keep trace of peers? behaviors and sensitive data.

The experimental results show the functional effectiveness of this scheme, as well as acceptable overhead on server.

I. INTRODUCTION Big data has already been the hot spot in academies and  industries in recent years. The Large Hadron Collider at European Organization for Nuclear Research produces approximately 15PB of data every year [1]. As analyzed, the amount of data in the world will become 35000EB in 2020 [2]. Such rapid development challenges traditional means of storing, managing and sharing data, introducing higher requirements.

Along with the great progress of transmitting speed, security problems attract more and more attentions.

BitTorrent protocol (BT) [3] has been widely implemented in big data transmission due to its scalability and efficiency in distribution. However, many P2P systems of data distributing, including BT, have secure loopholes in aspects of nodes communication and data transmission [4]. Some of them lack the mechanism to verify admittances of nodes and data, or to resist malicious activities within the network,  which may attract various attacks, e.g., anonymous white- wash (one node pretends to be various nodes with different arbitrary identity), Service Denial, tamper and conspiracy [5].

Considering BT network, due to its only focus on function and efficiency, users (or peers) are optimistically expected to follow the protocol descriptions, and mainly concentrated on various functions of management for applications, and hence are vulnerable to malicious attacks [6], e.g., Sybil attack [7], Free-riding [8] and Byzantine attack (fake or lie about individual situation). Therefore, some ?selfish? users are able to exploit weakness of protocol and privately violate the rules to get much more benefits than ?compliant? users without being punished, even discovered.

Having no central authority or control mechanism makes these problems irresistible.

Fortunately, with the development of cryptography, there have been many methods, such as digital signature and secure log, to sustain the function of a data transmitting system, even to detect malicious behaviors and punish them [6]. Unfortunately, these methods have some issues of efficiency when facing to big data. They are essentially increasing the overhead on both server and peers by key generation and distribution, data track among nodes, or log contrast and lookup.

To address there disadvantages, this paper will propose a distributing scheme applicable to big data. After furnishing server with proper administrating function, this scheme will provide efficient distribution for big data, protect the network, keep peers? actions in tracking and private data in secret, but just require reasonable expense of server resource.

In Part II, related work in security of P2P network will be discussed. In Part III, the scheme consisting of identity verification and cipher system, is introduced generally at first, and then the detailed design and implementation will be demonstrated. In Part IV, to prove the functionality and efficiency, experiment is taken in lab and the results will be   DOI 10.1109/DASC.2013.42    DOI 10.1109/DASC.2013.42    DOI 10.1109/DASC.2013.42       shown and analyzed. After that, the conclusion and some omitted details will be covered in Part V.



II. RELATED WORK The mechanism in BT to distribute data is the source of  the problems being discussed. First of all, in BT network, the server called ?tracker? which is responsible to preserve and broadcast the information of peers and torrents (small files that contain address of tracker and hashed data of file), have no idea about the truths of those peers. In contrast, tracker updating its knowledge fully depends on the regular reports from peers, e.g., which pieces of file are requested or possessed by peer. On the other hand, tracker doesn?t have the original data by itself, so the distribution of data is occurred totally among the peers: peer who needs data (a downloader) will send the request to tracker, and be responded by a list of other peers? information (IP address, port, possessed pieces, etc.); Using this list, downloader initializes the connection by handshaking with ?proper? and ?nice? peers (a uploader or seeder who have good network condition) and downloads data from some of them [3].

In such a P2P network, behavior of a single peer is hardly controlled. Some little actions will compromise the whole network, e.g., violating the reciprocity (only downloading and never uploading) and drawing undeserved attention by lying about possessed pieces of file [5]. These actions are invisible by the tracker, or by other peers in network has no secure considerations. It?s obvious that the overall performance of distribution in such a network full of malicious peers will be impacted seriously.

There have been many researchers proposing the principle [9], or schemes to address these actions and problems. M. Kinateder and S. Pearson exploited the trust computing technic to embed a reliable platform on which all peers depend, providing privacy and security in system [10].

Damiani and coworkers focused on anonymity in P2P network, designing a reputation-based, self-regulating system in which requester run ?polling algorithm? to verify the reliability of resources before initializing download [11].

Also, J.K. So proposed a system AntiLiar to help peers independently find out and block attacks from malicious peers. These researchers concentrated on how a single peer can detect unfriend actions independently of others or tracker [6].

When it comes to big data distribution, these approaches will somehow complicate the protocol and raise the amount of information needed to be preserved or updated, even though they?re effective in resisting malicious motions.

Within a network required to distribute big data, the impact of complicated communication becomes significant and reduces the quality of service. It costs more than one can endure to just depress the dependency on central server or authority.

In the aspect of protecting private data, security and copyright brings more challenges along with widespread application of P2P and big data [4], even though reliable  encrypting and signature mechanism have been proposed, such as Identity-based signature scheme [12], and El-Gamal public-key mechanism [4], also trying to depress the dependency on trusting third party. Of course, utilizing sophisticated encryption and digital certificate indeed provides high security. Dealing with big data with these schemes, however, has little advantage due to extra overhead on transmission, when distributing cipher keys and encrypting/decrypting data, and on storage, when updating and preserving so many keys.

As we can see, BT provides a good model to distribute data, but gives little concerns about secure problems of nodes permission and sensitive data. Some strategies intending to improve efficiency are proposed [13], but potential malicious behaviors and data leakages are not taken into consideration.

First of all, the tracker (server) doesn?t verify the authentication of downloader. Any peer, as long as having a torrent file, is permitted to send download request and get list of other peers as response. That will expose every peer who possesses parts of the requested file, including their IP addresses, ports, etc. Also, the dissemination of sensitive data is hard to be controlled, causing secondary damage due to the rapid spreading, which is difficult to measure because it might be violation of intellectual property right or reveal of commercial privacy.

Therefore, the ability of server (tracker) to verify authentication of peers and data is the key to block malicious peers and inappropriate data distribution. Simply introducing ?downloading authority? to every peer and file will address the problems preliminarily: peers who have not enough authority won?t be able to get any peer?s information and the request will be rejected by tracker. But the advantage of BT, that the more peers participate, the higher speed they obtain, will be significantly weaken, because the wall of authority blocks unauthorized peers to participate in transmission.

When there is just a small group of peers transmitting data, the overall performance of BT network will be reduced. So the efficiency must be sustained while the authority is introduced to prevent some peers from getting data. In other words, the amount of peers participating in transmission cannot drop distinctly, but the range of peers able to get data needs to be restricted. One straightforward and effective method is encryption. Peer is not able to obtain original data until it decrypted the data after getting a cipher key and downloading. Those peers who only play roles of couriers have no abilities to obtain or disseminate original data even the data is transferred by them, because decryption cannot be done without a cipher key.



III. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A SECURE DISTRIBUTING SCHEME FOR BIG DATA  A. Overall Design Based on BitTorrent For the purpose of enabling tracker, the server, to  regulate the admittance of peers and the range of data spreading, protecting sensitive data without reducing the BT property?more participating peers bring more transmitting     speed, an Identity Verification and Cipher System Distribution (abbreviated, IVCSD) scheme will be proposed below. Peers will be authorized by the identity verification, and data will pass through cipher system which consists of encryption algorithm and key distributing protocol during transmission.

Figure 1.  a Brief Frame of IVCSD  Fig. 1 shows brief frame of distributing big data in IVCSD. Besides preserving and broadcasting information as original BT, tracker in IVCSD also verifies peers? identity and delivers keys that will be used by peers to decrypt downloaded data. Every peer is required to send identity information (user name and password, or token) to tracker before downloading or uploading data specified by a torrent file. Only if identity is authenticated, the peer is able to get a list of other peers? information, as well as decrypt-key, and then starts downloading or uploading data.

Notice there?re intermediaries in the data distributing network. They?re special peers, like ?couriers?, meaning that no original data will be obtained and only encrypted data will be transferred by them. It should be mentioned that these intermediaries are also authorized to admit the network, but just don?t have enough authorities to get specified data. Any peer may be an intermediary if tracker or some high- authority data centers notify it to be one, usually corresponding to a specified torrent.

This paper is focusing on secure issues of big data distribution, so the detail or scheme about how to make the ?notification? work, which is not security consideration, will not be proposed. However, the distributing scheme of intermediaries will be implemented and tested. Here is a brief of ideal behaviors of an intermediary:  Suppose that peer A becomes an intermediary to transfer file F. It will at first download some pieces of F, which are  encrypted before being uploaded. A isn?t able to decrypt them due to no access to decrypt-key, either to verify data integrity. Instead, these pieces will be stored in a map consisting of piece indices as keys and piece data as values.

When another peer, like B, requests a piece with the existing index, A will immediately retrieve the corresponding piece in the map and send it to B. The integrity of data will be the responsibility of original peer (who encrypts data) and the target peer (who decrypts data). This distributing scheme suffices to implement and test IVCSD.

The Cipher System is the significant part to differentiate target peers and intermediaries, by two important functions: (1) key generator creates a key for every new uploaded torrent; (2) only returns key to peers whose request consists of peer?s public key and digital signature which can be used by cipher system to verify authentication of the public key.

Except intermediary, every peer will only upload data after encrypting them, or get original data after decrypting them, with the requested key. Tracker will never send a key to intermediary due to the failure of identity verification.

Data will be encrypted by symmetric encryption algorithm and keys will be distributed by public-key cryptography. Using high-efficient algorithm (e.g. stream cipher) to encrypt data helps to avoid huge time expense. It?s a compromise between security and efficiency. The details of key distribution will be discussed later.

The interaction between tracker and peers are shown in Fig. 2. As indicated, peers send identity information to tracker, obtain specified keys and lists of other peers and initiate connections to download data. On the other hand, tracker preserves authority information of all peers and torrent files, makes sure that peers get original data only if they have the enough authority.

One detail should be mention here: tracker and peers both have their own key generator, but for different purposes.

Tracker?s generator is for generating key for uploaded torrent files, while peers? are for generating pairs of private and public key, which are used in signature and sending authentic request to Cipher System on tracker.

Figure 2. Interaction between Tracker and Peers    Tracker  Center of Data  Uploader  Itermediary  Authorized  Illegal Peer  Publish Torrent  Encrypt and Send  Send file key  Downloader: Receive and Decrypt  Encrypt and Send  Send Directly  Request Reject Request  Encrypt and Send       B. Identity Verification Identity verification consists of peer filter (validate the  authority of peers) and authorization (manage and regulate the authority of peers and torrents). The admittance of peers will be strictly controlled by filtering anonymous and unauthorized users out. Peers contact tracker with message that has identity information, e.g., username, password and token.

If tracker receive message that lacks of such information, it rejects the request and blocks the requester out from peer pools. Users cannot enter the network arbitrarily without identity and malicious actions will be significantly reduced.

The detailed procedure is shown in Fig. 4. For presentation in this paper, a XML-format configuring file, named ?authority.xml?, determines the authorities of legal peers. ?Announce? and ?Upload? present requests of downloading files and uploading torrents, respectively. P and T are authority of peer and torrent, respectively. One example of authority configuring file is shown in Fig. 3.

To explain, ip, username, psw_hash, authority and updated represents, respectively, IP address, username, hashed password, authority and last updating time of a peer.

Figure 3.  An example of configuring peer authority  This configuring file is just an example and suffices to propose the idea. When it comes to realistic implementation, data base or other more reliable structures should be used.

The configuration of authority should only exist in tracker, meaning that none of peers have the access and only tracker administrator is allowed to exam and edit it.

As shown in Fig. 4, when tracker receives publish request (the ?publish? branch in Fig. 4), the published torrent will be assigned with the highest authority, which will prevent any peer broadcasting data beyond its authority. Then administrators or authentic organization will determine the proper authority to this torrent and reset it. On the other hand, when dealing with download or upload request (the ?announce? branch in Fig. 4), tracker will compare the requester?s authority (P in Fig. 4) gotten from authority configuration with requested torrent?s authority (T in Fig. 4).

Only when the former authority is not lower than the latter one, a list of other peers? information will be responded back to requester. Otherwise, tracker will reject the downloading or uploading request and return a null list.

C. Cipher System As discussed before, intermediaries are needed to  maintain the transmitting speed by participating into network, increasing the number of peers who transfer a specified file.

They pass pieces of data from one peer to another without getting original data. Details of cryptographic procedure and key distribution will be demonstrated below.

1) Encryption/Decryption Procedure Data is transmitted in the form of encrypted message,  rather than raw one in original BT. It will be implemented in two places: (1) the uploader sends data after encrypting it; (2) the receiver verifies the integrity and stores data after decrypting it.

Figure 4.  Procedure of Identity Verification on Tracker    <peerAuthority> <peer> <ip>192.168.5.253</ip> <username>wyf1</username> <psw_hash>945c7d0dcc876?</psw_hash> <authority>1</authority> <updated>1363261627977</updated> </peer> </peerAuthority>  Begin  Tracker starts up.

Procedure of Encryption/Decryption  The main procedure is shown in Fig. 5 (the steps different from original BT are written bold and italic). The numbers in Fig. 5 indicate different steps, including: (1) peer A requests to download; (2) tracker responses with a list; (3) peer A initiates connection with peer B to obtain data; (4) peer B encrypts data; (5) peer B transfers encrypted data to peer A; (6) peer A decrypts data.

Notice that intermediaries don?t execute step (4) or (6).

They just transfer data from one peer to another because of lack of decrypt-key, acting almost the same behavior stated in original BT.

2) Key Generation and Distribution  Fig. 6 demonstrates the procedure of generating and distributing key. Notice that a new type of request (called ?getcipher?), differentiated from ?publish? and ?announce?, will be captured. Tracker retrieves requester?s (a peer?s) public key and digital signature, as well as identity information. After verifying the signature and identity and confirming the requester has enough authority to access the data, tracker will encrypt the corresponding data key with requester?s public key (shown by RSAE function in Fig. 6) and send the encrypted key back to requester. When receiving such a response, it will decrypt the key with its own private key (RSAD function in Fig. 6). This scheme to distribute keys to peers should be safe as long as the security of RSA scheme holds.



IV. EXPERIMENT AND RESULT ANALYSIS To implement the scheme, an open-source Java  BitTorrent API is modified and functions of IVCSD are fully achieved. Then the project is compiled on different platforms playing roles of tracker and peers. To simulate the real environment in experiment, the tracker server is running on 64-bits Linux system (Ubuntu 12.10) and all peers are running on 32-bits Windows 7 machines, just having slightly differences of CPUs and RAMs. The algorithms used to encrypt data and distribute key are RC4+ (a modified version of RC4, one kind of stream cipher) and RSA, respectively.

Figure 6.  Procedure of Generating and Distributing Key on Tracker  The experiment will be separated into two parts: identity verification and cipher system, focusing on comparing behaviors on IVCSD with those on original BT,  demonstrating the functionality of IVCSD. For identity verification, creating torrent, changing authority on server will be simulated.

All authorized and unauthorized request will be processed by tracker and the responses can prove the functionality of controlling data distribution. When testing cipher system, how a peer generates its own key pairs (public and private keys) and signature, obtains file-key from tracker and then uploads or downloads data correctly will be shown. At the same time, actions of intermediaries will also be implemented to demonstrate the protection of data.

After these experiments, examining the efficiency is necessary. The consumption of time in cipher system will be calculated and analyzed.

A. Identity Verification Experiment Identity verification participates into network when peers  send HTTP requests to tracker. During the implementation, differences of tracker behaviors between IVCSD and original BT are shown in Table I.

Fig. 7 shows differences of torrent information saved on tracker between original BT and IVCSD. To specify, torrents in IVCSD has the attribute ?authority? which doesn?t exist in original BT.

By observing the HTTP request sent by peers, three new parameters come out:  ? username = (user name of peer) ? psw = (password of peer) ? getToken = (optional, value must be ?y? when  intending to get a token)   Figure 7.  Difference in torrent between original BT and IVCSD    TABLE I.  TRACKER BEHAVIOURS OF ORIGINAL BT AND IDENTITY VERIFICATION IN IVCSD  Type of Request Original BT IVCSD  publish Only records and saves torrent files.

1. Records and saves torrent; 2. Assign the highest authority to torrent.

announce  1. Searches all peers that possess the file with torrent ID; 2. Packages these peers into a list and sends it to requester.

1. verifies the authority according to identity information provided by peers by comparing the authorities of torrent and requester;  Verification Passed  Verification Failed  2. processes the same actions as original BT.

2. notifies the requester and responses with a null list  Tracker processes these parameters, treating them as identity information. To avoid repeated using of user names and passwords in request, tracker in IVCSD allows peers to replace them with a ?token?. It?s also produced by tracker, and peers need to send request with three parameters?user name, password and ?getToken??to get a token besides a list of other peers. During the valid time (configured before starting tracker), peers can use the returned token to pass verification without user name or password.

Rejecting and approving requests in tracker log are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, respectively.

The experimental procedure demonstrates the functionality of identity verification is executed in chronological sequence as Table II, in which less number indicates higher authority. Different responses by tracker are shown.

TABLE II.  PROCEDURE OF TESTING IDENTITY VERIFICATION  Event by Peers File Authority Peer  Authority Response by  Tracker  Publish Torrent 0 (higher) 3 Publish successfully, Download rejected Requests downloading 0 (higher) 1 Rejected  Administrator changes authoritya 4 - (No log)  Requests downloading 4 1 (higher) Allowed  Requests downloading 4 3 (higher) Allowed  Requests downloading 4 (higher) 5 Rejected  a. This event is not done by peers   Figure 8.  Tracker rejects the downloading request from a peer   Figure 9.  Tracker approves the downloading request of a peer     First of all, the scheme strictly assigns the highest authority to a torrent when it?s published at the first time, avoiding any unexpected distribution of sensitive data.

Administrator resets the authority after examining the files, thereby restricts the range of peers able to get the data.

Secondly, the configuring authority file (authority.xml in the presentation, maybe data base in realistic deployment) setting authorities to all validated peers, is significant in identity verification. When any peer tries to contact tracker and requests information, this configuration allows tracker to access the authority level of requesting peers and issues proper responses, blocking unauthorized or malicious request. Therefore, the data and corresponding information will be invisible to peers who have not enough authority level.

What?s more, tracker log keeps track of all actions of torrents and peers, especially the unusual ones, such as low-authority requests or requests without identity information, during the whole experiment. The sources of these requests are correctly recorded in the log, allowing administrators to regularly inspect peers behaviors and data transmitting path.

B. Cipher System Experiment To test the accuracy of cipher system, mainly  encryption and decryption, two videos, sizes of 3.82MB and 959MB, are transmitted in this experiment. Table III shows different transmissions between cipher system in IVCSD and original BT (in either conditions, data is separated into pieces of identical size).

TABLE III.  TRANSMISSIONS IN ORIGINAL BT AND CIPHER SYSTEM  Role Original BT IVCSD  Uploader  1. Retrieves requested pieces in local files;  2. Sends out the piece.

2. Encrypts the piece with file key obtained from tracker; 3. Sends out the en- crypted piece.

Downloader  1. Receives piece;  1.1. Decrypts the piece with file key; 2. Processes Hash Verification; 3. After validating the integrity, stores the piece in local files.

Intermediary (Not exists)  1. Receives piece; 2. Stores it in RAM or local files directly, acting like a cache; 3. When being requested, sends out corresponding piece.

In the experiment, uploaded and downloaded data are all recorded in separated files. Comparing these records with original data, as shown in Fig. 10, the distinct differences demonstrate the effectiveness of encryption, meaning that any receiver isn?t able to get original  information before decrypting it. The comparison is done with a tool named ?010 Editor?, presented by Playboysen.

Figure 10.  Comparison of encrypted and original data   Figure 11.  Procedure of testing accuracy of intermediary transfer  The behavior of intermediary is tested by the procedure illustrated in Fig. 11. This procedure makes sure that the intermediary (C in Fig. 11) downloads data only from source peer (A in Fig. 11), and that target peer (B in Fig.

11) receives data only from intermediary C. Since intermediary C doesn?t perform any decryption or integrity verification, if there were mistakes during the transmission, target peer B would not get the correct data. After executing this experiment many times, target peer B always receives correct data by decrypting and hash verifying it, proving the accuracy of intermediate transmission and cipher system. To confirm that, the videos are normally played on peer B?s machine.

To summary, cipher system experiment performs all necessary procedures, including encryption, uploading, downloading and decryption, proving the functionality.

Comparison and verification of data makes sure the accuracy of these procedures. Also, behavior of  Begin  Peer A shares data as a source peer  Peer C requests data as an intermediary  Peer A encrypts and sends data to Peer C  Is the transfer completed?

(Hash  verification)  no  Compare requested data on Peer A and Peer B  yes  Finish         intermediary is implemented and tested, demonstrating that the intervention of intermediaries won?t affect the performance of cipher system. On the other hand, there?re no obvious reductions in transmitting speed during experiment due to the utility of RC4+ algorithm. The efficiency experiment confirms this conclusion will be presented later in Section D.

C. Key Generation and Distribution Experiment Generating and distributing keys are, strictly speaking,  parts of cipher system. Before any actual uploading or downloading actions, peers should obtain the key corresponding to data from tracker by sending ?getcipher? request along with identity information, public key and signature. The detail has been covered in Part III.

In the experiment, key generator on tracker generates keys to new torrents, illustrated in Fig. 12. Also, peers use their own generator to produce key pairs (public and private keys), sign their identity information and send required message to tracker in order to obtain file key. The public key will be used in two ways on tracker: (1) to verify the signature; (2) to encrypt the requested file key.

The identity information which will be signed is arbitrary, only if it?s consistent with peer?s identity and has no ambiguities. In this experiment, it will be produced as ?[username]+[password]+[ip]+[torrent hash]?.

An example of parameters to request a file key, recoded in experiment, is shown below (instructions are shown in italic form and not actually contained in HTTP request):  ? info_hash=%BE%86%A0%C7? (torrent hash) ? getCipher=yes (indicates to get file key) ? sign=PCGqKJ0fM4K.? (signature) ? key=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GN  ADCBiQKBgQCQO? (peer?s public key) The signature and public key are encoded by Base64, a  common algorithm to produce HTTP parameters.

Different from the original BT, peers who?re not intermediary will send the request containing these parameters before uploading or downloading to obtain file key, and then be able to perform data transmission through cipher system.

In the experiment, all the responses of file keys to peers are identical with the keys generated by tracker generator. Hence the encrypting transmission is also correct.

D. Efficiency Experiment and Analysis IVCSD provides protection to the network and data,  with cost of time consumed by identity verification procedure and cipher system. Since looking up authority levels of peers and torrents can be processed in parallel with existing functions of original BT (such as looking up existing torrents or registering new peers), it?s reasonable to argue that new consumption of time occurs in cipher system, especially encryption, decryption and key  generation. Therefore, in this section, cost of time will be tested and analyzed.

1) Testing Procedure a) Encryption and Decryption   Figure 12.  An example of generated key for a torrent  A random byte array with the size of 16KB (16384 bytes, identical to the size of a default piece in BT network) is generated and encrypted by RC4+ algorithm. Run this program for 10000 rounds, 100 times per round, and record the cost of time in each round.

The decryption of stream cipher algorithm (such as RC4+) is very similar to encryption, typically just reversing the procedure. It?s sure that the time consumed in decryption is nearly the same as that in encryption. So the result and analysis in uploader (encryption) will be similar to that in downloader (decryption).

b) Key Generation Nowadays, a secure length of key can be 1024 bits  (128 bytes). Recording the time used by random-number generator to produce a 128-bytes array will be crucial to determine the cost of time in key generator. Again, the program will be run for 10000 rounds, 100 times per round.

2) Result Analysis After running the programs described above, the  averages of encrypting times and key generating times are 31.24 milliseconds per round and 0.11 milliseconds per round, respectively.

a) Analysis of Encryption and Decryption With simple calculation, it?s easy to have the  conclusion that in every second, approximately 3200 arrays (reciprocal of 0.0003124) can be encrypted, in other words, 50MB data (multiply 3200 and 16KB).

As mechanism of parallel and pipeline is so common on today?s machines, the encrypting/decrypting procedure will not really delay any transmission only if the transmitting speed in BT network is no more than 50MB/s, defined as ?speed bound? here. What?s more, if parallel mechanism is performed in encryption, allowing uploader to encrypt data (or downloader to decrypt data) more than one array at a time, the speed bound should be multiplied by the number of parallels, illustrated in Fig. 13 as solid line. 50MB/s is quite acceptable because it?s beyond the bandwidth in most of machines today, especially household computers and portable laptops which uses wide bands giving a max transmitting speed of 10MB/s.

Even using a 2Gbps optical fiber, five parallel encryptions suffice to the requirement of max speed of 250MB/s. The max speeds are also illustrated in Fig. 13 as dot lines.

Since the speed bound line ascends linearly, it?s easy to determine, as the method above, how many parallels should be deployed to achieve the maximum transmitting speed of bandwidth.

Figure 13.  Speed bounds comparing to max transmitting speed  b) Analysis of Key Generation Since key generation occurs only once for a new  torrent file, it?s easy to determine that generating ten thousand keys consumes only 11 seconds (multiply 0.11 milliseconds to 10,000). So it?s safe to argue that the cost of time is negligible.

3) Efficiency of IVCSD According to the results and analyses above,  transmission in IVCSD is as efficient as original BT, meaning that adding these functions and schemes will not affect the overall performance in BT network.



V. CONCLUSION This paper proposes a scheme, Identity Verification  and Cipher System Distribution (IVCSD), to address secure problems in distributing big data. Identity verification protects the network in the aspect of peer admittance and data spreading, by assigning authority to torrents and peers, blocking unauthorized behaviors and keeping track of peers? actions. Cipher system protects the transmission in the aspect of data security and transmitting efficiency. With data encryption, intermediaries are allowed to participate into network without getting original data, sustaining the advantage of BT protocol.

After implementing IVCSD in testing machines, experiment is performed and the results are analyzed.

Functionality and efficiency is positively demonstrated in the experimental results. As a conclusion, IVCSD is a feasible scheme to distribute big data, with some compromises between security and complexity.

There?re still some imperfect conditions. (1) Although behavior of intermediaries are proposed, implemented and tested, details about how or who to trigger or stop these actions are still absent. (2) The code implementing IVCSD  for experiment in this paper uses Java. It may have some effects on evaluating efficiency. Other languages may be used in realistic deployment to achieve better performance.

(3) Restricted by facilities and environments in lab, all experiments and evaluations are completed within the local area network, instead of wider one such as Internet.

This fact may result in inaccuracy of experimental results, but according to the analyses in Part IV, the functionality won?t be affected and the efficiency will still be acceptable in future implementation.
