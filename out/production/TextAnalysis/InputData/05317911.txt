Abstract: Predicting trend in futures prices time  series has always been one of the hottest topics in research, as well as a challenging problem due to time series? volatility. In this paper we propose a new association rules mining algorithm, TB-SCM, which is based on Transaction Bool Matrix and Support Count Matrix, for predicting trend in futures prices to meet this challenge. Here, our algorithm mainly considers the preprocessing and analyzing of data.

We develop a novel time series association rules mining prototype system based on the TB-SCM algorithm and C++ STL technology, and investigate the efficiency of the system using West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures prices time series listed on the Energy Information Administration (EIA) website, as well as Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) fuel oil futures? closing prices time series on hexun website. The empirical study shows that TB-SCM algorithm out-perform classical Apriori algorithm available in Weka data mining software which is developed by Waikato University in terms of generating time series association rules without redundancy.

Keywords: association rules, data mining, futures prices predicting, time series  1 Introduction   Futures prices time series has its own particularity besides the universal characteristics of data sets, and its volatility makes prediction a challenging task, whereas the analysis of it has always been a hotspot of Economics and Statistics as its findings is essential in the formulation of exact pricing and the decision-making.

Presently, a great deal of effort has been devoted to developing time series predicting models[1,2,3].

Well-established and applied techniques include: (a) linear models, such as the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)[4]; (b) non-linear models, such as the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)[5,6,7], fuzzy system models and Support Vector Machines (SVM)[8,9,10]; (c) a combination of linear and non-linear models[11,12,13].

Recently, there has been increasing interest in applying data mining technology to time series analysis.

Mining association rules [14, 15], as one of the important  topics in data mining, aimed at finding interesting relationships between items from data sets, the rules found can not only describe the law of the related data objects? historical development, but also can be used to predict the future development trend according to the current status of the data objects. Thus, the exploratory research of applying the association rules approach to discover the potential, useful pattern from time series is of great significance in trend predicting[16]. In the futures market, the association rules mining can be used to find the linkage relations between different futures, common rules found can be described as ?In a certain time frame, if WTI (West Texas Intermediate) crude oil price rises, then the possibility of SHFE (Shanghai Futures Exchange) fuel oil price rises at the same time is 80%?, however, investors may be more interested in this kind of rules like ?In a certain time frame, if WTI crude oil and SHFE fuel oil prices rise on the first day, and WTI crude oil price falls, but SHFE fuel oil price rises on the second day, then the possibility of SHFE fuel oil price falls on the third day is 80%?. Rules in the second form, called time series association rules, contain more information, as the former and latter cases of the rules have time constraints, and are more important in making invest decisions.

In this paper, after study the exist literatures of association rules mining algorithm or related[17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26], we realize this idea and introduce a novel algorithm TB-SCM which is based on Transaction Bool Matrix and Support Count Matrix for extracting time series association rules in a more effective way without redundancy. This approach first discrete the prices time series with a user-defined threshold that define the up, fair and down trend of prices, then carry out data preprocess with a sliding time window. After preprocessing, the algorithm carries on, finds the time series association rules and displays them in a visual way.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the time series association rules mining algorithm TB-SCM. In section 3, experiments and results are described in detail using WTI Crude oil futures and SHFE fuel oil futures prices. Section 4 concludes this paper and indentifies potential future research directions.

September 14-16, 2009                              Moscow, Russia    - 1512 -   2 Algorithm   The process of data mining includes data preprocessing, data mining, model evaluation and knowledge representation. In this section, we first introduce the method of futures prices time series preprocessing, then describe the novel algorithm TB-SCM, which involves the last three phrase of data mining.

2.1 Data preprocessing  Suppose we have a time series data set DS={T?P1? P2???Pn}, where T is time, Pi>0(i [1,n]? )represents a price of a certain futures, each record is composed of Tj, a value of T, and every futures? price under Tj. Futures P?s prices under Tj and Tj-1 is P[Tj] and P[Tj-1], then:  If P[Tj] - P[Tj-1]??, futures P?s incident under Tj is ?up?  If ???P[Tj] - P[Tj-1]??, futures P?s incident under Tj ?fair?  If P[Tj] - P[Tj-1]???, futures P?s incident under Tj is ?down?  Here, ?>0 is a user-defined value. After discretion, we get a new data set DS'?{T?P1'?P2'???Pn'}, where Tj is the same as in DS, Pi' is futures P?s incident under time Tj(up, fair, down).

Consider the sample data set containing 8 records in Tab.1. Let ?=2, after discretion, we get a new data set containing 7 records, see in Tab.2. In the new data set, we link the futures? name and its incident by ?:? to form an item, different items generated by different futures are separated by a comma.

Tab.1 Sample data set  Time P1 P2 1 32 22 2 30 25 3 33 25 4 37 28 5 40 26 6 38 23 7 35 27 8 39 30   Tab.2 Data discretion  Time Items 1 -- 2 P1:down,P2:up 3 P1:up, P2:fair 4 P1:up, P2:up 5 P1:up, P2:down 6 P1:down, P2:down 7 P1:down, P2:up 8 P1:up, P2:up   Time Sliding Window (STW) is composed of w  property values under consecutive time points, recorded  as STW[1], STW[2], ?, STW[w]. All the property values in the time sliding window consist of a Sliding Time Transaction Set (STTS), and STTS={1:STW[1], 2:STW[2], ?, w:STW[w]}, the prefix number indentifies the position of the item in the time sliding window. If STW[i](1?i?w) has more than one item, then its prefix number will be assigned to each of them.

Consider the data set in Tab.2, let w=3, and there are 5 time sliding windows Win1, Win2, Win3, Win4, Win5. Each time sliding window covers 3 time points, consist of 3 property values, see in Fig.1.

Fig.1 Time sliding window  All the property values in a window make up a  sliding time transaction set, so we get 5 records after processing, see in Tab.3.

Tab.3 Sliding time transaction set  Items  P1:down,1:P2:up,2:P1:up,2:P2:fair,3:P1:up,3:P2:up  P1:up,1:P2:fair,2:P1:up,2:P2:up,3:P1:up,3:P2:down  P1:up,1:P2:up,2:P1:up,2:P2:down,3:P1:down,3:P2:down  P1:up,1:P2:down,2:P1:down,2:P2:down,3:P1:down,3:P2:up  P1:down,1:P2:down,2:P1:down,2:P2:up,3:P1:up,3:P2:up   2.2 Time series association rules mining  The data structures mainly used by TB-SCM are Transaction Bool Matrix and Support Count Matrix.

Transaction Bool Matrix[27,28] (TBM) is an N?M matrix, where N is the total record number of the data set, and M is the number of items involved in it. If item Ij is contained by transaction Ti, then the value of TBM[i][j] is 1, otherwise, its value is 0. For every itemset, we introduce two fields support index and support count, where the index is composed of values 0 and 1, the ith value of it indicates whether the ith record in the data set contains this itemset or not. For example, we have a 14-record data set (see in Fig.2), consider itemset {I1}, its support index {I1}.index=10011011110011, and {I2}.index=11110101101011, and their support count can be obtained by simply calculating the number of 1 appear in the index, such as {I1}.SupportCount=9,  Time Items  2 P1:down,P2:up  Win1    3 P1:up,P2:fair  Win2    4 P1:up,P2:up  Win3    5 P1:up,P2:down  Win4    6 P1:down,P2:down  Win57 P1:down,P2:up  8 P1:up,P2:up    - 1513 -   {I2}.SupportCount=10, while through the logic ?and? operation of {I1}.index and {I2}.index, we can easily get the index of another composition itemset, e.g.

{I1,I2}.index {I1}.index&{I2}.index=10010001100011.

Thus, the element in row i and column j can be mark as SCM[Ii][Ij], and its value represents Item Ij?s appear times as suffix of item Ii. All the items involved in SCM matrix?s rows and columns are arranged by dictionary order. Consider the data set in Fig.2, its Support Count Matrix is in Fig.3.

Fig.3 Support count matrix   TB-SCM algorithm uses the fundamental nature of frequent itemsets, that is, ?All the none-empty subsets of frequent itemsets must be frequent? and ?None of the super-sets of nonfrequent itemsets can be frequent?. The process of the algorithm, see in Fig. 4.

The algorithm works through three steps: step1: Create the Support Count Matrix and  Transaction Bool Matrix. Initial the two matrixes TBM and SCM, and scan each record of the data set and update them according to the items appearance in the record.

Fig.4 Process of TB-SCM   CreateMatrix?TBM, SCM, T? { Initial TBM[N][M] and SCM[M][M];  // M is the number of items involved and // N is the number of the record sets for each record Ti dataset  ? //  Ti is the ith record of the dataset {//  process current record  update the ith row in TBM {  for each item Ij  //  Ij is the jth column of TBM if Ij T? i  //Ti contains Ij then TBM[i][j] = 1; else TBM[i][j] = 0;  } // update SCM, the rows and columns of SCM are //identified by the items For each item Ik T? i {  SCM[Ik][ Ik]= SCM[Ik][ Ik]+1; //process the suffix of Ik in Ti For each (Ih T? i )>Ik  SCM[Ik][ Ih]= SCM[Ik][ Ih]+1; }  } }  step2: Find all the frequent Itemsets meet the requirement that the first item?s prefix number must be ?1? in every frequent itemset. We can find the 1-frequent itemsets and 2-frequent itemsets directly from SCM with min_sup.

Find_All_Frequent_Itemsets(T, min_sup) { // find the 1-frequent itemsets and  // 2-frequent itemsets directly from SCM, L?L1 L? 2 L=Find_Frequent_Itemsets?SCM, min_sup?; // find k-frequent itemsets?k>=3?Lk? // until Lk is empty K = 3; While(Lk-1 is not empty) {// find Lk according to Lk-1, TBM and SCM  Lk=Find_kFrequent_Itemsets(k, Lk-1, TBM, SCM, min_sup);  L =L? k; k++;  } } This function finds 1-frequent itemsets and 2-frequent itemsets directly from SCM with min_sup: Find_Frequent_Itemsets?SCM, min_sup?

To avoid redundant rules, we check every k-frequent itemset {I1, I2, ?, Ik} (k>=2), if Ik?s prefix number is w (Sliding Time Window? width) , and Ik-1?s prefix number is less than w, then calculate the potential rule?s support, sup={I1, I2, ?, Ik}.SupportCount/N, where N is the number of records in the data set, and its confidence, conf={I1, I2, ?, Ik}.SupportCount/{I1,I2,?,Ik-1}.SupportCount. If sup >= min_sup and conf>=min_conf, generate a new rule ?{I1,I2,?,Ik-1}=>{Ik}[support=sup, confidence=conf]?.

Generate_Timeseries_AssociationRules(L, w, min_conf) { // k is the largest itemset?s size for each k-frequent itemset Lk={I1,I2,?,Ik}  { if(Ik?s prefix number =w  && Ik-1?s prefix number !=w) {  //calculate the potential rule?s support and confidence sup={I1,I2,?,Ik}.SupportCount/N;  conf={I1,I2,?,Ik}.SupportCount/ {I1,I2,?,Ik-1}.SupportCount;  if(sup?min_sup&&conf?min_conf) // R is the set of time series association rules  R =? {I1,I2,?,Ik-1}=> {Ik}[support=sup,confidence=conf];  } } }  3 Experiments and results   We develop a novel time series association rules mining prototype system including data preprocessing, association rules mining and knowledge presentation based on the TB-SCM algorithm and C++ STL technology under Visual Studio 2005 Development platform, the system?s framework see in Fig.5.

Fig.5 Frame work of time series association rules mining system   To investigate the efficiency of the novel algorithm  and the prototype system, we conduct an experiment using West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures prices time series(793 instances) listed on the EIA(Energy Information Administration) website, as well as (SHFE) Shanghai Futures Exchange fuel oil futures prices closing prices time series(629 instances) on hexun website, see in Fig.6.

Fig.6 Data set of WTI and SHFE    - 1515 -   The current pricing adjustment mechanism for refined oil in China is adjusted by the National Development and Reform Commission in accordance with the prices of New York, Singapore and Rotterdam, therefore, the oil price in China is mainly impacted by the three places? oil prices, including the WTI Crude oil futures, which is one of the three crude oil benchmarks, in New York Mercantile Exchange. Our experiment will give some proofs about this.

After preprocessing (the ? of WTI is 0.2, SHFE is 2, time window width is 3), we have 601 instances. We set the min_sup and min_conf as 0.05 and 0.70, and discover 15 time series association rules. See in Fig.7.

The first time series association rule found is: 1:SHFE:up,1:WTI:down,2:SHFE:down,2:WTI:up=  >3:SHFE:up[support=6.32%,confidence=84.4%] This rule indicates that if SHFE fuel oil futures  price is up and WTI Crude oil futures price is down on the first day, and on the second day SHFE is down and WTI is up, then on the third day SHFE is up?s support is 6.32%, confidence is 84.4%. We can also find that all the latter cases in the rules found are about SHFE, that means the SHFE fuel oil futures price has a strong correlation with the WTI Crude oil futures price.

For comparison, we conduct another experiment using the same data set in Weka data mining software which is developed by Waikato University, the results are show in Fig.8. Check these rules, such as ?101.

2=WTI:up 3=SHFE:down 3=WTI:down 47 ==> 2=SHFE:up 33    conf:(0.7)?(where 47 is support count of items contained in the former case, 33 is the whole rules? items support count), this rule predicts the second day?s trend by the incident of the third day, it?s not practical, hence this rule is redundant. Out of the 101 rules found by Weka, we can find 15 rules useful the same as in our system.

This shows that our Time Series Association Rules Mining System based on TB-SCM algorithm is more effective, it can generate time series association rules without redundancy.

4 Summary and future work   This paper presented a novel association rules mining algorithm TB-SCM for mining futures prices time series association rules, it?s more effective than the classical Apriori, and can generate the aimed rules without redundancy.

Futures market has not only a large amount of data, but also a considerable number of real-time data, opportunities are fleeting, how to timely discover the relevant rules, and how to find the new rules without re-mining the whole data set when data is updated is of great importance. Therefore, the next step of our research work is to realize the dynamic updates and incremental association rules mining.
