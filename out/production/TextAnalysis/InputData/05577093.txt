A Comparison of Analysis Methods of Pipe Failure  Characteristics Based on Maintenance Records of

Abstract?The characteristic data applied for establishing predicting models of pipe failure in water distribution system (WDS) should be examined and screened in the first place. The effects of different way of data processing based on a series on maintenance records are compared, which includes a classification method by Bayesian theorem, a hypothesis testing by analysis of variance and an association rule of data mining.

The result shows the Bayesian theorem is applicable for nonparametric analysis, and can give classification limits intuitively. But this method may neglect the relations between different variates and effects. It?s proper to adopt this method when there are few pipe characteristics available. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) is able to point out the interaction of variates and deal with both parametric and nonparametric tests. The association rule can provide correlations between different attributes, but may also bring excessive and nonsense results and it appears that more detailed records are required to make use of this method. It is suggested that the data should be carefully examined in appropriate method before applied to a model.

I.  INTRODUCTION The water distribution system has played an important role  in maintaining the urban functionalities. To keep this system operated in good conditions, it needs better strategies, which can save funds and enhance the efficiency. While establishing prediction or regression models for giving strategies based on the maintenance records, the model should select variates such as those pipe attributes or environmental characteristics which may lead to the failure, and discard those don't make sense. If there are still too many variates, it's necessary to pick out those variates with great importance either according to their screening abilities or the availabilities. Kurkarni[1] related the probability of pipe failure to the system wide failure rate, the rate that specific characteristics observed on failed pipes and that of not failed pipes, and carried out a model based on the Bayesian theorem. Shridhar Yamijala[2] adopted principle component analysis to reduce the soil corrosivity covariates to transformed orthogonal covariates, and analyzed the Parameter  significance results by Poisson generalized linear  model. Raed Jafar[3] applied a preliminary study of the correlation and chi- square test to analyze the influence of the input indicators and divided them into 3levels. May[4] proposed an algorithm to develop artificial neural network models to forecast water quality in order to reduce the need for arbitrary judgment and extensive trial-and-error during model development. The algorithm selects inputs based on the analysis of relationship strength between inputs and outputs, and between redundant inputs. Vladan Babovic[5] applied a data mining approach to the modeling of water supply assets by analyzing the database of already occurred bursts events in order to establish a risk model as a function of associated characteristics of bursting pipe (its age, diameter, material of which it is built, etc.), soil type in which a pipe is laid, climatological factors (such as temperature), traffic loading, etc. Since the analysis of the characteristics (inputs, parameters) includes many different methods, it?s necessary to decide which one is not only able to make full use of the data collected and also can avoid redundant computing.

This paper compares 3 different methods of selecting model variates including the Bayesian theorem, ANOVA and the association rules, and describes the appropriate situations on to apply these methods. The first to method are applied to the same case to compare and verify their classification abilities, and the association rule is applied to another case to test the suitable conditions for it. This is because the first case mainly consists of continuous variates and the association rule is more suitable for the discrete variates.



II. THE SMALL SAMPLE CONCEPT[6] In classical survival analysis, once the sample failed or  died, it would be immediately removed from the research population. But in the maintenance of WDS, the failed pipes, especially those long pipes in large diameter, are repaired and reused, that would induce a trouble on how to define the population of the repaired pipes (samples). Cooper [7] developed a probability-based trunk mains burst risk model with GIS, which divided the long pipes and surroundings into small pieces and tested them of all the characteristics. This  This work is supported by: National Natural Science Foundation of China (50778121), National Key Technology R&D Program (2006BAJ03A10, 2006BAJ16B02-01)     paper introduces a concept of the WDS samples similar to this method. A whole pipe, which used to be treated as one sample, is divided into small samples (e.g. 1m each sample) and calculated respectively. It should be emphasized that the samples can?t be too small, which would bring a large population and result in the disappearance of the statistical significance of the failed samples.

According to the maintenance records, the repaired or replaced pipe segments are generally no longer than 1m, for the failures are usually pitting or circular break, caused by corrosion or bending forces, even the longitudinal splits are seldom longer than several meters.  However, after applied 1m samples by the survival analysis, it appears that the samples are so small that the population is too large to show the statistical significance of the failed samples.

In this paper, the small pipe sample is set to 10m, and those pipes shorter than 10m are treated as one sample.



III. THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE CHARACTERISTICS Although the selection of characteristics has great influence  on the applicability of the model, the classification may also play an important role in the precision of the model. For example, the extremely low flow rate in water pipe may cause the tuberculation corrosion to the pipe wall, but the difference of the impacts of the flow rate of 0.01m/s and 0.02m/s shouldn?t be significant. Considering such kind of situation, it is essential to classify the characteristic to different grades, like low and high, or medium if needed.

According to the Bayesian theorem, the probability of failure at the presence of specific characteristics (c) is  ( )fnfcffc ffc  cf PPPP PP  P ?+  = 1|  .   (1)  Where the Pf is the system-wide probability of failure, the Pc/f is the probability of observing specified characteristics on a sample that failed and the Pc/nf is the probability of observing specified characteristics on a sample that has not failed.  Then the Enhancement of the Failure Rate (EFR) at the presence of a specific characteristic (c) can be calculated as  %1001/ ?? ? ?  ? ? ? ?  ? ?=  f  cf c P  P EFR   (2)  Fig. 1 describes the application of this method based on the flow rate characteristic of specific maintenance records. It shows that the EFRv has kept a higher level in the region of low flow rate (the first negative value should be due to the small sample size at that flow rate), and it declines significantly as the cumulated percentage of pipe samples growing according to the increase of the flow rate. It is concluded that the low flow rate, which is less than 0.05m/s, has an outstanding enhancing effect onto the pipe failure rate.

Further, the flow rate is classified to two classes and transformed to dummy variate:  ? ? ?  > ?  = smv smv  v /05.00 /05.01    In this case, the traffic load is also classified to two classes.

IV. ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE A 2-variates factorial ANOVA (F-test) is used to analyze if  there are significant difference of pipe failure rate between the samples which have different level of characteristics, flow rate and traffic load. The samples are assumed to be independent to each other and there is no interaction between two variates. It is also assumed that the errors are normally distributed and the random variates have the same finite variances.

In this case, the null hypothesis to be tested is that all levels of the flow rate and traffic load have the same effect on the pipe failure rate (R), expressed as: H0v: Rv1=Rv2, H0n Rn1=Rn2.

The alternative hypothesis is H1v: Rv1?Rv2, H1n Rn1?Rn2. The test is carried out on R, an open-source statistic software package, and the result is listed in Tab. 1.

TABLE I.  RESULTS OF ANOVA  df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)  v 1 0.192 0.192 5.8464 0.01577 n 1 0.010 0.010 0.3187 0.57252 Residuals 1114 36.505 0.033 Total 1116 36.707    The result shows that the null hypothesis H0v is falsified and the H0n is approved under the significant level of ?=0.05.

The normality is then examined by Shapiro?Wilk test and the homoscedasticity is examined by Bartlett test. It shows that in this case, the data are neither normal nor homoscedastic, so the      Kruskal?Wallis test, a nonparametric alternative which does not rely on an assumption of normality, is adopted to examine the hypothesizes. The results, listed in Tab. 2, shows that the null hypothesis H0v is falsified and the H0n is approved again.

RESULTS OF KRUSKAL-WALLIS TEST  Data Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared df p-value  v 5.8247 1 0.01580  n 0.3582 1 0.5495    According to the tests, the influence of different flow rate levels are significant, which indicates that the extremely low flow rate may enhance the failure rate, but that influence of traffic load is not supported. The test of ANOVA shows that the classification methods may have ignored some other interactions that worked in this case. In contrast, the ANOVA may take the interactions into account which assumed to between the flow rate and the traffic load in this case. However, it is inappropriate to test the interaction by the F-test since the data in this case is neither normal nor homoscedastic.



V. ASSOCIATION RULE Association rule mining finds interesting associations  and/or correlated relationships among large set of data items.

Association rules show attribute?s value conditions that occur frequently together in a given dataset. In this case, there are 7 attributes (pipe diameters, pipe materials, pavement materials, types of subgrade soil, traffic load levels, causes of pipe breakage and types of pipe failure) which contain 33items (value of pipe characteristics) and 45transactions (records). The analysis result shows that among the 480 rules, there are 120rules of which the support is over 0.2 and the confidence is more than 0.9.

Most rules are either nonsense or just reflecting objective facts, like the grass are paved on original soil or the traffic loads are low on the grass. Tab. 3 lists a few rules that make sense. It demonstrates that the high traffic load caused pipe failures are probably circular break, which has a support at 0.22 and confidence at 0.91. Also the failures of DN200 pipes which buried in grass are usually due to construction damages.

TABLE III.  SAMPLES OF ASSOCIATION RULE RESULT  LHS RHS Sup. Conf. Lift High traffic load Circular break 0.22  0.91  1.86  Other failure causes Circular break 0.42  0.95  1.94  DN200,grass Construction damages 0.20  0.90  2.38    It?s hard to select the meaningful rules in such a large group due to the lack of criterion and engineering experience and the repeat of similar rules. Another problem is that usually the maintenance records are too general to distinguish different pipe failure. Such as, the failure causes are briefly divided in to soil subsidence, temperature changes, construction damages and other courses without mentioning the transient pressure, the corrosion or bad installation. So the application of this method needs a more detailed maintenance records which defines as much conditions as possible.



VI. CONCLUSION Based on the analysis above, it may conclude as: 1) The  Bayesian theorem is applicable for nonparametric analysis, and can give intuitive classification limits to the continuous variates.

But this method may neglect the interactions between different variates and effects. It?s proper to adopt this method when there are few pipe characteristics available. This method may also concern the combination of multi characteristics, but that would lead to large amount of computing tasks. 2) The ANOVA is able to point out the interactions of variates and deal with both parametric test (F-test) and nonparametric test (Kruskal?Wallis test), but the test of interaction needs the normality and homoscedasticity of the maintenance records. 3) The association rules can provide correlations between different attributes, but most results are either nonsense or reflecting the objective facts, and more detailed records are needed to reach more practical conclusions.
