A thorough experimental study of datasets for frequent itemsets

Abstract  The discovery of frequent patterns is a famous problem  in data mining. While plenty of algorithms have been pro-  posed during the last decade, only a few contributions have  tried to understand the influence of datasets on the algo-  rithms behavior. Being able to explain why certain algo-  rithms are likely to perform very well or very poorly on  some datasets is still an open question.

In this setting, we describe a thorough experimental  study of datasets with respect to frequent itemsets. We study  the distribution of frequent itemsets with respect to itemsets  size together with the distribution of three concise represen-  tations: frequent closed, frequent free and frequent essential  itemsets. For each of them, we also study the distribution of  their positive and negative borders whenever possible.

From this analysis, we exhibit a new characterization of  datasets and some invariants allowing to better predict the  behavior of well known algorithms.

The main perspective of this work is to devise adaptive  algorithms with respect to dataset characteristics.

1 Introduction  The discovery of frequent patterns is a famous prob-  lem in data mining, introduced in [2] as a first step for  mining association rules. While plenty of algorithms have  been proposed during the last decade [3, 10, 20, 22, 35],  only a few contributions have tried to understand the influ-  ence of dataset characteristics on the algorithms behavior  [19, 20, 32]. These studies focus on the number of trans-  actions, average length of transactions, or frequent item-  sets distribution, i.e. statistics from frequent itemsets and  maximal frequent itemsets are usually given. Nevertheless  algorithms could have quite different behaviors for (appar-  ently) similar datasets. Benchmarks comparing algorithms  performances have been done on real and synthetic datasets  [5, 19] (see FIMI website [18]). Algorithm implementa-  tions and datasets are freely available from [18] for min-  ing frequent, frequent closed or frequent maximal itemsets.

Even with all these informations, being able to explain why  certain algorithms are likely to perform very well or very  poorly on some datasets is still an open question.

More generally, studying datasets can provide useful  hints for devising adaptive algorithms [17, 31], i.e. algo-  rithms which adapt themselves to data characteristics in or-  der to increase their time or memory efficiency. Adaptive  behavior of algorithms is not new in the setting of frequent  itemsets mining, for example [7, 10] use heuristics to decide  when tries-like data structure, representing datasets and/or  itemset collections, have to be rebuilt. The promising re-  sults obtained by these algorithms show the interest of ap-  plying specific strategies according to dataset features.

Another key point is that some problems have specific in-  variant characteristics, whatever the studied datasets. Their  impact on algorithms could give useful information about  the difficulty to solve these problems while giving hints on  the more appropriate strategies to cope with these difficul-  ties.

Related works Classical characteristics of datasets were  studied in [20], and more particularly a density criteria. Up  to our knowledge no formal definition of density does ex-  ist. According to [20], a dataset is dense when it produces  many long frequent itemsets even for high values of mini-  mum support threshold. The authors studied seven datasets,  each of them capturing a fairly large range of typical uses.

The result of these experimentations is a classification of  datasets in four categories according to the density. The  density is estimated by using the characteristics of maximal  frequent itemsets.

The main problem of their classification concerns its  variability with respect to minimum support threshold val-      ues. For example, a dataset could belong to the first cate-  gory for a given threshold value, and to the second category  for another threshold value1. Moreover, there is no clear  relationship between the proposed classification and algo-  rithms performances. Even worse, a surprising result was  obtained in the last FIMI workshop [5]: algorithms seem to  be more efficient on some very dense datasets than on some  other sparser datasets. Note also that in [37], in order to  easily compare different implementations, a tool has been  developped from information available at the FIMI website.

Based on the works done in [20], [32] proposed a statisti-  cal property of transactional datasets to characterize dataset  density. Actually, they consider the dataset as a transac-  tion source and measure an entropy signal, i.e. the transac-  tions produced by such a source. Moreover, they show how  such a characterization can be used in many fields, from  performance prediction, minimum support threshold range  determination, sampling, to strategy decisions. As for the  previous work, it does not explain algorithms performances  anymore. This may be due to the fact that only frequent  itemsets are used to calculate the entropy measure.

In [27], the positive border distribution (i.e. the num-  ber of maximal elements in each level) is considered as a  key parameter to characterize transaction databases. It is  proved that any distribution is ?feasible?, and thus suscep-  tible to be met in practice. Moreover, a constructive theo-  rem is proposed to compute a synthetic transaction database  given a positive border distribution as input. Nevertheless,  the negative border is never considered and as a result, such  synthetic databases do not match the ?complexity? of real-  world datasets.

Contribution In this setting, we describe a thorough ex-  perimental study of datasets with respect to frequent item-  sets. We study the distribution of frequent itemsets with re-  spect to itemsets size together with the distribution of three  concise representations: frequent closed, frequent free and  frequent essential itemsets. For each of them, we also study  the distribution of their positive and negative borders when-  ever possible. From this analysis, we exhibit a new classi-  fication of datasets and some invariants allowing to better  predict the behavior of well known algorithms.

The main perspective of this work is to devise adaptive  algorithms with respect to dataset/problem characteristics.

Paper organization In section 2, we introduce some pre-  liminaries. Experimental study of datasets is given in sec-  tion 3, including usual representations of frequent itemsets,  experimental protocol, results and analysis. The section 4  1As a concrete example, this case arises with Pumsb? dataset with  minimum support threshold values equal to 15% and 25% respectively.

Other examples are given in [16].

presents the main results of this work: a new dataset classi-  fication and a study of the influence of anti-monotone pred-  icate on the resolution of some problems. Finally, we con-  clude and give some perspectives for this work.

2 Preliminaries  Let R be a set of symbols called items, and r a database  of subsets of R. The elements of r are called transactions.

An itemset X is a set of some items of R. The support of  X is the number of transactions in r that contain all items  of X . An itemset is frequent if its support in r exceeds a  minimum support threshold value, called minsup. Given a  minimal support threshold and a database, the goal is to find  all frequent itemsets.

We recall the notion of borders of a set using notations  given in [30]. Let (I,?) be a partially ordered set of ele- ments. A set S ? I is closed downwards if, for all X ? S, all subsets of X are also in S. S can be represented by  its positive border Bd+ (S) or its negative border Bd? (S) defined by:  Bd+ (S) = max?{X ? S}  Bd? (S) = min?{Y ? I ? S}  Let p be an anti-monotone predicate on (I,?), i.e.

?X, Y ? I, X ? Y , if p(Y ) is true, then p(X) is true.

If S is the set of elements of I satisfying p, then S is closed  downwards.

For instance, a set of frequent itemsets FI in a database  with respect to a given minimum support threshold value is  closed downwards. In this case, Bd+ (FI) is often called the set of maximal frequent itemsets.

3 Thorough experimental study of datasets  In order to introduce our experimental study, we first de-  scribe three classical representations of frequent itemsets.

Then, our experimental protocol is explained and our exper-  imental results are given and discussed. To end up, a rela-  tionship between these results and algorithms performances  is also pointed out.

3.1 Usual representation of frequent itemsets  Several concise (or condensed) representations of fre-  quent itemsets have been studied [12, 29]. Their goal is  twofold: improving efficiency of frequent itemsets mining  whenever possible, and compacting the storage of frequent  itemsets for future usages.

Formally, a condensed representation must be equivalent  to frequent itemsets: one can retrieve each frequent item-  set together with its frequency without accessing data [12].

Such a representation is known as closed sets [33, 34, 38].

Two other representations are considered in this paper: fre-  quent free itemsets [4, 8] and frequent essential itemsets  [13]. Notice that these sets are not exactly sufficient to rep-  resent frequent sets, since they need a subset of the frequent  itemsets border to become condensed representations [12].

We briefly describe these representations in the rest of  this section.

Frequent Closed sets Given an itemset X , the closure of  X is the set of all items that appear in all transactions where  X appears. Formally, given a transaction database r:  Cl(X) = ?  {t ? r|X ? t}  If Cl(X) = X then X is said to be closed.

Frequent free itemsets An itemset X is said to be free if  there is no exact rule of the form X1 ? X2 where X1 and X2 are distinct subsets of X . Free sets can be efficiently  detected through the following property:  X is free ?? ?x ? X, sup(X) < sup(X ? x)  Frequent essential itemsets The notion of essential item-  sets has been defined recently in [13]. It is based on the  notion of disjunctive rule [11, 25]. A disjunctive rule is of  the form X ? A1 ? A2... ? An. Such a rule is satisfied if, every transaction that contains X contains at least one of  the elements A1, ..., An.

An itemset X is said to be essential if there is no disjunc-  tive rule of the form A1 ? A2? . . .?Ak, where (Ai)i=1..k are distinct elements in X . As for free sets, they can be  efficiently tested exploiting the following property:  X is essential ?? ?x ? X, supdij(X) > supdij(X ? x)  where supdij(X) = |{t ? r | t ? X ?= ?}|  The predicates ?being a frequent free itemset? and ?being  a frequent essential itemset? are anti-monotone w.r.t. set  inclusion. In the following, we study the distributions of  these three collections w.r.t. itemsets size.

Other concise representations based on the notion of dis-  junctive rules have been defined, the reader is referred to the  general framework proposed in [12] for more details.

To end up, we believe that our choice of concise repre-  sentations covers a fairly large range of typical cases.

3.2 Experimental protocol  For frequent itemsets, a benchmark of fourteen datasets  is commonly used [18]. Most of them are real-life datasets,  only two being synthetic ones, generated by the generator  from the IBM Almaden Quest research group [1]. All ex-  periments have been done on these datasets. Each dataset  has been studied for many representative minimum support  thresholds, from very high to very low values. For each  one, frequent itemsets, frequent closed, frequent free and  frequent essential itemsets, have been collected. We have  studied their distribution with respect to itemsets size, i.e.

the number of elements in each level (from one to the size  of the largest itemsets). Moreover, we have studied the posi-  tive and negative borders distributions of frequent, frequent  free and frequent essential itemsets 2.

To perform these tests, we used algorithms available at  the FIMI website [18]. The discovery of frequent itemsets  and frequent closed itemsets has been done using FPClose  and FP ? growth? algorithms from [21]. ABS [17] has been updated to find frequent free and frequent essential  itemsets.

To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one  to address the understanding of datasets for frequent item-  sets and other concise representations by using their nega-  tive borders.

3.3 Experimental results  In order to perform a fair comparison with [20], re-  sults given in this paper focus on the same datasets, i.e.

Chess, Pumsb, Connect, Pumsb?, Mushroom and T10I4D100K. Notations used in the sequel are reported in Table 1.

FI frequent itemsets  FCI frequent closed itemsets  FFI frequent free itemsets  FEI frequent essential itemsets  Table 1. Notations  Given a dataset and a minimum support threshold value,  the Table 2 describes a typical example of our experimen-  tal results. Due to space limitations, the reader is referred  to [16] for comprehensive results from which the analysis  made in this paper has been performed. A wider range of  minimum support threshold values and other datasets are  also described in [16].

In the rest of this section, we discuss our experimental  results with respect to three main axes: borders distribution  of frequent itemsets, stability of borders distribution with  respect to support threshold values and borders distribution  of frequent free and essential itemsets.

2The set of closed itemsets is not closed downwards, and thus the notion  of borders does not apply.

Chess dataset, minsup = 30%  Borders distribution of frequent itemsets Consider the  positive and negative borders of frequent itemsets from five  datasets as given in Figure 1. First of all, we observe  ?bell curve? distributions for the two borders in almost all  datasets. Since every distribution of positive border is fea-  sible in theory [27], other properties should exist to explain  these distributions. Moreover, the negative and positive bor-  ders seem to follow the same behavior even if the negative  border is always ?lower? than its corresponding positive  border. From [30], we also know that the negative border  may have elements just one level after the positive border.

This case never occurs in our experiments for frequent item-  sets.

Moreover, we denote two different behaviors of the ?dis-  tance? between the two borders. For Chess, Pumsb and  T10I4D100K (Figure 1), the borders distributions are very close, i.e. the mean of the negative border curve is only a  few levels before the mean of the positive border curve. The  dataset T10I4D100K is different from the two others since its borders are made of small itemsets.

For datasets Connect, Pumsb? and Mushroom in Fig- ure 1, a larger distance between the borders exists.

These simple observations will be used as predictors of  the hardness of a dataset in the sequel.

Stability of borders distribution Now, we study the vari-  ation of minimum support threshold values on borders dis-  tribution of frequent itemsets. To do that, we consider  Chess and Connect for the following minimum support  threshold values: 30%, 50% and 80%. For the first min-  imum support threshold value, the results are in Figure 1  and for the two others, in Figure 2.

A surprising observation is that the relative position of  borders distributions is stable w.r.t. variation of minimum  support threshold values.

Borders of frequent itemsets with a  different minimum support threshold  In other words, this observation suggests a kind of global  structure for frequent itemsets borders distribution invariant  to variation of minimum support threshold values.

Borders of concise representations Now, we consider  the positive and negative borders of frequent free itemsets  and frequent essential itemsets on Chess and Connect  given in Figure 3 and 4.

From these two figures, one can remark that distributions  of the two borders look like ?bell curves?. Recall that the  same behavior has already been pointed out for frequent  itemsets, suggesting that such kind of curves is almost in-  dependent of the considered anti-monotone predicate.

Moreover, the distance between the mean of the negative  and positive borders appears to be small for each concise  representation.

The same behavior has been observed in all our experi-  ments [16].

Borders of frequent free itemsets  3.4 Impact on algorithms performances  We focus on the discovery of maximal frequent item-  sets, and we study the performances of implementations  available at the FIMI website [18]. Let us consider results   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  F re  q u en  cy  Length  Chess (minsup 30%)  Bd-(FEI) Bd+(FEI)         1  2  3  4  F re  q u en  cy  Length  Connect (minsup 30%)  Bd-(FEI) Bd+(FEI)  Figure 4. Borders of frequent essential item-  sets  given in Figure 5 showing algorithms execution times on  four datasets.

On Chess dataset, for every implementation given in  Figure 5 (upper-left corner), algorithms execution times  increase exponentially with decreasing minimum support  threshold values, whereas for Connect (upper-right corner)  they appear to be almost linear for Mafia [9], fp ? zhu [21], LCM [36] and afopt [26]. Moreover, recall that  Connect has more and longer transactions, and more items  than Chess.

The same kind of behavior can be noticed for datasets  such as Pumsb and Pumsb? (Figure 5). These two datasets are very similar w.r.t. the transactions and num-  ber of items, but their borders distribution is very different  (Figure 1). Algorithms for Pumsb? are still very effec- tive for very low minimum support threshold, whereas for  Pumsb, algorithms do not perform very well for relatively  high minimum support threshold values.

Therefore, we deduce that pruning strategies are much  more efficient on datasets having a ?large? distance between  their positive and negative borders.

A possible explanation could be obtained by looking at  algorithms pruning strategies since most of them take ad-  vantage of minimal unfrequent itemsets to find maximal fre-  quent itemsets and prune the search space.

4 Toward new classifications  Observations described in previous section lead us to de-  vise a new classification for datasets w.r.t. borders distribu-  tion. We also intent to use these results for other data mining  problems, i.e. those problems said to be ?representable as  sets? [30].

4.1 A new dataset classification  This new classification differs from the classification  given in [20] since it takes into account both the negative  border and the positive border of frequent itemsets.

Algorithms performances  This classification follows from remarks done in the pre-  vious section. Its main interests are:  ? a better correspondence between algorithms perfor- mances and the classification. In other words, this  classification is a first attempt in order to evaluate the  ?hardness? of a dataset.

? a stability w.r.t. the variation of minimum support threshold.

Based on the ?distance? between positive and negative  borders distributions of frequent itemsets, different types of  datasets have been identified. As a consequence, we intro-  duce a new classification of datasets made of three types:  ? Type I datasets are datasets where borders distributions are very close, i.e. the mean of the negative border  curve is not far from the mean of the positive border  curve. In other words, most of the itemsets in the two  borders have approximately the same size. Chess and  Pumsb fall into this category; such datasets can be  expected to be hard for frequent itemsets mining.

? Type II datasets are datasets where there is a large dis- tance between the two borders distributions. In other  words, the itemsets in the negative border are much  smaller than those of the positive border. Connect,  Pumsb? and Mushroom fall into this category; in practice this type is easier than the previous one.

? Type III is a very special case of type I: the two dis- tributions are very close, but they are concentrated in  very low levels. This type allows to catch the notion of  sparseness (for example T10I4D100K). It might be the most easy dataset type in practice.

This classification is simpler than the one presented in  [20], while being very stable w.r.t. variation of minimum  support threshold. In addition to classical characteristics  of datasets, the ?distance? between the mean of the nega-  tive and positive border distributions makes possible a bet-  ter evaluation of the difficulty of a dataset.

For the two other concise representations previously de-  scribed, this classification suggests that almost all datasets  belong to type I or III.

4.2 Predicate classification  In the setting of this paper, we focus our analysis on  datasets with respect to frequent itemsets. In our experi-  ments, we studied three anti-monotone predicates, one for  frequent itemsets, another one for frequent free itemsets  and the last one for frequent essential itemsets. These  three predicates exhibit very different behaviors on the same  datasets (see Figure 1 to 4 on Connect and Chess for dif-  ferent minimum support threshold values).

Quite clearly, this work could be generalized to other  data mining problems, i.e. those which are representable  as sets [30]. We argue that the study of both positive and  negative borders for a given anti-monotone predicate may  allow us to come up with some general results.

From the previous sections, we deduced that studying the      R[XY ] ? S[UV ] R[XZ] ? S[UW ] ? R[XY Z] ? S[UV W ]  S : U ? V  Figure 6. An interaction between FD and IND  gap between the negative and positive borders may be very  insightful to explain the behavior of algorithms and may  also give some hints to guess the existence of properties as-  sociated with anti-monotone predicates. In spite of the huge  amount of work done for frequent itemset mining, we are  not aware of such kind of contributions. Nevertheless, we  introduce in the sequel another data mining problem known  to be representable as sets where such properties have been  clearly identified [15].

Application to inclusion dependency mining Inclusion  dependencies (IND) are fundamental semantic constraints  for relational databases [28]. Let r and s be two relations  over schemas R and S, and X and Y be sequences of at-  tributes into R and S respectively. The IND R[X] ? S[Y ] is true in (r, s) if all the values of X in r are also values of Y in s. This notion generalizes foreign keys constraints,  very popular in practice.

The underlying data mining problem can be stated as fol-  lows: ?Given a database, find all inclusion dependencies  satisfied in this database? [23, 30, 24, 15]. From [30], the set  of IND candidates can be organized in a levelwise manner; a  given level, say k, corresponds to INDs whose arity is equal  to k. Moreover, a partial order for INDs can be defined as  follows: if i and j are two INDs, j ? i if j can be obtained by performing the same projection on the two sides of i.

For example, R[AB] ? S[EF ] ? R[ABC] ? S[EFG].

In this setting, the predicate ?being satisfied in a database?  is anti-monotone with respect to ? [30].

Consider now the well known inference rule for inclu-  sion dependencies together with functional dependencies  [14] given in Figure 6. Intuitively, consider an inclusion  dependency i = R[XAB] ? S[Y EF ] where X and Y are attribute sequences and A, B, E and F are single attributes.

Suppose that every IND j such that j ? i is satisfied, and let j1 = R[XA] ? S[Y E] and j2 = R[XB] ? S[Y F ] be two of them. The more |Y | is large, the more Y is likely to determine E or F . In other words, i is likely to be satisfied  (from inference rule of Figure 6).

From this result, one may logically expect that large  INDs should never appear in the negative border, even if  large INDs exist. It implies a potentially large gap between  the two borders distribution, like for type II datasets for fre-  quent itemsets.

All our experiments corroborate this hypothesis; We  tested three synthetic databases built using the chase pro-  cedure [6]. We enforced large INDs in their positive border,  until size 18. For all databases, INDs in the negative border  were all of size lower than 3.

This particular behavior of the positive border of INDs  justifies an algorithm based on the negative border discov-  ery [15].

5 Conclusion and perspectives  In this paper, we have thoroughly studied datasets for  problems related to frequent itemset mining. We have  shown that the distribution of the negative and positive bor-  ders have an important impact on datasets classification and  algorithms performances. For frequent itemsets mining, a  new classification of datasets has been proposed. This work  is a first step toward a better understanding of the behavior  of algorithms with respect to the search space to be discov-  ered.

This work has two main perspectives. The former is to  find out theoretical foundation of ?bell curves? and stability  obtained for the distributions in most of our experiments.

The latter is the design of adaptive algorithms with respect  to dataset characteristics, i.e. changing dynamically their  strategy during runtime.
