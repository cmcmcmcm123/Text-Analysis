PROGRAMMABLE ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS IN SAFETY RELATED LIFT APPLICATIONS  S. K. MATHUR  Dewhurst plc, UK  scmE With the advent of Programmable Electronic Systems(PESs)in safety related lift systems, need has arisen to clarify those areas covered by the Safety Rules for the Construction of Lifts (162) where PESS may or may not, be applied. This paper is based on the guidelines prepared by the National Association of Lift Makers under the chairmanship of the writer.

Theguidanceapplies ifoneormoreofthe safety related systems associated with a plant is a PES. It does not apply if an adequate level of safety is assured by one or more conventional systems, separate from the controlling PES, of conventional safety integrity or better. The conventional system will need to adequately cater for, amongstotherthings, failures ofthe controlling PES itself.

GENERAL  APES is a computer-basedsystemwhich controls, protects or monitors the operation of plant or machinery, it is made up of both hardware and software and is linked to the plant by sensors and actuators.

When evaluating safety it is important to realise that PESS are fundamentally different from conventional control systems. For example, it is not always easy to predict the effect of the failure of a PES, or even to discover where the fault lies. PESs may be used to control or monitor safety circuits but should not be used to fulfil the function of a safety contact such as those listed in Appendix A of references (162).

Very often computer controlled lift equipment is installed in place of conventional systems.

In these cases, as a general guiding principle, the new systems should be at least as safe as the conventional one. However, as technology develops, there may not be a conventional equivalent and these guidelines combine sound lift engineering practice with the Health and Safety Executive recommendations of references (3b4)  toachievea satisfactory levelof safety.

PESs can be used in a variety of ways and the consequences of failure may range from inconvenience to a dangerous situation. The safety measures adopted must be appropriate to theparticularapplicationandthedegreeofthe safety strategy needed will depend upon the level of hazard presented.

WherePESs performa safety functionthey should be so designed that a combined failure or malfunction of hardware and software cannot reduce the level of safety integrity.

When a new installation is being designed, or the s a f e t y o f a n e x i s t i n g o n e i s b e i n g a s s e s s e d , it is essential to follow the following five logical and systematic steps to make sure that adequate safety precautions have been taken.

The correct procedure to follow is shown as a flow chart in Appendix 1.

Sten A -  The first stage i n  any safety assessment is to identify thehazards, i.e. dangerous situations in which people are likely to be injured, and then find the chain of events that could lead to these hazards. This analysis has already been carried out for lifts and has resulted in a set of safety rules for electricandhydraulic lifts as covered by references ( l h 2 )  respectively.

SteD B - Ide- of the Safetv-Related . .  . - From the hazard analysis it is possible to identify the safety systems and decide whether they fall within the scope of this paper, bearing in mind that a safety related system is one upon which the safety integrity of the lift is to be assured. These systems can broadly be divided into two types - control systems and protection systems.

When attempting to identify a safety related system it is important to note that although the breakdown of a programmable electronic control system might itself be part of a chain of events leading to a hazard, if it is effectively protected by a separate system which prevents the hazard arising, then the control system is not safety related and therefore does not have to comply with these guidelines.

To assist in identifying safety related systems, Appendix 2 covers some ofthe potential hazards identified and some of the protection systems recommended in (1). Column 3 gives examples of how the use of a PES would make the application of these guidelines relevant.

v A safety analysis has already been carried out for lifts in references ( l h 2 )  and the safety criteriahasbeenestabl ished.  This falls under three categories, examples of which are indicated in column 4 of Appendix 2 .

All electric safety devices covered in Appendix A of references (1&2) which are defined as Qafetv c o w  only and which satisfy 14.1.2.2. PESs are not permitted for this category.

All electric safety devices covered in Appendix A of references ( l h 2 )  which are defined as ' ' and which satisfy 14.1.2.3. PESs can be used but the guidelines to use are those specified by HSSE for high reliability circuits in their publication 'Programmable Electronic Systems in Safety RelatedApplications Part 2 -General Technical Guidelines' ( 4 ) .

GateaorvC, Allother safety relatedconditions not covered by Category A or B above but protected by an electric device. PESS can be used provided they comply with the design guidelines which involve improving three fundamental aspects of an installation, the configuration, reliability and quality. These are described in detail below in Step D.

Stev D - Desian of the Safety-Wated Svstem  Confiouration. Three principles must be satisfied to provide an acceptable design and assessment strategy. These are:  The combined number of PES and non-PES safety related systems which are capable, independently, of maintaining the lift in a safe state or of bringing the lift to a safe state when required should not be less than the number of conventional systems which have provided conventional safety integrity; and No failure, randomorsystematicofa single channel of progranunable electronics hardware should cause a dangerous mode of failure of the total configuration of safety related systems. It should be recognised that systematic hardware failures may affect all identical designs of programmable electronics; and Faults within the software associated with a single channel of programmable electronics shouldnotcauseadangerousmodeof failure of the total configuration of safety related systems. It shouldbe assumedthat a software fault will affect all identical software.

These guidelines assume that the configuration of the relevant circuitry is covered by one of the following:  Non PES control systems protected by a PES circuit.

PES control system monitored by one or more PESs eachtotally independent oftheother.

Hardware R- ~ l l  PESS used in either the control systemor protection circuitrymust satisfy a qualitative appraisal using engineering judgenent. Aspects of the programnable electronics which should be considered are:  The extent to which the programmable electronics are usedtomonitorthe correct operation of critical items such as sensors and actuators using, for example, signal validity checks designed into the applications software.

The extent andeffectiveness of measure sto ensure that critical failures of the programmable electronics do not remain unrevealed. Such measures include:  sum checks or other means of detecting corruption of program or data stored in Read Only Memory (ROM).

bit pattern tests or other means Of testing the correct functioning of Readhrite Memory (RAM).

watchdog timer to detect program halt or loop conditions.

power supply monitor to detect incipient failure.

The effectiveness of the means by which safety is maintained on detection of a failure, either automatically or by alarms and operator response.

the testing provisions of critical elements notnecessarilycoveredby (a) and (b) above including in particular the proof check intervals for the item in question.

the predominant failure modes.

the complexity and relative reliability Of the hardware.

the adherence to applicable systems which may specify hardware failure criteria such as, for example, that no single failure should result in an unsafe condition.

the degree of redundancy of all parts of the programmable electronics.

SQftware Rellabllltv. The necessary phases of a software development will vary according to the systembut, typically, the following phases should be carried out to reflect high quality and good reliability of the software.

(a) Requirements specification (b) Software specification (c) Software design (d) Software coding (e) Software test (f) System test  All aspects of software production and change should only be carried out by authorised and competent personnel. Each phase ofthe software development program should be documented sufficiently in order to:  . . .

Allow adequate communication between all participants in the design program.

Allow the design to be reviewed with agreed milestones as it proceeds.

Allow each stage in the design tobe checked and approved on completion.

Allow the operation of the software to be fully understood in the future.

Allow changes to be incorporated in a controlled manner.

Allow the full implications of changes to be evaluated.

Clearly define the software being used on site.

Oualitv. The minimum level of overall quality saiety related systems is specified-in (ai (b) as follows:  The programmable electronics shouldbemanufacturedusingan established quality assurance system, such as BS 5750. Other parts of the PES should be to a level of quality not inferior to conventional safety integrity; and  The safety related systems, particularly those that are PES based, should be engineered by competentandexperiencedpeoplewhounder- stand PES safety engineered principles related to lift systems.

S b s ~  E - sa- Once the design has been completed an analysis should be carried out to ensure that the required level of safety integrity for the safety related systems has been achieved. The analysis must extend to all those components, of safety related systems, whose failure could cause the safety related systems themselves to fail and affect the safety of the lift installation.

The analysis must cover all three system elements of configuration, reliability and overall quality and therefore confirm that the requirements listed under safety categories B and C.

P  The design of the equipment, and the components used, must be suitable for the ambient temperature in which they are to work, there must be due regard for the temperature riseoftheequipmentitself andthe temperature under which the equipment may be stored and transported.

The equipment must be protected from the effects of humidity during storage and operation, and particularly where there is a poss ib i l i tyof insta l lat ionbeingundertakenin initially unheated buildings.

. .

A Due consideration must be given, including during storage and transport, where the environment is suchtheremightbedust, corrosiveorexplosive atmospheres, and the design needs to take these into account.

e - E- Electrical and electro-magnetic interference has four possible sources, it may be:  (a) Mains borne (b) Generated by the lift control system (c) Generated by the PES itself (d) Radiated from external sources  Interference such as spikes, surges and dips, flicker, harmonics and transients from these sources must not affect the PES in any way that reduces the level of safety.

The equipment should be designed using sound engineeringpractice. Due consideration should begiventothequal i tyofpower supplies, logic andmains, along with earthbonding, screening, de-coupling, avoidance of earth loops and segregation of power/signal cables.

Any suppression and filtering necessary to ensure correct operation of the PES, in order to achieve the required safety criteria, should be documented. This is to guard against the possibility of the suppression devices being removed or changed during the life of the equipment.

Wectro-Static Dis-sD) Dam- Many devices used in electronic systens are susceptible to ESD damage. This damage is not necessarily destructive or immediately apparent, but can lead to intermittent faults or degraded performance.

Steps should be taken during manufacture, storage, transport and installation of the equipmenttominimise risk and provide guidance on correct handling procedures.

. .

rv Devices, Adequate precautions should be taken to safeguard against the effects of X-rays and ultra-violet light radiation.

Software for safety relatedapplications should be of a high quality to ensure reliable operation throughout its life. Qualitymust be considered fromthe outset to make certain that Software is correctly specified, designed, documented, tested and controlled.

Adjustments to equipment operation parameters (e.g. door dwell times) on site using hardware jumpers, pinboard, switches etc. must be fully documented if they affect software functions.

Records shouldbekepton siteandat theoffices of manufacturers and/or service organisations.
