I. INTRODUCTION Association rule mining is to discover all association rules  among itemsets in a given database, where the supports and confidences of these association rules must satisfy the user- specified minimum support and minimum confidence. This task  is usually decomposed into two steps: (1) Generate all itemsets that exceed the minimum support; (2) Construct all association rules that satisfy minimum confidence from the frequent itemsets in step one.

In a variety of data mining problems, mining frequent item is the basic process but also a key step [1] . Frequent item min- ing has been extensively used in association rule mining [2][3][4] . The goal of frequent itemset mining is to discover all the item- sets whose supports in the database exceed a user-specified threshold. However, frequent itemset mining algorithms often generate plenty of frequent itemsets and rules.In these associa- tion rules, often only a small part of the user concerned. Users can not very intuitive to find that the focus of mining and val- uable rule has been overshadowed by a large number of invalidrule.

But for a frequent itemsets that length is L, there are 2 -1L frequent subset. When L is very large, mining all the frequent itemsets is much difficult. As the maximal frequent itemsets has been implied all the frequent itemsets, and many data min- ing applications need only mining maximum frequent itemsets instead of mining all the frequent itemsets, So which in recent years, many people have embarked on researching for maxim- al frequent itemsets mining [5][6] .

At present mining maximum frequent itemsets algorithm is mainly based on improved algorithm for Apriori [7]  or FP- growth [8] algorithm. Apriori-based algorithms need to repeat- edly scan data sets, and will produce a large number of candi- date item set. Although the FP-growth algorithms do not gen- erate candidates, but the FP-tree construction and traversal affecting the efficiency of FP-growth algorithm is the bottle- neck. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of mining tasks, constraint-based mining enables users to concentrate on mining their interested association rules instead of the comp- lete set of association rules. this paper presents a fast constraint-based algorithm for mining maximal frequent item- sets,which is based on Eclat algorithm and can solve the lack of constrained frequent itemsets algorithm in mining long pattern and intensive database.

The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2, a brief description about Edat algorithm and constr- ained association rule mining theory is explained. The next section introduces our new detailed method. Following section we conduct a series of experiments to show the efficiency and scalability of our proposed algorithms. Conclusions is presen- ted in last section.



II. PROBLEM    STATEMENT  A. Edat algorithm [9] Edat algorithm uses a vertical database structure.Vertical  tid-list of the database refers each  record of database that cons- titutes by a project and its all ever appeared transaction-records list. So that the support degree for any frequent set can obtaine- de  through a number of tid-hst intersection operations. Table 1 is a example of transaction database, table 2 is its tid-list of the sample database.

Edat algorithm can be summarized into the following two steps: First, find out all frequent 1-itemsets and frequent 2-item sets(as atoms). Second, the search space (concept lattice) is divided into smaller sub-spacethe(sub-concept lattice) by use of the equivalence relations,and each sub-concept lattice generates independently frequent itemsets. It scans the database only two times and calculate the support by use of cross-operation, which has achieved good results in practice.

B. Constrained association rule mining theory Many constraint-based frequent itemset discovery techni-  ques have been proposed recently for various constraint mod- els. These constraints include the types of knowledge constra- ints, data constraints, dimension / level constraints, interests degree constraints and rule-bound, etc. Depending on the app- lication of the actual requirements, the most useful constraints is item constraint, that is, mining the maximum frequents that contain a project (or contain a number of items) . Item constr- aints in frequent itemset mining were first discussed in Srikant et al. (1997), which considered the problem of integrating constraints that are Boolean expressions over the presence or absence of items into the association rule discovery algorithms.

Definition 1. A constraint B is a predicate on the powerset of the  set of items I , i.e., B : 2I ?{true, false}. An itemset X satisfies a constraint B if and only if B(X)is true. The comple- te  set of itemsets satisfying a constraint B is BSAT (I) {X I | X satisfying B}= ? .

Definition 2. For item sets X I? , X?support degree expresses as X_support, and min_support as a given minimum support.

If X._support?min_support,and Y_support< min_support (for any Y X? ),then claimed X was the largest frequent item- set.

Note that if any superset of a frequent X is infrequent then the X is maximum frequent.

Definition 3. For the maximum frequent itemsets X I? , if X satisfy the constraint B, then X is constrained maximum frequ- ent itemsets.

Theorem 1. For any item set X? I, if X satisfy the constraints B then any superset Y of X must satisfy the constraints B.

Proof: Since X satisfy the constraints B , there exists jB ?B (j=1,2,?,n)makes jB X? .That is, any superset of X contains  jB .Therefore, theorem 1 is proved.

Corollary 1. For any frequent item set constraints X? I, there is constrained maximum frequent itemset Y?X.

Note that any constrained-frequent itemset must be a sub- set of the largest frequent itemsets.So,founding frequent item- sets can be turned into the problem that discover constrained maximum frequent itemset.

To introduce constraint into the Eclat algorithm, it is nec- essary to sort items of the database. After introduction of con- straints, we will need to re-sort for the items when mining B?maximal frequent itemsets that satisfy constraint iB .First order B: when iB  has iij? , put iij? on the front of the conjunc- tion items iB ; Then sort the items of I: put the m projects in  iB as m items of I  in front. The enumeration tree of diction- ary sequence subset sort the items by dictionary order way.So it ensure that each itemset expression is the only ,which  de- fine the node hierarchical-expansion structure using inclusion relationa between the subsets.

Pruning strategy:Application IEP algorithm(Itemset Ext - ension Pruning Strategy ) [10]  prun search space,which can im- prove the algorithm performance.

Theorem 2. Assume that B is a item constraint.The maximal frequent itemsets can be obtained to satisfy the constraints ,by solving maximal frequent itemsets that satisfy each disjunct- ion item.

Theorem 3 The maximal frequent itemsets,which meet every item B, must be in the equivalence class of the disjunctive item.If B has m disjunctive items, maximal frequent itemsets must be in topmost equivalence class of P(I m ).

Theorem 2 and theorem 3 tells us that the item constraint B can be broken down to the corresponding equivalence class according to disjunctive items,which is the core of dealing with constraints. The sorting operation ensure that Bi of B?dis- junction stands in the presence of the equivalence classes. So through these major equivalence  constrainting, the efficiency of algorithm can be greatly improved. Eclat adopts by top- down enumeration algorithm, and finds out all the equivalence class by recur to enumerate intersection of each atomitem.

Because we just want to mine the maximal frequent itemsets that satisfing the constraint, so we will discuss how to divide the equivalence classes so that improve the mining speed.

Comparing with the previously proposed methods, the more representative is Separate algorithm [11] ,which generates less candidate sets. In Separate algorithm, the idea of Apriori algorithm is used to generates candidate sets and frequent item sets layer by layer. As the constraints of accession, Separate can directly generate candidate sets that meet the constraints B. According to the different constraint length,algorithm can gen- erate effectively the frequent itemsets of satisfy user specified constraints.However,due to Separate algorithm follows the conceptual framework of Apriori algorithm ,therefore, it foll- owed the Apriori algorithm disadvantages.That is, it not only generates a large of frequent itemsets but also repeatedly scan the database;As stated in? 11? ,Separate algorithm also has important shortcomings that does?t prune candidate sets and produces a lot of useless calculations.



III. MINING  ALGORITHM In this section, we propose Eclat_FCMFS algorithm to  obtain maximum frequent itemsets  that satisfy the constraint B.On the specific constraints,the algorithm uses depth-first str-         ategy and effective pruning method to mine rapidly maximum frequent.

Symbol  definition: (1) Let constraints B? 1 2 kB B B? ? ? ?each of iB  has the form  as following: i1 i2 imk k k? ? ? ? ij Ik ? ? (2)set-of- iB : It expressed  the set form of iB  shaped like as  { i1 i2 im,k , ,k k } in the B? (3) BiL ?frequent itemsets in the iB ? The proposed algorithm consists of three phases: Phase1: Scan the database once and get frequent 1 ? itemsets; Phase2. According to disjunctive item i i1 i2 ijB k k k= ? ? ? ,  Sort order the item set I,and mine maximal frequent itemsets in equivalence class { i1 i2 im,k , ,k k };  Phase3.Find out the union set of all maximal frequent itemsets.

Input: Given a transactional database T,a min_support and a constraints B? 1 2 kB B B? ? ? ,  Output: The Max-frequent itemsets satisfying  B.

Method:Call Eclat_FCMFS algorithm 1. Scan the database once and get frequent 1 ? itemsets 1L ; 2.For each iB  perform Eclat_FCMFS( iB );  3. L=  k  i i  L? =  ?

Bi Bi tL L Y= ? ?? 29?Return BiL  From above we can see that Eclat_FCMFS algorithm is searched out from the equivalence classes that meeting small- est frequent itemset iB . In Eclat_FCMFS algorithm, by large equivalence classes of atoms,  all  frequent  sets that meet  dis- junction are obtained. In the function Eclat_FCMFS ( iB ), it cuts invalid candidate pattern and comes into directly the next cycle when the pruning condition 17), 18) is satisfied. Thus it can  save greatly computing time;When the condition 20), 21) is satisfied, it will be merged into the next one set to dynamic- ally reduce the number of cycles; When the condition 24) is satisfied, the consolidation-item R will replace the original tY , and thereby accelerating speed of item consolidation and sav- ing  computing tim. Furthermore, since the algorithm based on the Eclat algorithm  we only need to access the database can be twice, which greatly saves the time spent on accessing the database with regard to the time spent.



IV.    EXPERIMENTS AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION Separate algorithm is one of more efficient and classic  algorithms in the current mining frequent itemsets . In order to illustrate the performance of the Eclat_FCMFS algorithm,we compare it with the Separate algorithm.

We conducted some experiments to evaluate efficiency of our algorithms. These algorithms were implemented using C++ language and tested on a PC with a single Intel Pentium IV 80G processor and 512MB main memory using the Windows XP operating system. Experimental data sets using literature data on method of synthesis of [5]. We use V25F20- T50KN1KL100 to represent the default setting where the average size of the transactions is 25, the average size of the maximal potentially frequent itemsets is 20, the number of transactions is 50K, the number of items is 1K, and  the num- ber of maximal potentially frequent itemsets is 100.

To test the effect of a constraint on mining frequent item- sets, the selectivity? of a constraint B is defined as follow:  Number of frequent itemsets not satisfying Number of frequent itemsets  B ? = .

Consequently, a constraint with 0% selectivity means every frequent itemset satisfies the constraint, while with100%, selectivity means every frequent itemset violates the constraint.

A.  Mining time-varying conditions as the number of transactions increasing.

In the first experiment, we wanted to investigate how run time changes as the transaction size vary. Therefore, we first set the minimum confidence at 0.5%, the constraint selective bind to take ? =20% and ? = 80% respectively. It is obvious from Fig.1 that the run time of both  Eclat_FCMFS and Separate algorithms increases as the number of transactions increases, and the excavation time is linear growth in each case.We can also observe that when ? = 20% ,Eclat_FCMFS         algorithm for mining time is more longer than that when ? = 80%;When ? = 20%, mining time of Eclat_FCMFS algo- rithm? is close to the  that of Separate algorithms. When ? = 80%, Eclat_FCMFS algorithm for mining time is far less than that of  Separate algorithm. This is because that Separate algo- rithm is based on the idea of Apriori algorithm. When the con- straint selectivity is large, Separate algorithm requires contin- uous access to the database and produces a large number of candidate sets, which greatly increased the time of excavation.

Eclat_FCMFS algorithm in these two areas significantly re- duced the excavation time through the use of effective strate- gies.

Fig.1 Effect of the number of transactions         20K 40K 60K 80K 100K  Number of transaction in database  M i n i n g  ti m e ( s )  Separate(20%)  Eclat_FCMFS(20%)  Separate(80%)  Eclat_FCMFS(80%)   B. Mining time-varying as the constraint selectivity  increasing.

The  minimum support sets 0.5%.  Fig. 2 shows how  the  Eclat_FCMFS and Separate  algorithms changes as the constr- aint selectivity increases from 0% to100%. We can see that the execution time of the Eclat_FCMFS and Separate algorithm decreases as the constraint selectivity increases. But when ? = 15%, Eclat_FCMFS mining algorithm is 40-50% times faster than the Separate algorithms. As the constraint selectivity incr- eases,  i.e.,  more frequent itemsets violate the constraint,  the Eclat_FCMFS algorithm can prune more search space.

When the constraint selectivity is smaller, Eclat_FCMFS mining time is far less than the Separate algorithm.With the increase in selective constraint, Separate mining time  gradua- lly approximate the mining time of Eclat_FCMFS algori- thm.This is due to the number of mining frequent itemsets will be subsequently increased with decrease of the constraint, then it will dig out a large number of long frequent pattern. There- fore, for the database-intensive digging, the performance of the Eclat_FCMFS algorithm is better than Separate algorithm.

C. Mining time-varying conditions as the minimum support threshold.

In this section, we wanted to investigate how run time changes as the minimum support value. The experiments are performed over the dataset with the default settings and the constraint selectivity? = 20% and ? = 80% respectively. Fig.3 shows how the Eclat_FCMFS and Separate algorithms chan- ges as the minimum support threshold increases from 0.25% to 2%. In Fig.3, as the minimum support threshold increases,  Fig.2 effect of the constraint selectivity         0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%  Constraint Selectivity  M i n i n g t i m e ( s )  Separate  Eclat_FCMFS  the execution time of all algorithms decreases because of the reduction in the number of frequent itemsets. This is because as the minimum support decreases the mining frequent item- sets is also reduced, so can dig out the a large number of  long pattern frequent itemset.

We can also observe that when ?  = 20% the mining-time of Eclat_FCMFS algorithm is more longer than that when ?= 80%, which is due to the frequent itemsets generate very little when selective constraints is larger. Therefore, the algorithm excavation time will be very few.

V.     CONCLUSION Frequent itemset mining is one of the fundamental data  mining problems in numerous studies. Constraint-based mining enables users to provide restraints on mining their interested association rules and can greatly improve the efficiency of mining tasks.In this paper, we first  introduces the concept, theories and correlational algorithms of constrained association rules, then propose a fast constraint-based algorithm for mining maximal frequent itemsets. As Separate algorithm?s correctness and effectiveness have been proved by Cui Lixin and other scholars [15] .Therefore, this paper comparison Eclat_FCMFS algorithm with Separate algorithm in  aspect of  the number of transactions, minimum support and constraint length. The experimental results show that Eclat_FCMFS algorithm is very effective and can solve the lack of constrained frequent itemsets algorithm in mining long pattern and intensive database.
