An Electro-Optical Tracking Method in Target Separation Based on Fuzzy  Clustering Association Rules

Abstract-An effective tracking method is proposed to solve the problem that the electro-optical tracking system in  Missile Range easily loses the real target during the target  separation. Before target separation, the error correcting  value of the theoretical trajectory is obtained by the  theoretical trajectory correcting algorithm. In the phase of  target separation, the theoretical trajectory of the target is  corrected by the error correcting value firstly, and then the  fuzzy clustering association algorithm is applied to calculate  the similarity between the measuring data of the target from  sensors and the corrected theoretical trajectory. The  similarity helps to identify whether the measured data is  from the real target or not. Experimental results show that  the authenticity of the target can be determined effectively.

The identified results can be used as the decision-making  basis of the servo sub-system and TV trackers, which can  improve the continuous tracking probability of the  electro-optical tracking system in the target separation.

INTRODUCTION  The measurement of target separation features is one of the important missions in the Missile Range to the electro-optical tracking system, which can provide the visual image, ballistic information and profile characteristics of the target through the optical sensors (usual TV and Infrared). However, the imaging features of the target are usually complicated in the phase of target separation. A single target often splits into multiple sub-targets, which greatly disturb the identification of the real target and easily lead to track the wrong target after target separation. So it is important to research how to track the real target steadily in target separation.

In the electro-optical tracking system, the TV trackers and the servo sub-system are two important sub-systems to realize the target tracking. The TV trackers distinguish the target and calculate the miss-distances of the target for the servo sub-system, which employs the data to control the pedestal to track the target automatically. Three techniques commonly used in the TV trackers to distinguish the target: Edge, Centroid and Correlation identifYing algorithm. The edge identifYing algorithm can distinguish the edge point of the target along the setting edge direction. The centroid identifYing algorithm can calculates the centroid point of the target by the horizontal   WU Y ong-jun3 3. Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center  Taiyuan, China  and vertical coordinate data of the digitized video signal.

The correlation identifYing algorithm uses a pattern matching technique in distinguishing the target from the cluttered background. Nevertheless, the actual application shows that there are many limitations for these algorithms to identifY the real target in target separation, and the continuous tracking probability is low. It is difficult to meet the tracking needs of increasingly complicated target.

In modem Missile Range, the theoretical trajectory of the target is the significant information to the electro-optical tracking system, but it usually has great deviation from the real. In the paper, a new tracking method is presented to improve the tracking capability in target separation. Through the theoretical trajectory correcting algorithm, the corrected theoretical trajectory of target will close to the real trajectory, and it is used as the reference to judge whether the miss-distances of the target from the TV trackers are about the real target. The judging algorithm is based on the fuzzy clustering association rules, and the result is informed to the servo system and the TV trackers. According to the result, the servo system can avoid using the wrong miss-distances of the target, and the TV trackers can determine whether to identifY other targets again. So the probability of continuous tracking in target separation is improved effectively.



II. PRINCIPLE OF TRACKING IN TARGET SEPARATION  It is the premise of automatic tracking in the electro-optical tracking system that the TV trackers should recognize the real target and then generate their own miss-distances. One of the miss-distances is selected artificially in the servo sub-system by the operative button to close the loop and drive the tracking mount to keep the target positioned at the system line-of-sight. Before target separation, the target is high contrast to the background in the electro-optical sensors, and it is easy for the TV trackers to identifY the target by the three identifYing algorithms and calculate the corresponding miss-distances.

The automatic tracking can be accomplished reliably in the servo sub-system by using the sole artificially selected miss-distance. However, in the phase of target separation, due to the existence of sub-targets, the TV trackers are difficult to distinguish the real target from the multiple sub-targets and the corresponding miss-distance may not be from the real target. If the servo sub-system still uses the previous selected miss-distance, it would fail tracking the real target. Figure I shows the case of an experimental target separation.

The case of experimental target separation  encoder  Actually, the theoretical trajectory of the target can be used by the electro-optical tracking system during the measuring of the target, but it is usually not precise because of all kinds of deviation in the target flight. Here a new technique is applied to improve the probability of successful tracking in the target separation. The theoretical trajectory is corrected firstly, and then is used to judge whether the miss-distances of the target from the TV trackers are similar to the real target. The tracking method in the phase of target separation is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Block diagram of tracking in the target separation  Before target separation, all the TV trackers identify the same target and generate the corresponding miss-distances. The target measuring position ?, can be  obtained by synthesizing the miss-distance of target with the encoder of tracking system, and then the state x, (k) and covariance matrix ?(k) of the target in the sample time k can be estimated by Kalman filtering and predicting. Through the covariance weight fusion, the fusing state X' (k) and the fusing covariance matrix p' (k) of the target are formed, which can be treated as the real state of target. At the same time, the theoretical state X'(k) and theoretical covariance matrix P'(k) of the target can be deduced by Kalman filtering the theoretical trajectory data. Comparing the fusing state X'(k) with the theoretical state X'(k) , the state correcting value (J" and the corrected theoretical state X(k) can be acquired by theoretical trajectory correction algorithm.

After target separation, the state estimation of target x, (k,) from various TV trackers may not reflect the state of the real target precisely, but the corrected  theoretical state X(k,) would be high associated with the 3W ,-?'h?eo=,e=.li c?a l?p=OS?itio?n?an=d?,e?a l?p=OS?itio?n  ==" ..... theoretical position(R_1 ,Q_1.44,T_1)  - real positlon(R-O.0009,Q-1.44,T-O.01)   320 ..

Thus the similarity between x, (k) and X(k) can be counted by the fuzzy clustering association algorithm, which shows whether the state x, (k,) is similar to the corrected theoretical state X(k ) . If the state X (k ) is  1 J 1  similar to the corrected theoretical state x, (k,), it means the TV tracker i has the high probability to recognize the real target. On the contrary, the TV tracker i would recognize the wrong target.



III. REALIZATION OF THEORETICAL TRAJECTORY CORRECTION  The theoretical trajectory of target usually deviates from the real moving trajectory because of various disturbances in the target flight. Comparing numerous trajectory data, it can be found that the deviation between the theoretical target state and the real target state changes slowly, as shown in Figure 3. The theoretical target state corrected by the deviation is close to the real state in the short target separating time.

Relations between the theoretical state and the real state of target     Assume that X"(k) is the theoretical state estimation in the sample time k, X'(k) is the fusion state estimation which approaches the real state before the target separating. Define the error coefficient as:  p(k) = [X'(k) - X"(k)t W[X'(k) - X"(k)] Where w is the weight coefficient matrix. If the error  coefficient is larger than the error threshold p, it indicates that the theoretical state estimation of target departs from the real state greatly and should be corrected.

The error coefficient is smaller in the initial and end segment, which shows the theoretical state estimation close to the real state. It is consistent with the movement state relationship in Figure 3, and this trend will not change with the change of the weight coefficient matrix w .

IV. REALIZATION OF FUZZY CLUSTERING ASSOCIA nON  The fuzzy clustering algorithm works in the target separating. The similarity between the state estimation of target from TV trackers and the corrected theoretical state of target is counted to judge whether the TV trackers indentify the real target. Assume there are two state estimations of target from two different sensors:  x, = [XI,X2,00?,x"t i=1,2 The corresponding resolution is:  D, = [61,6,,00?.6:f i=1,2 Assume the accuracy of the sensor 1 is higher than that  of sensor 2, then: DI(k) < D2(k) 'ltk=l, 2,00', n   The Euclidean distance between two states of target is defined as:  d' = {"X, - XJ II i"* j  '1 liD, II i =j According to the fuzzy means clustering algorithm, the  optimum membership {uij} is determined as:  U '1 'lti,j= 1,2 , d (?= ( ----.L  ) 2/(m-I)  ] h=1 dhJ  Where s is the total number of targets, m is an integer, u" is the resolution membership degree of sensor i (i=l, 2) , u" is the membership degree of the difference between the    two states x, and xj' The global association is decided according to the minimum accuracy sensors, then:  {I U12 > U22 T= 0 U12 < u22  When T= 1, it means two states of target are from the same target, whereas T=O means two states of target are from different targets.



V. EXPERIMENTS VERIFICATION AND RESULTS ANALYSIS  In order to verifY the algorithms, we assume there are two sensors (sensor 1 and sensor 2) in the electro-optical tracking system. According to the experimental trajectory in Figure 3, it is assumed that the real measured data is from sensor 1. Data from the sensor 2 is simulated by adding a slope signal B(t) = (t-15)*I(t-15) to the  real measured data after the time ISs, which analog the sensor 2 identifies a wrong target in target separation.

The  theoretical state of target is corrected after the target separating in the time k = 15 s .The membership degree calculated by fuzzy clustering algorithm is shown in Figure 6.

Calculated results of the fuzzy clustering association  For the sensor 1, the state estimation of target and the corrected theoretical state of target are correlated in the time k = 15-19 s, which suggests that there is a large probability to identifY the real target for the sensor 1 in target separation, and the tracking system has a reason to choose the data from the sensor 1 for tracking. For the sensor 2, the state estimation of target and the corrected theoretical state of target are not correlated from the time k = 16 s , which means there is a greater probability of tracking a false target for the sensor 2. The results suit to the above hypothesis.
