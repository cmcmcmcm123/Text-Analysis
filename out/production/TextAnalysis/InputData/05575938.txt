Incrementally Mining High Utility Itemsets in Dynamic Databases

Abstract   Utility mining is proposed to consider additional measures, such as profits or costs according to user preference. In the past, a two-phase mining algorithm was proposed for fast discovering high utility itemsets from databases. In this paper, an incremental mining algorithm to efficiently update high utility itemsets is proposed for record insertion. Experimental results also show that the proposed algorithm executes faster than the two-phase batch mining algorithm.

1. Introduction   Utility mining [3, 10] may be thought of as an expansion of frequent-itemset mining [1-2, 5] with sold quantities and item profits considered. Liu et al.

designed the two-phase algorithm [7] for efficiently extracting all high utility itemsets based on the downward-closure property. In the above approaches, the database was assumed static and the mining processes were performed in a batch way.

In real-world applications, transactions in a database do not usually remain a stable condition.

Some transactions may be inserted into an original database due to new purchases from customers [6, 9].

Cheung et al. then proposed the Fast-UPdate (FUP) algorithm [4] to solve the limitations of association- rule mining in an incremental approach.

In this paper, an incremental mining algorithm to update the discovered high utility itemsets is thus proposed. It is based on Liu et al.?s two-phase mining approach [7] and the FUP concept [4] to partition itemsets into four parts according to whether they are  high transaction-weighted utilization itemsets in the original database and in the new transactions. Each part is then executed by its own procedure. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a better performance than the two-phase batch mining algorithm.

2. Review of related works   In this section, the FUP algorithm and the concept of mining high utility itemsets are briefly reviewed.

2.1. The FUP algorithm   In real-world applications, transactions in a database do not usually remain a stable condition.

Considering an original database and some new transactions, the following four cases (illustrated in Figure 1) may occur.

Original database  New transactions  Large Itemsets  Small Itemsets  Large Itemsets  Small Itemsets  Case 1 Case 2  Case 3 Case 4   Figure 1. Four cases when new transactions are inserted into existing database   DOI 10.1109/GrC.2010.151     Since itemsets in Case 1 are frequent (large) in both the original database and the new transactions, they will still be frequent (large) after the weighted average of the counts. Similarly, itemsets in Case 4 will still be non-frequent (small) after the new transactions are inserted. Thus Cases 1 and 4 will not affect the final frequent (large) itemsets. Case 2 may remove existing frequent (large) itemsets, and Case 3 may add new frequent (large) itemsets.

2.2. Mining high utility itemsets   In the past, several mining algorithms were proposed for efficiently discovering high utility itemsets [3, 10]. Liu et al. then designed a two-phase algorithm for efficiently discovering all high utility itemsets [7]. It consists of two phases to generate-and- test high utility itemsets in a level-wise way. The transaction utility was first used as the effective upper bound of each candidate itemset in the transaction such that the ?transaction-weighted downward closure property? could be kept in the search space to decrease the number of candidate itemsets. An additional database scan was then performed to find out the real utility values of the remaining candidates and identifies the high utility itemsets.

3. The proposed incremental algorithm for record insertion   Considering there is an example to show the original database in Table 1. It consists of 10 transactions and 6 items, denoted {A} to {F}.

Table 1. An original database in the example  TID A B C D E F 1 3 2 0 3 0 0 2 2 0 0 4 2 0 3 3 0 5 0 0 3 4 1 0 3 0 1 2 5 1 0 0 3 2 0 6 1 2 0 4 0 0 7 2 3 2 0 1 1 8 0 0 0 0 0 2 9 0 0 3 3 0 0  10 3 0 0 4 0 0  Assume the minimum high utility threshold is set at  35%, and also assume the user-defined profit values for the items are given in a utility table shown in Table 2.

The two-phase algorithm is first performed to find high transaction-weighted utilization itemsets and their actual utility values before new transactions come. The results are then shown in Table 3.

Table 2. The utility table  Item Profit ($) A 3 B 150 C 1 D 50 E 100 F 20   Table 3. The high transaction-weighted utilization itemsets and their actual utility values  Itemset High transaction-weighted utility Actual utility  value A 2728 48 B 1540 1050 D 2083 1050 E 1483 600  AB 1540 1068 AD 1930 930 AE 1483 618   The details of the proposed incremental mining  algorithm are described below.

The proposed incremental algorithm: INPUT: An original database D, the discovered high  transaction-weighted utilization itemsets with their actual utility values from the original database, a minimum high utility count mucD (= total transaction utility  ? ?DT  k k  tu * minimum high utility threshold ? )  in the original database, and a set of d new transactions.

OUTPUT: A set of high utility itemsets (HUU) for the updated database U (= D d? ).

STEP 1: Calculate the utility value ujk of each item ij in each new transaction tk as ujk = qjk*pj, where qjk is the quantity of ij in tk and pj is the profit of pj. Accumulate the utility values all items in each transaction tk as the transaction utility tuk. That is:  .

m  k jk j  tu u =  =?  STEP 2: Calculate the minimum high utility count  mucd (= ? =  n  k ktu   * minimum high utility  threshold ? ) in the new transactions.

STEP 3: Set k = 1, where k records the number of  items in the itemsets s currently being processed.

STEP 4: Generate the candidate k-itemsets and calculate their transaction-weighted utilities twud(s) from the new transactions as the summation of the utilities of the new transactions which include ij. That is:  .)( ? ?  = kj ti  k d tustwu  STEP 5: Check whether the twud(s) of each k-itemset from the new transactions is larger than or equal to the minimum high utility count mucd in the new transactions. If s satisfied the condition, put it in the set of high transaction-weighted utilization k-itemsets for the new transactions, dkHTWU .

STEP 6: For each k-itemset s in the set of high transaction-weighted utilization k-itemsets ( DkHTWU ) from the original database, if it also appears in the set of high transaction- weighted utilization k-itemsets ( dkHTWU ) in the new transactions, do the following substeps (Case 1): Substep 6-1: Set the updated transaction- weighted utility of itemset s as:  twuU(s) = twuD(s) + twud(s), where twuD(s) is the high transaction- weighted utility of itemset s in the original database ( DkHTWU ) and twu  d(s) is the high transaction-weighted utility of itemset s in the new transactions )( dkHTWU , respectively.

Substep 6-2: Put s in the set of updated high transaction-weighted utilization k-itemsets,  U kHTWU .

STEP 7: For each k-itemset s in the set of high transaction-weighted utilization k-itemsets ( DkHTWU ) from the original database, if it does not appear in the set of high transaction-weighted utilization k-itemsets ( dkHTWU ) in the new transactions, do the following substeps (Case 2): Substep 7-1: Set the updated transaction- weighted utility of itemset s as:  twuU(s) = twuD(s) + twud(s).

Substep 7-2: Check whether the updated twuU(s) is larger than or equal to the updated minimum high utility count (mucD + mucd).

If s satisfied the above condition, put it in the set of updated high transaction-weighted utilization k-itemsets, UkHTWU ;  Otherwise, remove s from the set of high transaction-weighted utilization k-itemsets ( DkHTWU ) in the original database.

STEP 8: For each k-itemset s, if it does not appear in the set of high transaction-weighted utilization k-itemsets ( DkHTWU ) from the original database, but appears in the set of high transaction-weighted utilization k- itemsets )( dkHTWU  in the new transactions, do the following substeps (Case 3): Substep 8-1: Rescan the original database to determine the transaction-weighted utility twuD(s) of itemset s.

Substep 8-2: Set the updated transaction- weighted utility of itemset s as:  twuU(s) = twuD(s) + twud(s).

Substep 8-3: Check whether the updated transaction-weighted utility twuU(s) is larger than or equal to the updated minimum high utility count (mucD + mucd). If s satisfied the above condition, put it in the set of updated high transaction-weighted utilization k- itemsets, UkHTWU .

STEP 9: Generate the candidate (k+1)-itemsets from the set of high transaction-weighted utilization k-itemsets ( UkHTWU ) in the updated database.

STEP 10: Set k = k + 1; STEP 11: Repeat STEPs 4 to 10 until no new  candidate itemsets are generated.

STEP 12: For each high transaction-weighted  utilization itemset s in UHTWU  of the updated database, if it appears in the set of high transaction-weighted utilization itemsets in DHU of the original database, do the following substeps.

Substep 12-1: Calculate the actual utility value of each itemset s for the new transactions as:  ?? ? ?  = k jts si  jk d usau )( ,  where ujk is the utility value of each item ij in each new transaction tk.

Substep 12-2: Set the updated actual utility value of itemset s in the updated database as:  )()()( sausausau dDU += .

Substep 12-3: Check whether the actual utility value of itemset s is larger than or     equal to the updated minimum high utility count (mucD + mucd). If it satisfies the above condition, put it in the set of updated high utility itemsets, HUU.

STEP 13: For each high transaction-weighted utilization itemset s in UHTWU  of the updated database, if it does not appear in the set of high transaction-weighted utilization itemsets in DHU of the original database, do the following substeps.

Substep 13-1: Calculate the actual utility value of each itemset s for the new transactions as:  ?? ? ?  = k jts si  jk d usau )( .

Substep 13-2: Rescan the original database to determine the actual utility value auD(s).

Substep 13-3: Set the updated actual utility value of itemset s in the updated database as:  )()()( sausausau dDU += .

Substep 13-4: Check whether the actual utility value of itemset s is larger than or equal to the updated minimum high utility count (mucD + mucd). If it satisfies the above condition, put it in the set of updated high utility itemsets, HUU.

After STEP 13, the high utility itemsets for the  updated database can then be updated.

4. An example   In this section, the new transactions to be inserted are shown in Table 4.

Table 4. Five new transactions in the example TID A B C D E F 11 3 0 4 8 0 0 12 3 0 3 7 0 0 13 3 0 2 6 0 0 14 1 0 0 0 1 1 15 4 3 0 0 0 0   The original database and already discovered high  transaction-weighted utilization itemsets with their actual utility values were shown in Table 3. Assume the minimum high utility threshold is also set at 35%.

The proposed incremental algorithm for record insertion proceeds as follows.

STEP 1 & 2 & 3: The utility value of each item occurring in each new transaction in Table 4 is  calculated. The minimum high utility count in the new transactions is then calculated as (1671*0.35), which is 584.85. The variable k is first set to 1.

STEP 4 & 5: In this example, {A:1671}, {C:1086}, and {D:1086} are then put in the set of high transaction-weighted utilization 1-itemsets in the new transactions.

STEP 6: In this example, {A:4399} and {D:3169} are then put in the set of high transaction-weighted utilization 1-itemsets for the updated database.

STEP 7: In this example, only {B:2002} is put in the set of high transaction-weighted utilization 1- itemsets for the updated database.

STEP 8 & 9 & 10: In this example, only {C:2037} is then put in the set of high transaction-weighted utilization 1-itemsets for the updated database. After STEP 8, the high transaction-weighted utilization 1- itemsets for the updated database are {A:4399}, {B:2002}, {C:2037} and {D:3169}. The candidate 2- itemsets are then generated from the above results.

STEP 11: The STEPs 4 to 10 are then repeated until no candidate itemsets are generated. In this example, the results are {A:4399}, {B:2002}, {C:2037}, {D:3169}, {AB:2002}, {AC:1884}, and {AD:3016}.

STEP 12: In this example, two itemsets {D:2100} and {AD:2007} are considered as the high utility itemsets for the updated database.

STEP 13: In this example, no high utility itemsets are generated in this STEP.

After STEP 13, the high utility itemsets for the  updated database are {D:2100} and {AD:2007}.

5. Experimental results  A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate  the performance of the two-phase algorithm (TP-HUI) in a batch way and our proposed incremental algorithm for record insertion (FUP-HUI). The public IBM data generator was used in our experiments [8] to evaluate the performance. The first 200,000 transactions were then extracted [8] to initially mine the high transaction- weighted utilization itemsets with their actual utility values. The next 2,000 transactions were then generated sequentially used each time as new inserted transactions. Figure 2 then showed the execution time required by the two-phase algorithm (TP-HUI) and the proposed incremental algorithm (FUP-HUI) for processing each 2,000 new transactions on the T10I4N4KD200K dataset at 0.2% minimum high utility threshold.

Figure 2. The comparison of the execution time for different numbers of inserted transactions   It can be observed from Figure 2 that the proposed  FUP-HUI ran faster than the TP-HUI in a batch way.

Experiments were then also made to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed FUP-HUI in different minimum high utility threshold values and shown in Figure 3 for the execution time. The minimum high utility thresholds were then set from 1.0% to 0.2% (decrease 0.2% each time).

Figure 3. The comparison of the execution time at different minimum utility thresholds   It can easily be observed from Figure 3 that the  execution time by the proposed FUP-HUI was much less than that by the TP-HUI in a batch way for handling record insertion at different minimum high utility thresholds.

6. Conclusion   In this paper, an efficient incremental algorithm to update the discovered high utility itemsets for record insertion is proposed. When new transactions are inserted into the original database, the proposed maintenance incremental algorithm then partitions itemsets into four parts according to they are high transaction-weighted utilization itemsets in the original database or not and in the new transactions. Each part is then processed to update the discovered high utility  itemsets in its own way. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm executes faster than the two-phase algorithm in a batch way.
