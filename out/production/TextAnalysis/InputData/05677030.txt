I. INTRODUCTION  Road traffic is an indispensable important part to life, but the frequent road accidents bring serious bodily harm and loss of property[1]. Each side of road traffic accidents contains a large amount of information and data is the most common form of the most important information records. Via mining the data of road traffic accident, we can analysis accident characteristics in multi-angles, multi-level and more comprehensive, and discover potential rules[2]. Meanwhile improving road traffic safety is the main content of intelligent transportation system and it has guiding significance to the design of intelligent transportation system.



II. ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS ANALYSIS  A. Attribute analysis  The data of traffic accidents comes from the scene investigation[3]. One accident treatment including: when accident happens, according to the situation of the field survey  and analysis, mark the scene of the accident and related to the accident feature extraction of data, such as time, weather, accident incident surface morphology, and the accident casualties of data. And by asking about the scene of the accident, understand the course of the accident.

Traffic accident data is the foundation of traffic accident cause analysis. Based on the ministry of public security database of traffic accident analysis we can find that [4]: traffic accident data presented to radial and multi-dimensional three-dimensional structure, multi-level super. Each road traffic accidents records contain multiple data attributes. Each attribute value reflected an characteristic in a traffic accident.

And the more data attribute data constitute the multiple dimensions of traffic accidents. In addition, data attributes are set from the basic accident information, personnel information, vehicle information, road information and environmental information, so that the data attributes and the five perspectives( people, vehicles , road, environment and the basic information) form two levels in logical, which the five perspectives( people, vehicles , road, environment and the basic information) are the top level and the data attributes are the lower.

B. Cause analysis  Because of cooperate with disorders among people, vehicles, road and environment, road traffic accidents are the occasional unexpected event in the road traffic system. Cause analysis of traffic accidents are mainly the research on the formation of traffic accidents by people, vehicles, roads and environmental aspects [1].

Human factors. People are the moving of a traffic safety and the main body of traffic safety. In the road traffic system, the persons are not only the maker of traffic accidents, but also the victims. The persons include all those who use the roads, such as drivers, passengers, pedestrians. They are objective object in the transportation system. Without comprehensive and timely perception, correctly thinking, accurately determine and sensitive operation response, it will lead to traffic accidents. In this paper we mainly analysis the factors of driver's side, and it can be summarized in figure 1.

Figure 1.  Driver factors affecting the traffic safety  Vehicle factors. Vehicles are the main running tool of modern traffic. The quality of technical condition of vehicles is a direct factor affecting road safety. The main vehicle factors are the motor factor. Poor motor performance, mechanical failure or parts damage may be the direct factor causing traffic accidents. The main impact factors of autocar safety are steering, braking, driving and electric. The influence factors of motor vehicles on the road safety are shown in figure 2.

III. THE BASIC THEORY OF DATA MINING  Data Mining is the process that to extract information and knowledge which are potentially useful without known in advance from a large number of incomplete, noisy, fuzzy, random real data. In short it is to extract or "mining" knowledge from the large amounts of data.

Data mining technology has a powerful data analysis capability. According to road traffic accident data, it can find the potential accident information or rules through data mining method and provide data analysis support for the road safety research [5].

A. Rough Set Theory  The fuzzy and uncertainty of rough set theory is based on the concept of the border, that is, a collection has fuzzy boundaries in particular knowledge [6]. Relative to a particular case, each set can be expressed by the exact concept of the upper approximation and the lower approximation of that: according to the knowledge representation system ),( AUS = , design UXAR ?? ? , set and upper approximation )(XR? of X, the lower approximation )(XR? can be expressed as:  }:/{)( ???=? XYRUYXR ??       (1)  }:/{)( XYRUYXR ??=? ?        (2)  At the same time, defined )()( XRXposR ?= as X?s  R-positive domain; )()( XRUXnegR ??=  as X?s R-negative  domain; )()()( XRXRXbnR ? ? ?= as X?s R-boundary region.

Visually speaking: X?s R-positive domain is a set of knowledge R that can be classified to X; X?s R-boundary region is the set of the knowledge R that can not determine whether classified to X; R-upper approximation is the set of the knowledge R that my be classified into X, and it is also the merger of positive region and boundary region.

B. Theory of association rules  Association rules is an important topic in the field of data mining proposed by Rakesh Agrawal and others. Association rules reveal the relationship among the data. Association rule mining is to analysis the frequency relationship of the data sets in the transaction from a given set of data items and transactions (each transaction is a data collection of items)[7].

Association rule mining can find large amounts of data in an interesting correlation between item sets or related links.



IV. ANALYSIS OF THE CAUSES OF ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS BASED ON DATA MINING  For the road traffic accidents in specific time and space, each accident occurred is not completely independent. We should take full account of the relationship of the accident between other road traffic accidents in the specific context.

Firstly analysis the association rules of historical data on road traffic accidents appling data mining, and take it as the  standard mode, recognize the single cause pattern of the accident, and finally get their specific causes.

The forward set of road traffic accidents influence factors include road linear, traffic control method, weather conditions, etc. And the accident attributes are the latter set including the accident level and accident form. By the association mining of road traffic accident data, in a certain threshold condition, we can obtain in a series of association rules on the cause, like the form BAAA i ???? 21 , formatting the associated rule sets  of road traffic accidents causes. For the particular latter set Bq of association rules, there exists a generalized association rules matrix J, constitute the causes of the comparison matrix, as in (3).

? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  =  qnknn  qj  qi  BAAA  BAAA BAAA  J  ???  ??? ???     (3)  Define the standard model set M of the road traffic causes, in which the standard mode 1 is M1, the standard model 2 is M2,......, the standard mode n is Mn, as in (4).

? ?  ?  ? ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  =  nqnknn  qj  qi  MBAAA  MBAAA  MBAAA  M  ,  ,  ,     ???  ??? ???  (4)  Where, the support of qmjmm BAAA ???? 21  is smp ,  and the confidence level is cmp . One road traffic accident to be  identified can be expressed as ),( qBAG = , in  which ),,,( 21 lAAAA = , qB are the incident type value of the property after the accident experience. The general  membership of road traffic accident G is defined as )(' Gm?  to the standard model Mm. Establish generalized membership  function of the causes of road traffic patterns, as in (5).

? ? ==  ??= j i in  l sl  sm m  p p  j G    ' )1()( ?? ?       (5)    Where  j?the forward dimension of the standard mode Mm corresponding to the cause association rules, values of 1,2, ...;  Psm?the support (%) of the standard mode Mm corresponding to the cause association rules;  ? ?the weight of index j?  Among them, i? is the property for road accidents  discriminant function, as in (6).

? ? ?  ? ?  = AA AA  mi  mi i ,1  ,0 ?            (6)  Where  Am?the property value of item i of the standard mode  Mm corresponding to the cause association  rules? forward set, values of 1,2, ..., j;  A?the impact factor set of road traffic accidents of G.

Through standardize the generalized membership function,  we can get the standard membership function )(Gm? of the  genetic model of road traffic accidents, as in (7).

? = = n  i i  m m  G G  G  '  '  )( )(  )( ?  ??             (7)  Using the membership function above criteria to calculate road traffic accident on a standard model G the degree of membership, and choose the maximum degree of membership, as in(8).

))(,),(),(max()( 21 GGGG nr ???? ?=    (8)  Select the maximum degree of value, determine the causes model of road traffic accidents G, as in (9).

rMG ?                 (9)  By the pattern recognition model, the causes of a single road traffic accident will be added into the standardized set of the regional road traffic accidents causes, that is associated with the completion of the causes analysis of the accident.



V. CASE ANALYSIS  Extract 100 sets data from traffic accidents database of a certain city, and then analysis the road traffic accident data using the method in this paper, finally obtained each traffic accident causes mode. Via checked by manpower, the accuracy rate of the accident cause model extents to 86%, which satisfy the demand of traffic safety management.



VI. CONCLUSION  The study on road traffic accident causes can identify the key factors rapidly and efficiently and provide instructional methods to the traffic accidents? prevention and road traffic accidents? reduction, which could greatly reduce personal casualty and property loss caused by road traffic accidents.

Meanwhile, it would be helpful for improving the efficiency and security service level of the road transportation system.

The study of this paper can provide forceful data analysis support for the road traffic safety related research.
