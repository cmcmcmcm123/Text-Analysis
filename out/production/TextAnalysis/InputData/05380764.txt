Exploring the effects of text clustering on on-line military news based on  quantitative association rule

Abstract  Text clustering is an automatic technique to group texts using the approach of feature extraction and term connection to calculate the similarities among subject contents of texts. Since the properties of terms in Chinese text (e.g. segmentation and annotation) are not as clear as the other languages, extracting and distinguishing features from Chinese text is therefore much more difficult, which greatly impacts the effects of clustering. From the perspective of military news, this paper applies both quantitative association rule and hierarchical agglomerative algorithm to cluster Chinese news published in Youth Daily News, and the application results are compared with those by the traditional vector space model approach and by the general association rule approach, respectively. F-measure is used as evaluation metric in the experiments. Experimental results show that the quantitative association rule approach performs more accurately than both the vector space model and association rule in text automatic clustering.

1. Introduction  Data mining is generally used to mine information from a structured data, such as a transaction database, rather than from an unstructured data, such as a document, webpage, and so on. The emerging field of text mining uses method from data mining to extract interesting information and knowledge. In general, the process of text mining includes: domain selection, text preprocessing, mining analysis, and result visualization. Domain selection is the step to collect and arrange plenty of text data in a specific subject domain. In the step of text preprocessing, terms in a document are divided or combined based on the relevant rules, and the key-terms being able to represent the characteristic of text is selected. By the  rules of appearance frequency, co-occurrence, or cluster, mining analysis is performed to construct the relationship among word structures. In the result visualization step, the correlated results are exhibited through graphic tools.

Traditional text clustering often adopts the vector space model (VSM) approach to express text data. By this approach, Lee et al. showed that there are two drawbacks in clustering results [10]. Firstly, since the relationships between terms in text can not be identified, the clustering of text is misjudged.

Secondly, high dimension of terms will easily induce the problem of inaccurate clustering. Therefore, Lee et al. [10] proposed a two-stage document-clustering method based on association rule mining to investigate the text cluster problem for the document in English.

However, traditional association rule (AR) approach practically only considers if a term appears in the document, but the occurrence quantity of term is ignored, which can not reflect the actual connection between terms. Fabrizio et al. [6] argued if the quantity is took into account during the AR mining process, more hidden connections among rules and more multiple relationships among items may be discovered to be applied on other different practices. Since the factor of quantity is not currently considered in the application of association rules on text mining, this paper adopts the qualitative association rule (QAR) approach, which adds the occurrence frequency of term in every document into the items to mine rules, to increase the connections among words, to reduce the noises resulting from misjudgment, and to enhance the quality of clustering for documents in Chinese.

2. Literature review  2.1 On-line News With the rapid development of information  technology and the increment and generalization of network user community, the news website not only   DOI 10.1109/IALP.2009.48    DOI 10.1109/IALP.2009.48     presents news events but also provides some functions of news categorization and recommendation to satisfy the users? requirements on querying information from news. For instance, in Google News, news events can be automatically classified, and users can select their own country languages as well as recommend some specific news; in Yahoo News, except for the functions of news classification, the functions of photo news and popular recommendation are also included.

Chen et al. [3] selected Google News as sample sources to propose an automatic method for constructing news knowledge ontology, and this method then was applied on automatic query expansion of news search engine to resolve the issues of uneasily selecting a good query term for users. For the news on both CNN and Reuter?s websites, Perelomov et al. [12] proposed a self-organizing map (SOM) based approach to construct a news subject map. By selecting on-line news as sources, Ong et al.

[11] applied natural language processing (NLP) technique to automatically extract terms in the news, and constructed a hierarchical news map.

However, the literatures above investigated the on-line news in general scopes, but the news in a specific domain, particularly in military domain, had not been explored.

2.2 Quantitative Association Rules Data mining is attempted to discover the useful  hidden information from plenty of data. The main techniques in data mining involve classification, cluster, sequential patterns, AR, and decision tree, etc.

Han [8] depicted that the technique being most often used is the association rule, which uses both support and confidence parameters to find out the connections among item sets. Traditional AR is based on the Apriori algorithm to analyze the item sets in transaction database. Recently, many Apriori algorithm based association rules have been proposed [4, 7, 9].

However, traditional association rules merely consider if the item appears in transaction database, but the quantity of item bought is neglected. In practice, both the item and its quantity are recorded in transaction data [2]. In QAR mining, the different corresponding membership methods are adopted to partition the intervals for the item with different quantity in order to mine more and more potential useful association rules. The quantitative partition algorithm is shown in Fig. 1.

2.3 Cluster analysis Clustering means the automatic assignment of a  set of data into some subsets in which the data with  higher similarity in some senses are automatically grouped. The objective of cluster analysis is to discover the clustering results and infer some useful, hidden, and interested features and phenomenon through analyzing the similarity degree among data.

Hierarchical clustering utilizes the agglomerative or divisive method to merge those smaller clusters with higher degree of similarity among them into the larger clusters, or according to the requirements of users, to split the larger clusters to generate different number of clusters. The hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) algorithm is a bottom up approach to merge all the data points.

In the HAC algorithm, there are four methods to define the distance between clusters: single-linkage, complete-linkage, average-linkage (AL), and Ward?s method. Chuang and Chien [5] revealed that the clustering results of average-linkage are the best among four methods. Thus, this paper adopts the AL method to calculate the distance between documents.

Step1: Let {<i,q1>,<i,q2>,<i,q3>?<i,qn>} be the set of q_items in DB which have the same item i. And q1< q2< q3?< qn.

Step2: Assume that c1,c2,c3?,and cn are the numbers of transactions containing <i,q1>,<i,q2>,<i,q3>?,and <i,qn>, respectively.

Step3: Let T be the total number of transactions.

Step4: First, we find a minimum integer k such that is  greater than or equal to the lower support threshold, e, say S1, and generate the interval [q1?qk].

Step5: Then, find a minimum integer k2(k2>k1) such  that    1 S T  c k  km m  ? ?  += and generate the interval [q(k1+1)?qk2].

Step6: The remaining intervals are similarly computed.

Step7: If    1 S T  c k  km m  ? ?  += , the last generated interval  [q(k(j-1)+1)?qj] is combined with [q(kj+1)?qn] to form the interval [q(k(j-1)+1)?qn].

Research Design The research design of this paper is divided into  five stages: data collection, term preprocessing, term correlation, cluster analysis, and result evaluation. In data collection stage, this paper is mainly focused on military news documents. During the stage of term preprocessing, the keywords being representative of document are extracted to form a thesaurus. This stage involves the steps of Chinese term segment processing, N-Gram based term selection, meaning     consistency, and weight calculation of term. In term correlation stage, VSM, AR, and QAR approaches are applied to mine terms, and matrix of document vector, association matrix of terms, and association matrix of quantitative terms are established, respectively. For cluster analysis stage, traditional VSM approach uses the cosine theorem to calculate the similarity degree between documents, and collocates with the HAC algorithm to cluster together the documents; whereas both AR and QAR approaches use two-staged document cluster framework to execute cluster analysis. In the framework, the terms are first automatically clustered, and then the score of document in each term cluster is calculated to classify the document into the specific term cluster with higher score. In the result evaluation stage, precision, recall, and F-measure are selected as evaluation metrics to analyze the cluster results. Fig. 2 presents the research flowchart of this paper.

News published in Youth Daily News [13] , which is issued by Ministry of National Defense, Taiwan, R.O.C., from June 2008 to February 2009 are collected as sample sources. Thus, 1026 news are acquired, and they can be divided into 14 categories in Chinese as shown in Table 1.

3.2 Text Processing (1) Extraction and label of Chinese words  The Chinese automatic phrase segment system, CKIP (Chinese Knowledge and Information Processing) developed by Academia Sinica, is  adopted in the paper to segment term for documents in Chinese.

(2) Selection of word characteristics  In this paper, three categories of word characteristics, including noun (3 subcategories), verb (15 subcategories), and non-adjective (1 subcategories), are used to merge the word characteristics together for extracting the meaningful terms.

Table 1. Quantity of news collections No. Category Quantity 1 ????(Military justice and discipline) 101 2 ????(Taiwan-China relations) 223 3 ????(Reserves and Mobilization) 52 4 ????(Force training) 105 5 ????(Information security) 66 6 ????(Veterans service) 102 7 ????(All-out defense) 58 8 ????(Military disaster-relief) 52 9 ????(Military housing service) 33  10 ????(Muster-call) 37 11 ????(Counseling work) 51 12 ????(Sino-U.S. relations) 60 13 ????(Sino-Japanese relations) 34 14 ????(Energy saving & carbon reduction) 52  Total 1026  (3) N-Gram based term selection  Since the word segmented by CKIP belongs to an element with fundamental unit, this paper applies the N-Gram based term selection approach to merge the words so that the terms extracted out are more meaningful. Firstly, the contents of document are separated by 2-Gram or 3-Gram word combination. If the word frequency of co-occurrence for the segments of paired words or three sets of words is higher than a specific threshold, those segments are merged as an independent term. By the N-Gram based term selection approach, the terms with more completed meaning can be segmented, and the terms with recently fresh and popular meaning, such as those terms ???? (milk scandal)?, ????? (flexible diplomacy)?, and ?????(charter flights between Taiwan and China)?, can be discovered.

Those terms used in the documents of professional domain, for example, ?????(physical isolation)?, and ?????(postal service cooperation)?, can also     be correctly segmented. Therefore, the terms selected in this approach have higher connections.

(4) Integration and modification of terms  The guidelines of integrating and modifying terms are set as follows.

Rule 1: If the terms with same meaning are  represented in different combination of words, then the term with higher occurrence frequency is selected as the term to be analyzed. For example, although ??????, ????, ????, and ????????? are used to stand for the Mainland China, ???? is selected as term to replace the others by this rule.

Rule 2: Term both in Chinese and English is unified.

For instance, MOU, CECA, and WHO are used to represent ?????????, ??? ????????, and ??????? , respectively. By this rule, the abbreviation in English is chosen to stand for the term in Chinese.

Rule 3: If some nouns are too common and are weakly connected to news, such as ???? ? (wish)?, ? ? ? (future)?, ? ? ? (implementation)?, and ???(direct)?, they will be deleted.

3.3 Experimental Design  The experiments are designed to analyze and compare the automatic clustering results by the approaches of VSM, AR, and QAR. In experiment A, for the document vector matrix generated by VSM, the HAC algorithm is applied to conduct the text automatic clustering. Traditional AR and QAR approaches are performed in experiments B and C, respectively. In these two approaches, two-stage method is implemented to execute the automatic clustering. On the first stage, the HAC algorithm is used to carry out the automatic clustering on terms.

On the second stage, a comparative function [10] is designed to calculate what the matching score of each document is in each term cluster produced on the first stage. If a document scores the highest score in a specific term cluster, the document is classified into this cluster. The experimental design is described as follows.

(1). Experiment A (VSM method) Step 1: Assign every news event as a vector in space.

Then, transfer the documents in all the sets to  a vector space matrix.

Step 2: Use the cosine theorem to calculate the  similarity degree between two documents. Let  1D and 2D denote the vector representative forms of the document 1D and 2D , respectively. The formula of the similarity degree between documents 1D and 2D is expressed as:    ( )  21,cos  DD  DDDD ?  ?=  (1) Step 3: Establish the vector matrix of similarity  degree for the document.

Step 4: Apply the HAC algorithm on the document to  execute automatic clustering, and generate the results of text automatic clustering.

(2). Experiment B (AR method) Step 1: Apply AR approach to mine the term. Then,  assign the average confidence of term as the similarity degree, and establish the term matrix.

Step 2: Apply the HAC algorithm on the term to execute clustering, and generate the results of term automatic clustering.

Step 3: Use the comparative function to calculate what the matching score of each document is in each term cluster. If a document scores the highest score in a specific term cluster, the document is classified into this cluster.

(3). Experiment C (QAR method) All the steps are the same as those in experiment B except that the QAR approach replaces the AR approach in Step 1.

3.4 Evaluation metrics Since Precision (P), recall (R), and F-measure  are usually used to evaluate the performance of information retrieval, this paper also uses these three performance metrics to evaluate the accuracy of text clustering. Let Nt and Nc be the classification results by man-made and automatic clustering, respectively.

Then, the formulas for P, R, and F-measure are defined as follows.

c  ct tc N  NNP ?=,                         (2)  t  ct tc N  NNR ?=,                         (3)  tctc  tctc tc RP  RP F  ,,  ,, ,  +  =                          (4)     4. Result analysis The accuracy evaluation results of experiments A,  B, and C are listed in Table 2, which shows that all three performance metrics of VSM approach are the worst when compared with those of AR and QAR.

The reason is each term is considered to be an independent state in the VSM approach.

Table 2: Accuracy evaluation results VSM AR QAR  Precision 0.548 0.701 0.740 Recall 0.420 0.669 0.694 F-measure 0.453 0.681 0.714   In the AR approach, the relationship between  terms is emphasized, so that the term rules mined by data mining technique have higher connection degree, which improves the shortcoming of low connection degree by VSM approach. Compared with the VSM approach, the AR approach increases 0.228 in the F-measure metrics.

In the QAR approach, the concept of quantity is taking into account in the word, which further emphasizes the relationship between terms. Since the terms with same meaning but with different quantity may have different connection degree with the other terms, the terms with different quantity are divided into some divisions. This procedure can more accurately mine the connection between terms.

Accordingly, the QAR approach increases 0.261 in the F-measure metrics when compared with the VSM approach. Furthermore, the performance comparisons between the AR and the QAR approaches reveal that the latter approach is 0.033 better than the former approach in each of precision, recall, and F-measure metrics. Therefore, applying the QAR approach can obtain the more accurate mining results and the better automatic clustering effects.

Additionally, Table 3 exhibits the effects of automatic clustering on each category of news sample sources described in section 3.1 by applying the VSM, AR, and QAR approaches.

For the F-measure metric, the effects of automatic clustering resulting from both the AR and QAR approaches are better than those resulting from the VSM approach. Moreover, Table 3 also shows that the QAR approach performs the best on 11 categories, and the AR approach performs the best on 3 categories.

The comparisons of F-measure metric on each category among three approaches are represented in Fig. 3. In general, the QAR approach performs better than the AR and VSM approach.

Conclusion  This paper applies both AR and QAR approaches to extract the terms with high connection, and integrates with the HAC algorithm to execute the automatic clustering on on-line Chinese military news documents. The accuracies of automatic clustering among the VSM, AR and QAR approaches are compared. Experimental results show that the F-measure metric of applying traditional VSM approach on automatic clustering is 0.453, the application of AR approach can increase the F-measure metric to 0.681, and finally the application of QAR approach can further enhance the F-measure metric to 0.714. Consequently, for the issue of Chinese document automatic clustering, this paper proposes an integrated approach of combining the     QAR with the HAC algorithm to improve the quality of text automatic clustering. From the experimental results, it is concluded that the proposed integrated approach can effectively enhance the quality of text automatic clustering, and can obtain the more accurate effects of automatic clustering.

Because the news sample sources are collected from the military news published in Youth Daily News during the period between June 2008 and February 2009 and are reported from the stand point of military, the more sample sources should be expanded to the news from other newspapers and during the longer time periods and be from the other reporting perspectives in the future. Furthermore, for the future research direction, the concept of semantic analysis can be taking into account to more clearly present the connection between terms for the objective of improving the effects of automatic clustering.
