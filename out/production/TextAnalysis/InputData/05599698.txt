USING DATA MINING TO INVESTIGATE COGNITIVE PROCESSES BY A CREATIVITY TEST? A PRELIMINARY STUDY

Abstract This article presents a novel researched method for  investigating the cognitive processes of children. This study designed an activity to observe characteristics of cognitive process. In the activity, children were asked to engage in thinking and using scientific concept to draw as many as possible optical paths between the laser gun and target. There were 95 fifth graders participate in this study. Association rules mining were 1used as a research method for exploring relationships between different types of optical path in this experiment. The data mining results demonstrated that it consist with Piaget?s cognitive development theory, showing that concrete operation is the dominant thinking mode for fifth grader. It is concluded that data mining is an appropriate research method for analyzing the cognitive processes when it is cooperated with research techniques in thinking skills, such as creativity or problem-solving.

1. INTRODUCTION  Association rule mining is a popular and a well developed research method for business management. It is used to discover interesting relations between variables in large databases. Agrawal et al. [1] had introduced the basic concepts of associated rule mining.

For example, a customer buys bread; he/she is likely to also buy jam. This information can be used to predict behavior pattern and model of consumers. Though this method was first used in business, the application of this method is getting more popular in other research fields.

In the educational field, this method have been used to find conceptual map models [3] and learning portfolio analysis [4] but seldom used in cognitive process analysis. This article presents a new researched method for investigating the cognitive processes of children during creatively solving problem.

Proc. 9th  IEEE  Int. Conf. on Cognitive  Informatics  (ICCI?10) F. Sun, Y. Wang, J. Lu, B. Zhang, W. Kinsner & L.A. Zadeh (Eds.)     2. METHODOLOGY  In this section, subjects, instrument and data collection, data analyzed were introduced as followings.

2.1 Subjects  There were 95 fifth graders from four intact classes participated in this study. These students were from a school in Tuo-Yuan County, Taiwan. Students in this school were composed of diverse socio-economic statuses and could be regarded as a typical school in Taiwan.

2.2 Instrument and Data Collection  We designed an experiment to explore the characteristic of cognitive process of human, in this case, na?ve student. The theoretical background of this design was following the research founding in creativity research. Studies in this research area has been identified that the fluency and unique were important to one?s creativity [2]. This study developed a fluency test activity to induce students? cognitive thinking structure.

In the experiment, students were invited to actively engage in thinking and using basic scientific concept to draw as many paths as possible of using a laser beam to shoot the target as indicated in Figure 1. An additional requirement to the test was that student needed to use the minimum of mirrors to reach the target. This modification from traditional creativity test allowed students to show his/her fluency, in addition, some unique thinking. This also provided information for us to observe students? cognitive operation process.

Fig. 1. Many boards was provided to the  students for they to draw as many paths as possible  Notes: A: The LASER BEAM shouts downward; B, The TARGET; C, Use a minimum number of MIRRORS   Students were given enough time to make drawing in  classes. After the test, students? diagrams were collected,  translated and coded for later analyzing.

2.3 Data Analysis  Students? drawings were coded and analyzed with association rules mining method [1].

3. RESULT AND DISCUSSION  Analyses of students? draws were showed in Table 1.

The percentage of each optical path that students have drawn was showed in the last column. From this table, it was interesting to find that students? cognitive operations in this experiment were systematic. Two factors were found here: the first, ?forced adapting? vs.

?planned adapting?; the second, ?short path? vs. ?long path?.

The s6 path was a typical example of ?forced adapting.? Student added mirrors only when the beam was about to touch the wall or black brick. This revealed the student put mirror to reflect the beam when he/she was forced. Differently, the s1 showed a typical example of ?planned adapting.? Student ?planned? the position of mirrors and put mirror, but not ?forced? by the wall or brick and no choice to do so. Student who drew s1 was considered to be more ?abstract thinking.? And, student drew s6 was considered to be more ?concrete thinking.?  From Table 1, percentages of more abstract-oriented optical path s1, s3, and s5, (22, 15 and 20%, respectably) were lower than that of other more concrete-oriented optical paths (s2, s4, and s6; 87, 62, and 86% respectably). This revealed that students in the fifth grade were comparably limited in using abstract-oriented thinking then concrete-oriented thinking. Such result matches with Piaget?s cognitive development theory [5].

The seven optical paths have different length: short (s1, s2), medium (s3, s4), long (s5, s6) and shortest (s7).

As indicated previously, the optical path s1, s3, and s5 were not dominant and the optical path s6 had the effect of ?forced adapting,? thus, only s2, s4, and s7 (87, 62, and 88%) was compared. Noteworthy, the shortest path (s7) and short path (s2) were more predominant. This revealed that students preferred to develop a shorter path then long one. This paralleled with the cognitive information theory, that human tended to manipulate less information if they could.

For ex.: A->A  represents the cognitive operation is in the same category, which is from abstract to abstract. In this study, only the substantial relationships are categorized (ex.: s3->s1, but not s3->s1).

(**)The total percentages of all optical paths are over 100%, because each student may have drawn many optical paths.

From Table 1, we also found that rule set number r1,  r4, and r9, which showed s1, s3 and s5 having stronger association with each other. Since s1, s3, s5 showed the characteristic of abstract optical paths as explained before. Such relationship also indicated that abstract operations of cognitive process were bonded together. If one may demonstrate an example of abstract thinking, it is likely that he/she would be able to think abstractly in subsequent situation. On the other hand, we found that the rule set r8 was the only case showed a mild transition from concrete to concrete. This indicated that the transition of C C was not as strong and as frequently happened as A A.

In addition to in-category association as mentioned above, the result from the association rule set of seven optical paths also revealed that there was cross-category associations happened. The two cross-category associations were thinking from concrete to abstract (C  A) and thinking from abstract to concrete (A C).

When the data in rule set in A C (r3, r5, r6, r7, and  r12) were compared with data in rule set in C A (ex: r2, r11, r13, and r14), the relative high confidence value of rule set in A C implied that when one already used the abstract thinking, he/she was also able to solve other concrete problems needed to be solved. However, the C  A was not so significant. This indicated that students, who were capable of concrete-oriented thinking, might not be so able to make a cross-categories transition to abstract thinking.

4. CONCLUSIONS  The data mining results demonstrated that it corresponds with Piaget?s cognitive development theory, showing fifth grader?s concrete operation is the dominant thinking mode. It is concluded that data mining is an appropriate research method for analyzing the cognitive processes.
