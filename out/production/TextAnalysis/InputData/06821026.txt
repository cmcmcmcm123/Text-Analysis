I. INTRODUCTION Currently, different kinds of information systems have been widely deployed in logistics field. However, with fast development of technologies (e.g. computer networking, mobile internet, GPS, image processing, etc.) and continuous increasing customer demand, conventional logistics information systems indicate disadvantages due to a few realistic limitations:  1. System Elasticity.

Conventional logistics systems have to consider the  purchase of hardware and software on maximum need, and make further update according to the dynamic requirement [1]. This increases IT infrastructure expense.

2. Real-time Tracking Service.

Real-time logistics tracking service has been achieved  via implementation of RFID technology, as described in [2]. However, this could not be widely deployed due to high expense of RFID hardware.

3. Vehicle Routing Optimization.

Although researchers in academia and industry have  investigated Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and proposed corresponding approaches, they are basically not efficient in real system which consists hundreds of vehicles due to limitations of computing and storage capabilities in system server side.

4. Information Sharing and Inter-working.

High degree of corporation is a basic requirement for  logistics system in Quality of Service (QoS) enhancements well as cost reduction [3]. However, existing logistics systems are designed case by case and usually do not consider information sharing and inter-working issues.

The usage of cloud computing platform might overcome above limitations. Cloud computing is a model  for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g.

networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction [4].

Cloud computing has several advantages, such as its elasticity, widespread accessibility, shared resource pool, service on-demand and service calculable [5]. Additionally, cloud based computing model is capable to provide more secure services than traditional business models as analyzed in [6].

Mobile cloud refers to the service mode that access cloud services with mobile devices. This, on one hand, is an extension implementation of cloud computing, and on the other hand, is the capability extension to mobile devices [7]. In this paper, we investigate and propose a mobile cloud-based architecture for enrichment of existing logistics systems to achieve the target to be elastic, compatible, and intelligent. In Section 2, we describe system architecture and its corresponding technical issues.

The prototype implementation and evaluation are presented in Section 3 and finally the paper is concluded in Section 4.



II. ARCHITECTURE DESIGN In this section, we describe a mobile cloud-based system architecture for intelligent logistics system. Following the introduction, we consider issues related to customer interaction, distributed storage, logistics vehicle scheduling, MapReduce-based C-W algorithm, Restful-based mobile interaction and transmission, security and mobile payment.

A. System Overview The proposed architecture involves three main characters: User Terminal (UT), Vehicle Terminal (VT) and Logistics Cloud Gateway (LCG).

User Terminal, which can be mobile phone, laptops, PC, etc., uses a web browser or a software interface to get access to logistics cloud gateway. The connection between UT and LCG could be through either mobile or fixed network. With terminal a user could log in LCG anytime and anywhere to submit order application. After validation, a unique dimensional barcode will be generated and sent back to identify a specific order. User also could use UT to complete mobile payment via third-party payment service and track real-time state of corresponding commodities.

Vehicle Terminal, which can be a simple mobile phone or other handled devices with built-in GPS contains two   DOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.30    DOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.30     main aspects of functions. On one hand, it recognizes commodities through scanning corresponding QR code; on the other hand, it is capable to collect vehicle location information and upload it to logistics cloud. Additionally, VT could be directed to corresponding task points in optimized path.

Logistics Cloud Gateway is the key element which acts as a bridge between front-end terminal and back-end cloud computing platform. Inside LCG there are five main modules for handling different services, shown as Figure 1:  a) User Management. This part interacts with user terminal to manage customers? order and provide real-time tracking service.

b) Vehicle Management. This module mainly deals with collection of vehicle location information and direction of vehicle path according to logistics scheduling module.

c) Logistics Scheduling. This component analyzes all possible vehicle paths and decides which one could be the most suitable with consideration of distance, time, expense and other factors.

d) Security Provisioning. This module ensures connection (between UT/VT and LCG) security, data confidentiality and integrity.

e) Mobile payment. This module offers two possible mobile payment solutions based on either SMS payment or online payment. Both of them have been widely deployed in our daily life.

Figure 1. System Architecture  B. Customer Interaction We propose a novel interaction mode which customer is capable to handle most logistics related issues online, as described in the following:  a) A customer login LCG anywhere and anytime via user terminals (laptop, mobile phone, etc.).

b) An online form which contains logistics elements (original address, destination, available time, etc.) should be filled. After that, customer will receive a specific 2D QR code related with the specific order.

c) Logistics vehicle arrives at appointed time to check and receive corresponding commodity.

d) Vehicle Terminal uploads GPS information to LCG periodically.

e) Customer is capable to track state of corresponding commodity in real-time.

f) After accomplishment of distribution task, customer pays either with SMS or online payment.

C. Distributed Storage Cloud computing platform provides distributed storage services for logistics related data, including order information, vehicle location information and so on.

Specifically, logistics data is stored based on Hadoop DFS (Distributed File System), which could create multiple replicas of data blocks and distribute them on a set of cluster nodes [8].DFS has reliable, extremely rapid computations and it could reach load balance (shown in Figure 2). DFS also makes a balance in performance between input and output. The performance is to automatically distribute data blocks on the datanodes whose free-space is greater than a threshold value.

Figure 2. Structure of DFS  D. Logistics Vehicle Scheduling There might be a multitude of orders in a certain period of time. Therefore, it is necessary to define an efficient and reasonable logistics vehicle scheduling mechanism for management of existing Vehicle Route Problem (VRP), which is described in the following [9]:  Assume that a logistics distribution center serves n customers, each of which (customer i) has a commodity with weight  q  i , the number of vehicle is  v , and each  vehicle  k  has a load capacity  Q k  . VRP could be mathematically presented through a complete weighted graph V= (P, L), where P= {0, 1, ?, n} is a set of nodes representing logistics distribution center  (0)  and customers (1, 2, ?, n) . L={( i, j)| i, j?P, i? j} is a set of arcs that stands for distance between customer i and j.

Each vehicle starts from and returns logistics center.

In our approach, we consider vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). More precisely, each customer i has to be served in a time window  [ ETi, LTi ], otherwise extra penalty cost will be generated. Therefore, the question turns to how to minimize total cost during     logistics distribution process, as represented in following mathematic formulas:  (1 )  (2 )  (3 )  (4 )  (5 )  Where  c?? represents transportation cost from customer i to customer j. x??? equals to 1 if vehicle k travels from customer i to customer j, and otherwise equals to 0; p	 represents extra cost caused in case that vehicle k arrives at customer i before ET?; p represents extra cost caused in case that vehicle k arrives at customer i after LT?; T? represents the time when logistics vehicle arrives at customer i ; y?? equals to 1 if requirement of customer i is completed by vehicle k and otherwise equals to 0.

E. MapReduce-based C-W Saving Algorithm We also propose a MapReduce-based Clark-Wright (C-W) saving algorithm for handling vehicle routing problem. On one hand, MapReduce-based computing model is capable to split a big task into multiple sub-tasks and then assign them to a set of interconnected cloud nodes for distributed and parallel computing [10]; On the other hand, C-W saving algorithm considers the savings that could be acquired by linking pairs of customer nodes in a system that is composed of a central depot serving customer nodes [11]. With combination of MapReduce and C-W saving mechanism, it is possible to acquire the most suitable vehicle path with optimized cost. The handling process is described in the following (as illustrated in Figure 3): a) According to list<i, p?>. Where the key i represents  customer i and the value p?represents the position of customer i. Map calculates saving distance between any two customers using C-W saving algorithm. After that, Reduce sorts the result and outputs list < (i, j), s??> ordered by s??.

b) On the other side, Map  (with the same input as Map ) considers time windows constraint between any two customers. If connection between customer i and j violates time windows constraint, the connection is marked to be false, otherwise, it is true.

Reduce sorts the results by either 0 or 1.

According to the result of Reduce and Reduce , Map  constructs vehicle path via adding customer pairs and then checks its feasibility. After that, Reduce  is capable to sort the vehicle path and select the most suitable route.

Figure 3. MapReduce-based handling mechanism  F. Restful-based Mobile Interaction and Data Transmission  Due to realistic limitations (e.g. kernel, network, storage, etc.) of mobile devices, we suggest a lightweight restful protocol [12] for mobile cloud interaction and data transmission. Compared with traditional SOAP-based web service approach, restful-based solution is capable to provide simple, efficient, and more stable services. It offers lightweight connection and data transmission via removing most of redundant affiliated xml related element.

This greatly reduces size of transmission message and RTT time.

G. Security We suggest implementation of Trust Computing Platform (TCP) with active security defense capability in vehicle terminal. Before accessing to logistics cloud gateway (for example, every time starting on), we propose an embedded TPM (Trusted Platform Module) hardware, combined with encryption / decryption technology and trust chain transfer technology for measurement of user's identity and platform?s state. If measurement result meets the predefined security policy, then vehicle terminal is allowed to access to logistics cloud gateway. Otherwise, it is forced to connect to a specific isolated area for security improvement.

Besides, the connections among user terminal, vehicle terminal and logistics cloud gateway should be securely encrypted. We suggest the implementation of certificate based security approach. On one hand, certificate proves legitimacy of the specific node and helps establish secure session; on other hand, it provides data confidentiality, integrity and authentication among different parties.

Additionally, user should input the right user identity and password in order to get access to logistics cloud gateway.

Min?? ? ? c??x???+p	 ? Max[ET? ? T?, 0]+p ? Max[T? ? LT?, 0]??? ? ??   ??  ? ???  ? ??? ?.

With a few constraints: ? q?y?? ? Q?  ? ??? ,   i = 1,2 ? n; k = 1,2 ? v.

? y?? ? ??	 = 1, i = 1,2 ? n .

? x??? = y??,   i = 1,2 ? n ? ??	 ; k = 1,2 ? v.

? x??? = y??,   j = 1,2 ? n ? ??	 ; k = 1,2 ? v.

H. Mobile Payment Today, it is very common to use mobile devices for payment. In order to realize mobile payment, we proposed to use SMS payment and online payment. In SMS payment solution, logistics cloud sends payment information to customers via SMS and customers can pay for the cost directly with replying the message. The online payment solution relies on mature third-party payment platform, such as PayPal.



III. IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALLUATION  A. Prototype Implementation We have built a logistics cloud platform testing bed in four PCs (one for logistic cloud gateway, three for cloud computing platform nodes). Huawei U8825 mobile phone (with Android v2.2), Lenovo A2105 (with Android v4.0), Lenovo A2107 (with Android v 4.0), Iphone 4S and IPAD 4 are selected as user terminal and vehicle terminal testing tools. VMware Server 2.0.2 and Hadoop 1.0.2 are used to simulate cloud distributed environment. HBase 0.92.0 is used as a distributed data storage solution. We do test on campus network.

Before testing, we manually configure user profiles in logistics cloud gateway. We create two users (Alice and Bob) with user identity and password. This ensures that mobile agent is capable to pass security protection of logistics cloud platform. We assume that Alice wants to send a commodity to Bob and track the real-time information of order. It is possible to create more user profiles for more tests.

In some cases of experiment, two-dimensional codes can?t be recognized. One possible reason is that equipped camera in Android device is not capable to identify captured 2D QR code. In our testing, Both Alice and Bob are capable to acquire real-time tracking information.

However, it takes at most 60 seconds to show update because we set refresh time as 60s. Although this is enough for normal usage, it might reduce user experience.

We also find that in some cases our implemented platform could not obtain accurate location information of the vehicle. The distance deviation could even reaches at most 2000 meters. This problem might be in situation when GPS signals are too weak to acquire accurate location information. Overall, the prototype works well.

Figure 4. Prototype interface  A&B: User Login. User inputs username and password.

The current tab pops up a toast to inform customer the login state. After been certificated, the main menu displays on the screen of mobile phone.

C&D: Add order with user terminal. User fills in an order application form, and then price will be pre-evaluated. User can choose SMS payment or online payment.

E&F: Generation and recognition of two-dimensional code. A dimensional barcode is generated for indentifying specific order. Through scanning and recognition of two-dimensional code, customer and logistic vehicle terminal are capable to achieve corresponding order information.

G: Logistics vehicle scheduling. Cloud platform calculates and gives a suitable vehicle route.

H: Real-time tracking. When user clicks tracking request button, logistics cloud returns current location of corresponding commodity.

B. Vehicle Scheduling Mechanism Comparison We simulate a simple vehicle scheduling scenario through creating (manual configure in logistics cloud gateway component) one distribution center, four vehicles and nine customer nodes (randomly) in order to evaluate differences between two cases: without consideration of time windows and with consideration of time windows (our proposal). In both cases, four routes are generated respectively (see Figure 5). With comparison, it is capable to draw conclusions that our proposed vehicle scheduling mechanisms not superior to traditional C-W with aspect of travelling distance and cost; however, our proposal has its own advantages, especially when considering timeliness and satisfaction of users.

Figure 5.  (a) Using C-W saving algorithm without consideration of time windows; (b) Using C-W saving algorithm with consideration of  time windows  C. Resource Response Time Comparison We also evaluate our proposed restful-based approach from aspect of Resource Response Time (RRT), which is defined as total latency between request forwarding and file transfer. For comparison, we use open source testing tools soapUI [13] to execute SOAP-based web service for mobile negotiation and data transmission between user terminal and logistics cloud gateway. According to our experiment, through restful-based interaction and data transmission, it is capable to save 40%amount of transmission data and reduce 50% of Resource Response Time, shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6.  Comparison between restful-based and SOAP-based approach  D. Comparison with Conventional Solution Table 1 gives comparison among conventional logistics system and our proposed solution.  The comparison shows that due to advantages of cloud platform and proposed optimization approaches, mobile cloud-based logistics system is superior in many aspects to conventional logistics systems.

IV. CONCLUSIONS  We propose a mobile cloud-based architecture for  intelligent logistics system. Following the system  architecture is the main issues including customer  interaction, distributed storage and computing, real-time  tracking, logistics vehicle scheduling, Restful-based  transmission, security and mobile payment, etc. We use  the implementation, simulation and comparison to show  the feasibility and efficiency of this architecture.

Future work will consider security issues with special  focus on possibility of a vTPM (Virtual TPM) for security enhancement, as proposed in paper. In this solution, a virtual TPM (vTPM) framework provides a set of trustworthy services in software point of view. This framework allows multiple mutually distrustful and unaware guests to share a TPM without requiring modifications. This may be implementable in our proposed logistics system.
