Distributed Data Storage in Support for

Abstract? Context-aware computing is a new paradigm that relies on  large amounts of data collected from a variety of sources, ranging from smartphones to sensors, to automatically take smart decisions. This usually leads to large volumes of data, that need to be further processed to derive higher-level context informa- tion. Clouds have recently emerged as interesting candidates to support the storage and aggregation of such data for large- scale context-aware applications. However, specific extensions to support context-aware data need to be designed in order to be able to fully exploit the clouds? potential. In this paper we introduce such a cloud-based system, designed to support real-time processing and persistent storage of context data.

Context Aware Framework is designed as an extension of the BlobSeer storage system, building a context-aware layer on top of it to enable scalable high-throughput under high-concurrency for big context data. Our experimental evaluation validates the transparency, mobility and real-time guarantees provided by our approach to context-aware applications.

I. INTRODUCTION  Today smartphones are becoming commodity hardware.

They are seen everywhere, as more people realize that hav-  ing more sensing and computing capabilities in every-day  situations is attractive for many reasons. Smartphones are  in fact already used to optimize (e.g. by helping organizing  tasks, contacts, etc.) and assist (e.g. with navigation, find  information more quickly, access online data, etc.) users with  their everyday activities. Their success is the basis for a shift  towards developing mobile applications that are capable to  recognize and pro-actively react to user?s own environment.

Such context-aware mobile applications can help people bet-  ter interact between themselves and with their surrounding  environments. This is the basis for a paradigm where the  context is actively used by applications designed to take  smarter and automated decisions: mute the phone when the  user is in a meeting, show relevant information for the user?s  current location, assist the user find its way around a city, or  automatically recommend events based on the user?s (possibly  learned) profile and interests.

To support this, we designed Context Aware Framework ,  a middleware to automate the provisioning of context data to  mobile applications. It sits between a persistence layer, where  data is actually stored in a Cloud storage system, and the  actual context-aware application running on the user?s mobile  devices, masking the complexity of managing the data.

In our vision, a truly context-aware system is one that  actively and autonomously adapts and provides the appropriate  services or content to the users, using the advantages of  contextual information without too much user interaction.

Thus, providing efficient mechanisms for provisioning context-  sensitive data to users is an important challenge for these  systems. Context Aware Framework is designed to support the  storage of context data for such context-aware systems. It man-  ages every problem related to, for example, the unpredictable  wireless network connectivity and data privacy concerns over  the network, providing transparent access to the data to such  systems.

The contribution of this paper is twofold: we first introduce  the Context Aware Framework middleware, together with  2013 12th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing  DOI 10.1109/ISPDC.2013.21   2013 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing  DOI 10.1109/ISPDC.2013.21     the design requirements that motivated our choices; we then  present experimental results, supporting our decisions and  illustrating the performance obtained when using Context  Aware Framework .

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II  makes an analysis of the main requirements for context-  aware storage systems and presents the architecture of the  Context Aware Framework that we devised following this  analysis. Section III presents details of the implementation,  while Section IV presents evaluation scenarios and results  illustrating the overall obtained system performance. Section V  presents an overview of the main relevant work in the field.

We conclude with Section VI.



II. ARCHITECTURE  A. Analysis of requirements for context-aware applications  In a typical context-aware application users rely on their mo-  bile devices to receive information depending on their current  environment. Such applications can help users augment their  reality: they could receive information about neighbouring  places or buildings in a typical tourism application; they could  receive recommendations or navigation data that could help a  driver to more easily navigate around a city. In such scenarios  users are generally moving, and typical context data includes  elements such as locality, time, user?s status, etc. Proximity is  important for provisioning - the amount of data is potentially  too large to be served entirely on the user?s mobile device, thus  a selection of only the most relevant context data, from the  immediate surrounding environment, is preferred. Therefore,  our Context Aware Framework should be able to support user?s  mobility and provisioning of data according to his/her locality.

Except for mobility, context-aware applications should pro-  vide real-time guarantees for data provisioning. The user  should not receive events that happened too far in the past,  as such events might not even be valid for his/her current  interests. For example, if a tourist is looking for information  about objectives near him/her, he/she might not be so happy  receiving recommendations for a trip taken some while back.

The same might happen when users expect alerts about poten-  tial congestions in traffic: if he/she receives such alerts when  is already in the congested road, the information is not so  valuable anymore. To cope with such a requirement, Context  Aware Framework should support fast dissemination of data  between users.

We also acknowledge the imperfections of today?s wire-  less communication infrastructures. Context Aware Framework  will not assume user is always connected to the Internet (a  wireless connection might not be available, or in roaming  the connection might not come cheap). It will support the  use of context data even when an Internet connection is  not available, and in this case we look at alternatives such  as opportunistically using the data accessed by others from  distributed caches using only short-range communication (in  form of Bluetooth and/or WiFi).

The system should allow efficient access to the data - in  terms of speed of access, as well as support for complex  queries. Applications should be able to express their interests  using complex queries, in forms of naturally-expressed filters.

For example, the application will be able to request the data  using an expression similar to ?get prediction of my friends?  location, but only for those in town?. Or, an aggregated request  could be expressed as ?get prediction of road traffic on a  particular street?.

For context-aware applications we consider that the system  should support discovery and registration of data sources (e.g.,  sensors and external services such as a weather service), access  to data using different granularities, and the aggregation of  information.

The framework needs to support scalability. For a typical  collaborative traffic application, the number of users could  potentially be in the range of millions. The data should be  persistently stored; the history of data should be preserved for  traceability and advanced data mining processing.

Except for these theoretical requirements, we also analyzed  the functional demands coming from a context-aware applica-  tion. For this we analyzed CAPIM [6], a platform designed  to support context-aware services. Such services are designed  to help people in an university, who may be endowed with  a portable device, on top of which they run an application  which facilitates the access to information by automatically  reacting to changes of context. CAPIM brings support by (a)  providing different information contents based on the different  interests/profiles of the visitor (student or professor, having  scientific interests in automatic systems or computer science,  etc), and on the room he/she is currently in; (b) learning, from  the previous choices formed by the visitor, what information     s/he is going to be interested in next; (c) providing the  visitor with appropriate services - to see the user?s university  records only if appropriate credentials are provided, to use  the university?s intranet if the user is enrolled as staff; (d)  deriving location information from sensors which monitor the  user environment; (e) provide active features within the various  areas of the university, which alert people with hints and  stimuli on what is going on in each particular ambient. In  addition to the previously identified requirements, this scenario  validated several new ones in terms of data accesses: users  write frequently, while they read the data in a sparse way.

They have also an interest in storage of large data volumes, for  mining and processing relevant high-level context information.

To cope with these requirements, Context Aware Framework  should include several layers. First of all, for persistance,  collaborative and mobility support, the data should be stored  remotely to any mobile device. A typical relational database  has the disadvantage that accesses to the same data units  should be synchronized for strong consistency guarantees. This  cannot support well a typical scenario envisioning millions of  concurrent users writing their context data.

BlobSeer [10] is a large-scale, distributed, binary storage  service. It keeps versions for all records, so that concurrent  read/write accesses are facilitated without affecting the high  throughput of the system. BlobSeer allows concurrent accesses  to the data, and for that it uses a versioning mechanism.

Another benefit is that BlobSeer allows fine grain access to  the data: it is possible to access small chunks, without having  to read the entire Blob for example. BlobSeer also offers high  throughput for read and write operations: clients can write  new information in a chunk while others can read the old  information, without needing to synchronize.

Thus, BlobSeer [10] offers an appropriate alternative, as it  provides real-time guarantees, large concurrent access guaran-  tees, and support for eventual consistency through an advanced  versioning mechanism.

B. Architecture  Based on the identified requirements, we propose the archi-  tecture presented in Figure 1.

The architecture includes several components (see Figure 2):  Data and Metadata Clients, Brokers, the Metadata Manager,  and a Cloud-based storage layer. We next detail each compo-  Figure 1. The proposed architecture.

nent.

The Metadata Client and Data Client connect the Context  Aware Framework with the third-party context-aware appli-  cations. In the practical implementation (detailed in the next  Section) both these software components are integrated into  the context-aware application in need of their support (they  offer an API for such applications).

The Metadata Client is responsible for creating and access-  ing the metadata information that describes the context data  schema used by a particular application. In fact, we acknowl-  edge that various context-aware applications have different  requirements in terms of the data scheme used internally.

Consequently, each application can use a different data schema  to model the context.

A Data Client can write, retrieve, and store context data  necessary to a particular context-aware application. Here we  assume a one-to-one relation, each application being served  by a dedicated Data Client. Each Data Client is responsible  for supporting the mobility of the user, supporting seamless  access to the nearest Broker. The Data Client works with its  own local cache, used for offline situations, when the user  cannot access anymore the data from its Broker.

A dedicated Discovery Service is also used for the reg-  istration and discovery of the existing Metadata Manager  and Brokers. In the architecture we assume the existence of  one Metadata Manager, but several Brokers. The Discovery  Service is, therefore, also responsable for finding the Broker  most convenient for a particular Client.

The Metadata Manager manages the connections between  the meta-information describing the data, and the informa-  tion regarding the actual physical data storage. When a new  context-aware application is registered for the first time, the  Metadata Client connects to the Metadata Manager and writes  meta-information describing that particular application. The  information contains, among others, the datatype formats to  describe the context data collected/stored by the application.

Next, when the Data Client writes context data, it connects  to the nearest Broker. The context data is sent to the Bro-  ker, which in turn writes it to the Persistance layer. The  process involves two steps: first the Client writes the data,  and next asynchronously the Broker handles transparently (in  background) the actual writing into the Persistance layer.

The Broker also writes information describing the physical  storage parameters to the Metadata Manager. For persistent  storage we decided to adopt the use of Blobs. A Blob stores  the context data needed by one context-aware application. The  Metadata Manager actually links the meta-information all the  way to a particular Blob and to an offset inside it where the  particular data resides. The Metadata Manager also manages  the relation between the persistent Blobs (the ones used for  history preservation of context data) and the Brokers, where  the real-time information is preserved.

The Context Aware Framework comprises several dis-  tributed Brokers. The Broker is responsible for handling real-  time guarantees specified when an application wants to access  context data. The Broker handles requests coming from a  limited number of users, grouped based on their locality. It  supports distributed writing of data, and processing of requests  coming from clients.

For accessing the context data, a Client application gener-  ates a filter (expressing the parameters of interest) for finding  it. This filter is further received and processed by the Broker.

The resulting data is sent back to the Client, and is also  temporarily stored in a cache, local to the Broker. This cache  is used to speed up the response time for subsequent requests  for similar data. If another client sends a similar request, the  Broker is capable to reply directly with the data from its own  cache (unless the data was invalidated by a subsequent write).

For the Persistence layer we use the BlobSeer [10] storage  distributed system. BlobSeer consists of a set of distributed  entities that cooperate to enable a high throughput storage.

Data providers physically store the blocks corresponding to  the data updates; new providers may dynamically join and  leave the system. The provider manager keeps information  about the available storage space and schedules the placement  of newly generated blocks, according to a load balancing  strategy. Metadata providers store the information that allows  identifying the blocks that make up a version of the data. The  version manager is in charge of assigning version numbers in  such a way that serialization and atomicity are guaranteed.

For our Context Aware Framework Clients can sometimes  access the second to the last version of the context-aware  data until one write-in-progress operation is finished. Context  Aware Framework uses this to provide to the higher-lever  applications eventual consistency support for read/write op-  erations.

Typical context-aware applications [6] usually generate big  amounts of unstructured or semistructured data. Applications  can interpret this data in particular ways, by defining appro-  priate meta-information associated with it. The applications  can decide on their own different granularities - for example,  an application can write several chunks of data at once,  for the data corresponding to several events, and define one  single meta-entry to describe this. It is entirely left in the  responsibility of the application to define its use and schema  corresponding to the context data and associated model.



III. IMPLEMENTATION  We next developed a pilot implementation of the Context  Aware Framework architecture previously described.

As explained, the Metadata Manager is responsible for  handling the logical relation between the description of the  context data and its actual physical storage. To illustrate this,  we assume the following example: in a large city many users  might send GPS data to collaboratively support an application  capable to aggregate this information and offer a traffic model.

Some users are capable to also send data about pollution (they  have sensors for monitoring the air quality). We assume this  information is sent and stored using the previously described  Context Aware Framework .

First, the Client will write in the Metadata Manager the  datatypes used by the application:  ob jec t Locat ion { f l o a t l a t , long ; s t r i n g hw descr ip t ion ;  }  ob jec t COLevel { f l o a t l e v e l ; s t r i n g hw descr ip t ion ;  }  Next, different Clients will write the actual context data,  which is similar to:  ar ray {Timestamp , Locat ion } ==> { {243452343L , {14.5 , 34.45 , ? Nexus Galaxy ?}} , {243452354L , {14.51 , 34.467 , ? Nexus Galaxy ?}} , {243452368L , {14.53 , 34.473 , ? Nexus Galaxy ?}}  }  ar ray {Timestamp , COLevel} ==> { {243452344L , {45.3 , ? A i r Qua l i t y Sensor ?}} , {243452360L , {45.4 , ? A i r Qua l i t y Sensor ?}} , {243452412L , {45.37 , ? A i r Qua l i t y Sensor ?}}  }  The data is written in a Blob, inside the Persistence layer  - the actual data is stored in BlobSeer. In this example, the  data is written in bursts. We support this feature in cases, for  example, when a car can collect data and sent it only when  a WiFi connection becomes available. The actual information  used to describe the physical storage looks similar to:  {UUID , BlobID , BlobVers , BlobOffs , Size}  , where UUID refers to the application id that generated the  data, BlobID, BlobVers, BlobOffs and Size identify the blob,  its version, the data offset and size in the Blob where the  information was written. Next, the Metadata Manager adds  an entry linking the UUID to the  {TimestampStart , TimestampEnd , DataType , UUID , BlobID , BlobVers , BlobOffs , Size , NoRecords } :  (e.g.,  {243452343L , 243452368L , ? Locat ion ? , 0x242 , 213412L , 34 , 0 , 1234402L , 3} ) .

The actual implementation of the Metadata Manager uses  Mongodb [8], a flexible open source document-oriented  NoSQL database system. Mongodb includes support for  master-slave replication and load balancing. For searching, it  also supports regex queries. For Context Aware Framework  , the database system was preferred for several reasons: The  number of entries kept by the Metatada Manager - entries  previously described - is small. Each entry follows a structured  object-oriented data schema. Consequently, an object-oriented  database model is preferred.

Also, when the number of metadata access requests becomes  high enough, the system should be able to scale. MongoDB,  the distributed object relational database, is the natural choice,  because it support distributed deployment and high scalabil-  ity [11].

The Metadata Manager is also collaboratively used by  different applications. For security and management reasons,  in the actual implementation each application stores its related  data in separate sandboxes.

A. Filtering  As previously described, for accessing the data the Client  builds a search filter. This can include different custom data  types defined by an application. The filter specifies the re-  strictions for searching particular datatypes. For instance, a  filter can include restrictions for retrieving specific location  and pollution levels. In this example, the filter looks similar  to:  c lass F i l t e r { Locat ion l ; COLevel c ; . . .

bool f i l t e r ( ) {  r e t u r n l . l a t > 10.53 and l . long < 20.45 and c . l e v e l < 15;  }     }  The filter result is in format (timestamp, location, level).

The Client sends the serialized version of this filter class,  and the Broker loads it and instantiate it with values that match  the implementation of the filter instance.



IV. EXPERIMENTS, EVALUATION AND RESULTS  A. Experimental setup  For evaluating Context Aware Framework , we used the  following scenario: many taxis from a city are equipped  with mobile devices that run a context-aware application.

This application collects GPS data, and sends it to a server.

Clients are presented with context-aware capabilities, such  as searching for nearby free taxis or inspecting routes (for  example, the municipality can learn the popularity of routes).

As input data, we used a real-world dataset publically  available on CRAWDAD [4]. The dataset contains mobility  traces of taxi cabs in San Francisco, USA, in the form of GPS  coordinates for approximately 500 taxis collected over 30 days  in the San Francisco Bay Area (it includes approximately 11  millions unique entries).

These taxis were considered as clients for our context-  aware middleware. They were able to write data, and use  different access patterns to obtain context-based information.

Each client runs on a different node inside a distributed  system. For these experiments we used Grid?5000 [2], a large-  scale distributed testbed specifically designed for research  experiments in parallel, of large-scale distributed computing  and networking applications.

To evaluate the performance of Context Aware Framework  we had to first filter the data for each unique taxi in the  experiment. Therefore, we used 500 different input files, with  an average of approximately 20.000 records per file. Each  record is specified as [latitude, longitude, occupancy, time].

For example, a record is expressed as [37.75134 -122.39488  0 1213084687], where latitude and longitude are in decimal  degrees, occupancy shows if a cab has a fare (1 = occupied,  0 = free) and time is in UNIX epoch format.

For the storage layer, we used BlobSeer. The total data  written by each taxi is approximately 5MB.

In Grid?5000 we used 112 dedicated parallel nodes for the  clients, and 4 other dedicated parallel nodes for 4 Brokers.

One other dedicated node was used for the Metadata Manager,  and another one for BlobSeer. In these experiments we used  an increasing number of Brokers - ending with the 4-based  Broker experiment. We assume the city is equally split between  these Brokers - if a taxi always connects to the nearest Broker,  the mobility data is equilibrated such that we obtained an  approximately even number of data sent to each Broker. Thus,  the number of clients distributed per broker is uniform.

During the experiment we varied configuration parame-  ters such as: the parameters used for BlobSeer configuration  (number of data providers, and page size was progressively  increased up to 12 MB), the number of clients and brokers,  the maximum records written per chunk. We were particularly  interested in time taken to perform different operations (to  illustrate the capability to support real-time traffic), as well  as in the consumed data traffic (to evaluate the optimization  obtained when adding the caches).

First, we evaluated the writing performance. For this we  conducted several experiments where we increased the number  of clients that write data (entire input files) to Context Aware  Framework . Since we used 112 dedicated nodes, the evalua-  tion is relevant up to this limit - the results are presented in  Figure 3. Figures 4 and 5 show the result obtained for different  read access patterns. Compared to these figures, the write  operation is more time consuming. Still, the time increases by  small amounts, thus the system shows good scalability results.

Figure 3. Write Test  For evaluating the read operations, we considered two  different scenarios. First, a simple search consists in a query  where a driver wants to obtain all data relevant for a particular  location (given as latitude and longitude limits) and time  period. A more complex search operation is one where a  client queries the system for the nearest free taxi considering  a particular time moment and location. For such a query the     system has to aggregate data from two different data types.

Again, we varied the number of clients assumed in the  experiment, up to 112. The experiment ran until Context Aware  Framework has all the context data persistently written. When  all data is written, next all clients issue a filter such that all  queries will always return results. In a first experiment, we  used the same filter, but the caches will return always the  value and the time penalty is minimal. We next assumed that  each client issues a unique filter, thus each query is served  by questioning the last layer: BlobSeer. We were interested to  see the Broker?s capability to support parallel client requests.

Figures 4 and 5 show the results obtained in this case.

Figure 4. Simple Search  Figure 5. Complex Search  Again, in this case Context Aware Framework is able to  successfully handle the queries coming from distinct clients.

The results show that time increases by small amounts, thus  the system shows again good scalability results.



V. RELATED WORK  The ubiquity of mobile devices and sensor pervasiveness,  e.g., as in smart city initiatives, call for scalable computing  platforms to store and process the vast amounts of the gen-  erated streamed data. Cloud computing provides some of the  features needed for these massive data streaming applications.

However, todays cloud computing platforms lack very impor-  tant features that are necessary in order to support the massive  amounts of data streams envisioned by the massive and  ubiquitous dissemination of sensors and mobile devices of all  sorts in smart-city-scale applications. For massive context data  streaming applications, M3 [5] is a prototype data streaming  system that is being realized at Purdue using Hadoop. M3  eliminates all of Hadoop?s disk layers, including the distributed  file system (HDFS), and the disk-based communication layer  between the mappers and the reducers. It proposes a hybrid  memory-based and disk-based processing layer, includes dy-  namic rate-based load-balancing and multi-stream partitioning  algorithms, and fault-tolerance techniques. However, M3 can  handle only streaming data and does not handle queries that  mix streaming with disk-based data. A context awareness  extensible layer for M3 has been demonstrated separately in  Chameleon [7]. However, Chameleon lacks general context-  based indexing techniques for realizing context awareness,  thus when the context changes the system cannot easily  augment the query being executed by additional predicates  to reflect that change.

Similar to Context Aware Framework , the author of [9]  present a large scale system, called Federated Brokers, for  context-aware applications. In order to avoid the centralized  design(single point of failure) found in previous papers, the au-  thors propose a context-aware platform that includes multiple  brokers. The main difference compared to our system is that  our architecture implies the existence of a metadata manager  for all stored information (which relieves much of the burden  impose for managing data on the mobile application), and  that we offer prediction capabilities based on the provisioned  data. Also notable is that the evaluation of Federated Brokers  was conducted over a small-size homogeneous environment.

We actually tested Context Aware Framework over a large  grid environment, with more brokers and clients, considering  a large distributed storage configuration.

From an utility point of view, our platform can also be  compared with Google Now [1] and Microsoft On{X} [3].

Google Now [1] is able to predict what information an user  need, based on his previous searches and on his context data.

Microsoft On{X} lets the user set actions for states defined by his context data. When a certain state (previous defined by the     user) is reached, a trigger is fired. Our platform supports this  kind of approaches, being build as a framework for developers,  not as a stand alone application, like Google Now or Microsoft  On{X}.



VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK  With the advent of mobile devices (such as smartphones  and tablets) that contain various types of sensors (like GPS,  compass, microphone, camera, proximity sensors, etc.), the  shape of context-aware (or pervasive) systems changed. Previ-  ously, context was only collected from static sensor networks,  where each sensor had a well-defined purpose and the format  of the data returned was well-known in advance and could not  change, regardless of any factors. Nowadays, mobile devices  are equipped with multimodal sensing capabilities, and the  sensor networks have a much more dynamic behavior due to  the high levels of mobility and heterogeneity.

Context Aware Framework is designed to support such  requirements. In a pervasive world, where the environment is  saturated with all kinds of sensors and networking capabilities,  support is needed for dynamic discovery of and efficient access  to context sources of information. Such requirements are  mediated in our case through a dedicated context management  layer, which is responsible for discovering and exchanging  context information. We presented the context storage system  architecture for data management that includes an additional  set of components. This supports the mapping between meta-  information (describing the context) and the actual context data  stored in BlobSeer, data caching and handling requests coming  from a distinct set of users or city area, and connecting the  metadata management layer to context-aware applications. In  addition, we presented a layer that is responsible for creating  and accessing the metadata information that describes the con-  text data schema used by a particular application and allows  the mobile application to write, retrieve, and store context  data. It is also responsible for supporting user?s mobility. The  components support several requirements: user?s mobility and  provisioning of data according to his/her locality; real-time  guarantees for data provisioning; allow efficient access to the  data in terms of speed of access, as well as support for complex  queries; discovery and registration of data sources and access  to data using different granularities; and scalability.
