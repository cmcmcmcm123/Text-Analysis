I. Introduction  With the rise of relational data mining, kinds of multi-relational classifier are proposed. The existing classifiers can be divided into two kinds: the first one is based on inductive logic programming (ILP), for example, FOIL[2],TILDE[3],IBC[4]. Such approach has achieved good classification accuracy, but efficiency is lower; the second is based on relational database technology, these methods have a high efficiency, but relatively low accuracy. In recent years, the representative of Multi-relational Classification Algorithm are CrossMine[5] algorithm and the Graph-NB[6] algorithm. CrossMine algorithm is mixed ILP and relational database, improved the accuracy of traditional ILP and FOIL. But it is still based on logical reasoning, the process of Predicate Evaluation is still complex. Graph-NB algorithm is based on Semantic Relational Graph(SRG) that builds a semantic graph before classification, uses Pruning  strategy of ?cutting off? to prun the table in order to improve the Classification accuracy rate. This algorithm can directly support the relational database, but the time complexity is larger and efficiency is lower.

Chinese scholar Yang Guangmei, Yang Bingru proposed Multi-relational Naive Bayesian Classifier based on mutu- al information. It is on the basis of the tuple ID propagation method and counting methods towards tuple, can find the most relevant attributes for classification without increasing the time complexity. However, when determine the related degree between target table and other tables , the weights determined by experts in the field, it has a certain subjective. Guo Jingfeng proposed An New Multi-Relational Association Rule Mining Algorithm with User?s Guidance. The concept of user?s guidance is introduced. The usage of this approach improves user?s satisfaction of the mining result.

However, due to its highly subjective, it is easy to make semantic bias that affect classification results.

Using Rough Set, This paper propose a Multi-Relational Bayesian Classification Algorithm with Rough Set (RS-RBC). The concept of relational graph used to dynamic choice associative table associated with the target table, and a tuple ID propagation approach is used to solve directly the association rule mining problem with multiple database relations, and the concept of Core in Rough Set is introduced, simplify the associative table.

Compared with the traditional algorithm,it improves the accuracy rate. This algorithm can directly support the relational database, its running rate is much higher than that of  Multi-Relational Classification Algorithm based on ILP.



II.  Basic concepts  A.Concepts of Rough set  Knowledge reduction, that is, maintain the classification ability and delete irrelevant or unimportant knowledge.

? is equivalence relation? ,??P if ( ) { }( )Pindind ??=? ? then P  is unnecessary in ? ; Otherwise, P  is necessary in ?  .

If ,??P is necessary in ? ?zhen ? is independent?if not, then ? is dependent.

Definition 1: Core: the set of all necessary relationships is called Core in ? , denoted as ( )?Core .

B. concepts of Relational Data Mining  Relational database is composed by many relationship tables and association relationship of each table.

Definition 2: Relational graph: In a given database D, creat Relational graph through link between the table's primary and foreign key. It is a directed acyclic graph.

Each table is as a node, each side is the connection between the relationship table. Arrow points to the table where has the primary key.

Definition 3: Associative table: In database D, for a classification task T, it is called association table that related by classification task and associated with the target table.

Definition 4: Isolation table: In database D, for a classification task T, It is called isolation table that has nothing with target table.

As we can be seen, isolation table and target table are just in the same database. Moreover, isolation tables and relationships table, target table is relative. A table will become an isolated form, depending on the classification task. Figure 1 is a Relational graph of seven tables.

Figure 1 A Relational graph  333231222111 ,,,,, RRRRRR  compose a Relational graph.

11R  is targer table, 3332312221 ,,,, RRRRR  is Associative table,  56R  is Isolation table.

To show the role of associative table, using class label propagation method, a given tuple in the target table contains class label, while the tuples in other tables are no class label.

Definition 5: Class label propagation: it is supposed that there are two relations 1R  and 2R  where 1R  is the  target relation, and they can be connected by the attributes AR .1  and AR .2  where A  is the primary key or foreign key. Then the class labels of the tuple in 1R can be transmitted to the tuples in 2R  by attribute A .

In fact, the method of the class label propagation is a virtual connection in contingency table. The result from the physical connection to the table is a table that contains large amounts of data, and contains a large number of redundant data that the operation is extremely troublesome. While if it is used the method of the class label propagation , there is no such problems. And as so, we can also get the class labels of the tuples in cintingency table, and can easily calculate the nuclear properties in the table.

Definition 6 Classification Attribute Set: From multi-relational table, we can select all or part of properties to determine which class attribute set the given data belongs to, known as class attributes set.

The size and the properties of classification attribute set has a direct impact on the efficiency and accuracy of classification, so it is eaaential about how to determine the classification attribute set.



III. RS-RBC Algorithm Design and Its Implementation  A Calculation of the classification attribute set  In accordance with the classification of multi-relations, we need to calculate attributes set and their probabilities in many contingency tables. It is critical to choose what kind of property as a classification attribute, which can directly impact the classification accuracy. The multi-relational Bayesian classification algorithm based on the relationship semantic diagram is to select all the attributes as a classification attribute set, which has a large calculation. While the multi-relational Bayesian classification algorithm based on user-guided is to select all the attributes in the target table and some attributes specified by the user. Although it has a reduction of the  11R 21R  22R  31R  32R  33R  56R     computation, the users is too subjective to response the true result of the data classification.

Here we propose a method to calculate the nuclear attributes set of each contingency table using the rough set,and then find out their union as a classification attribute set. Concrete steps are as follows: (1) Calculate the nuclear properties of the target table M , recorded as ( )MCore ; (2) Do the attribute reduction to the contingency table after the tuple class label transmited, then find its nuclear property ( )iRCore ; (3) Synthesize classification attribute Set ( )sppf aaaaA ,,, 11 += , where, paa ,1 are the nuclear properties of the target table, sp aa ,1+ are the nuclear  properties of the contingency table.

B. RS-RBC Algorithm  Step 1: Analyze the primary keys and foreign keys of the contingency tables in database, resulting diagram.

Step 2: Scan diagram, in accordance with ARAR ji .. = ,  trasmit the class label of the tuple in the target table M  to the contingency tables.

Step 3: Generate classification attribute set fA ; Step 4: For m  classes mCCC ,, 21 , we need calculate the  posterior probabilities under the condition x of classification attribute set, if and only if the type  ( ) ( )xCPxCP ji = , mji ?? and ji ?  is true, the  algorithm will distribute the instance x  to class  iC  .

C Algorithm  The symbols and functions referred to the algorithm is as follows: (1) M  is the target table, iR ),2,1( ni = are the  association tables, f is the classification attribute set system-generated, x  is the tuple to be classify;  (2) Function ClassificationProb ( x ) is calculating of the posterior probability of each class;  (3) Function Propagate ( )MRi ,  means to transmit the class label to the table iR  from the target table M ;  (4) Function CreateRelationGraph (G) is generating a relation diagram.

The algorithm is as follows: Input: target table M , contingency tables iR ),2,1( ni = ,  tuple x  to be classified; Output: the class label of the tuple to be classified.

Algorithm: CreateRelationGraph (G); Propagate ( )MRi , ; For each table iR  do  iRA =Core ( iR );  ? n  i Ri Af  1=  ?   ClassificationProb ( x );  xC =maximum probability;  Output class label of x ;  D Experiment  Comparison experiment is carried out under IBM. We can do the experiments separate 10 times by three algorithm, the Naive Bayes (NB), Graph_NB and RS-RBC in the database R *. T500.F2, then calculate the average values of the 10 running times to get the result shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 the comparison figure of the running time in R*.T500.F2  Figure 2 shows that the running time by the NB classification algorithm is far longer than by the RC-RBC algorithm. When the number of the tables increases, the running time by NB algorithm increases rapidly, while that by Graph_NB algorithm or the RS-RBC algorithm is on a relatively stable, however, the performance of the RS-RBC algorithm is better than that of the algorithm Graph_NB.



V. Conclusion and Outlook  In this paper, it is given an effective multi-relationship Bayesian classification algorithm based on rough set.

Through the concept of the relation diagram, we can            10 15 20 25 30 Table numble  Time/s  NB Graph_NB     dynamically select the contingency table associated with the target table. We can improve efficiency and the accuracy in mining the massive data by a virtual connection to the contingency tables using the method of tuple class lable transmitting and by an introduction to the concept of the nuclear in the rough set. Experimental result shows that the algorithm has a significant improvement on the running time which is an extension of the traditional classification algorithm in dealing with the massive data.

The further research is including how to use the rough set method to determine the weight of the contingency tables and the selected class attribute weights, and thus to build up multi-relationship weighted Bayesian classification algorithm based on rough set.
