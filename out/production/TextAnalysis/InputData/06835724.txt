I.  INTRODUCTION The data-centric "Big Data" era has arrived and the study  on Big Data will become an important research direction of computer science for next period of time. United States Government vividly refers to Big Data as "the future of the new oil". Big Data will have a profound impact for the future of science and technology and economic development. The scale of having the data will become an important part of overall national strength as well as the ability to use the data in a country, and the possession of the data and control capabilities will also be a new standard for the measure of inter-state and inter-enterprise competitiveness [1].

Internet of things, cloud computing, mobile internet, car networking, mobile phone, tablet PC, PC and a wide variety of sensors throughout all corners of the earth are data source or carrying the way. The direct purpose of doing scientific research on Big Data is rapidly obtaining valuable information from a variety of types of data. Big Data can be divided into big data technology, big data projects, big data science and big data applications. The features of Big Data can be summarized as four "V", namely Volume, Variety, Value, Velocity. These four characteristics can be understood as: first, the data volume is huge, jumping from TB to PB; second, the data type is various, including blogs, videos, pictures, location information etc; third, the value density is low but the commercial value is high, such as surveillance video, potentially the useful data is only one or two seconds; fourth, the processing speed is quick, following Second Law of Big Data.

In a variety of technical challenges in dealing with Big Data, a new data representation method that how to model Big  Data is worthy of paying high attention, as it is the base understanding the meaning of the data and processing data. At present the method of representing data can not directly express the data itself significance. To effectively use the data and mining the knowledge, the most appropriate data representation should be found. If you want to find big data fixed pattern, causality and correlation in one kind of inappropriate data representation, you may fall into inherent prejudices [2]. Data representation method has a close relationship with initial data filler. If the original data is necessary for identification, it will greatly reduce the difficulty of the data identification and classification. However, causing the user so much trouble because of identifying the data is often not recognized by the users. Study on effective and simple data representation method is one of the technical problems which must be solved in the network big data processing.

In view of the above problems, this paper proposes a big data modeling method of oriented electronic document. The core of this method is representing knowledge of electronic document and building Big Data model of electronic document using of ontology meta-model architecture. Thus it can form a Big Data reduction of knowledge base of electronic document and lays a solid foundation to meet the high quality of personalized and diversified needs. And this paper achieves modeling process based on ontology meta-model architecture through the case.



II. ONTOLOGY AND METAMODEL FRAMEWORK Ontology is formal and explicit specification of a shared  conceptualization. The ontology we can define concepts and relationships among concepts. We can define the concept and represent the relationship among the various concepts taking advantage of ontology [3]. Ontology is the study of the nature of existence and its intrinsic relationship. The research object of ontology is the nature of existence and its internal relationship. In cognition, ontology is a set of concepts talking about within a certain range of knowledge with a granularity and a kind of semantic agreement they give.

A. Ontology   Ontology element modeling is a meta-theory, and it can unify understanding for a problem in the field of research, also   DOI 10.1109/CSA.2013.198     eliminate conflict and confusion of understanding because of different application backgrounds. Therefore, in the semantic services environment, ontology-based information model is suitable to solve problems of heterogeneous information and so on. The model can achieve communication and exchange between human and computer systems and among systems.

Semantic sharing and collaborative work can be well reflected in the model.

The ultimate goal of ontology element modeling is to achieve the semantic interoperability between various objects.

The standard measure of semantic interoperability is the semantic interoperability capabilities. Semantic interoperability capability refers to the ability exchanging the data of precise meaning between two objects, and the receiving side can accurately translate or convert the information carried by the data and the knowledge carried by the information. Namely information and knowledge can be understood, it brings about the result of an effective cooperative behavior finally, and the effectiveness confirmation of results is agreed by the two interoperable sides [4]. Semantic interoperability capability is divided into the following three levels:  1) Complete semantic interoperability: It is also known as deep semantic interoperability. In other  words both parties fully understand the semantics of the agreement.

2) Partial semantic interoperability: Both parties only can understand the part semantic of the  agreement.

3) No semantic interoperability: It appears no semantic interoperability including syntax (or  structure) interoperability, when semantic interoperability capabilities below a certain threshold.

B. Meta-Model Framework RGPS meta model framework is composed by the meta  model of four levels including Role-Goal-Process-Service, namely, Role layer, Goal layer, Process layer, Service layer.

RGPS meta-model framework is able to provide strong support for interoperability through the association between the four- level meta-model [5].

The hierarchical relationship between RGPS meta-model is shown in Figure 1. The modeling process based on RGPS starts on the analysis of the organizational structure of the demand problem space and ends on generating the solutions based on service by mapping and transformation between levels. Role layer meta-model describes organizations, roles, participants and their interaction in the space. Goal layer meta-model depicts a process refining the user's goal layer by layer, and determines the relationship of mutual restraint between the objectives [6]. Process layer meta-model describes the process used to achieve their goals, and defines the control structures of the process, input or output as well as pre or post conditions.

Service layer meta-model pictures the service chain structure used to implement the process and polymerization of the resources needed, and provides service-based implementations for the user?s needs.

Figure 1.  Role-Goal-Process-Service meta-model of the relationship  A domain modeling method O-RGPS for specific areas on the basis of RGPS meta-model framework was proposed under the guidance of ontology element modeling method. In O- RGPS domain modeling method the basic output result of domain modeling is domain knowledge base, including domain ontology (O) and the domain model (RGPS). They are core assets in two areas. O represents domain ontology, including the domain entity ontology, domain operation ontology and domain situation ontology. The three categories ontology and their mutual semantic association ensure semantic collaboration between the domain models.



III. ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT MODELING METHOD Role assumes appropriate role goal. Actor prefers his own  personal goal. Process of goal decomposition ends until acquiring operability goals. Process can achieve those operability goals, and also be completed through cooperation between processes. Service can perform the corresponding process, and achieve those objectives.

A. RGPS Association Meta Model In order to facilitate service selection, the association rules  between RGPS should be registered in each registered base.

Role, goal, process and the correspondingly multiple constraints between services should also be maintained. These constraints can be used to check whether or not the registration information is in the approved status. When the corresponding constraint relationship (relationship between models) is satisfied, the corresponding registration information is in the approved status. A service can only achieve a goal. When we register the service in the registration database, the service can still be registered in an unauthorized state, although the corresponding goal instance does not exist. Only when the corresponding goal instance exists and the relationships between them have been established, the corresponding registration information is only in an approved status. The registration information satisfying the constraint relationships benefit searching candidate services to meet user?s needs according to the association rules between RGPS.

B. Electronic Document Modeling Process Under the guidance of RGPS requirements meta-modeling  framework, the electronic document modeling process can be regarded as a demand-driven modeling process. This process includes the following stages: first, role and goal extraction of domain specific; second, process analysis of application specific; third, extracting ontology of electronic document in     specific areas. This process is not a one-way process, but is a process which needs to interactive feedback and iteration with the users.

1) Role and Goal Extraction of Domain Specific The guidance of role layer meta-model is reflected in:  describing organization, role and their interaction and collaboration in the demand problem; guiding to extract business rules in the demand problem; portraying the personal goal of actor-participants of role; describing the organizational responsibility which the role should bear. The analysis of role layer occupies an important basic position in RGPS element modeling framework [7]. Because role reflects the information which interrelates with the user?s organization, this information plays a crucial role for ensuring the completeness and consistency of requirements. When the user proposes requirements, the user?s role should be first cleared. Then according to his role we infer role objectives to improve the user's needs, which some users have not yet made, but which is also communal in such roles.

The guidance of goal layer meta-model is reflected in: guiding to distinguish the type of destination, such as functional goal, non-functional goal and operational goal; directing goal to decompose longitudinally; instructing to define the horizontal restraints relationship between goals; clearing the relationship with the elements of role layer model and further inducting to the process layer modeling.

2) Process Analysis of Application Specific The guidance of process layer meta-model is reflected in:  distinguishing the combinational process and atomic processes; determining the quality expectations of the process; guiding construction of the composite process on the basis of control structure; clearing input and output of the process as well as pre and post conditions.

3) Extracting Ontology of Electronic Document in Specific Areas  The role of ontology is reflected in: ontology as requirements specification. In other words, we establish ontology in specific areas, and provide knowledge base using the ontology for creating needs of multiple goal application system. In this case, ontology can be seen as a common domain model [8]. As the basis of establishing requirement specification of application system and system development in field, the reuse of knowledge can be performed.

In the domain modeling methods of RGPS, the basic output result is the domain knowledge base for domain modeling, including the domain ontology (O) and the domain model (RGPS). O represents domain ontology, including the domain entity ontology, domain operation ontology and domain situation ontology. The three categories ontology and their mutual semantic association ensure semantic collaboration between the domain models. Because web service is the basic units of network-based software, the structure of ontology must be taken into providing needs of semantic support for the web service. The relevant ontology in web service demands to define service parameters (data structure) and the type of service functions. In addition, the structure of ontology must also be taken into the need of modeling. In the goal modeling,  functional goals include three basic components: operation, object and method. The operation is the concept of the verb in the field, and the object is the concept of the noun in the field.



IV. CASE STUDY In e-government there are many relevant electronic  documents. There are two roles which are called the buyer and seller, the buyer is required by law to housing ownership transfer to the seller. The whole process of implementation involves a large number of electronic document, such as: the transfer of relevant laws and regulations, various document and a copy of the registration form, and so all kinds of information.

A. Role and Goal In this use case involves major roles include the buyer,  seller, official and so on. Buyer and seller in the process of civil service completed all housing transfer process and ultimately achieved the housing transfer targets under the guidance and assistance. In order to get the role of the e- government application scenario and target models,O-RGPS domain modeling tool was used,shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2.  The role and goal layer model of e-government use case  B. Analysis of housing transfer process Since the goal layer has a decomposition of the goals,  indicating the dependencies between the goals and therefore can be easily obtained in the process housing transfer layer model, shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3.  E-government process layer model  C. Electronic Document  Ontology In RGPS domain ontology, there are entity ontology and  operating ontology. Entity ontology describes the concepts and entities in the field of semantic relationship. Operating ontology defines the operational and functional concepts and their semantic relationships.

On the one hand, the concept of physical entities can be used as the data type of the service parameters, and the operating concept of the types of services can be provided. On the other hand, for the three elements of the functional objectives <operation, objects, methods>, the operation is the operation of the core concepts of the ontology, and the object is the core concepts. Thus, you can ensure that the target matching accuracy and completeness through semantic support of two types of ontology during the target search and matching.

Prot?g? is used to model the ontology. Prot?g? is a widely used ontology editing tool. It is an open source and Java-based Semantic Web ontology editor which provides an extensible architecture that allows user to create customized applications.

Electronic document associated with the domain ontology are constructed, shown in Figure 4.

V. RELATED WORKS Parallel database originated in the 1980s, and it was  supported by standard SQL and realized the many advanced technologies over the past 30 years. Parallel database used shared nothing architecture and divided relational tables between nodes horizontally. The goal of parallel database is high performance and high availability.

MapReduce was proposed in 2004 by Google for Big Data programming model. Initially MapReduce was mainly used for Internet data processing, such as document capture, inverted index creation, but now it is widely used in the machine learning, data mining, data analysis, and other fields because of its simple yet powerful data processing interface and massively parallel execution. MapReduce data processing tasks will be abstracted as a series of Map and Reduce. Map is mainly for data filtering operation, Reduce mainly to complete the data gathering operation. Input and output data are <key, value> format. Users simply follow their own familiar language to realize Map function and Reduce function, and MapReduce framework will automatically divide the tasks to be done in parallel.



VI. CONCLUSIONS This paper presents a Big Data modeling method oriented  electronic document, which is the core element model using ontology framework for knowledge representation of electronic document. Big Data model is built for electronic document, thus forming a Big Data reduction electronic document repository, for high quality to meet customer?s needs.
