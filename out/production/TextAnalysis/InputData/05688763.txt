Keywords-network security; data mining; intrusion detection  I INTRODUCTION  With the network playing more and more important effect in the modern society, crimes using computer network are presenting the obvious trend of escalation. How to establish a safe and strong network system and guarantee the security of important information has already become research focus. Formerly, many ways used is the firewall policy, it might prevent from many kinds of attacks, such as using the protocol weakness, the source route, the address counterfeited, and so on, and provide safe data channel. But it could do nothing about the back door in application layer, the attack or stealing caused by authority exceeding of internal user and the information damaging. Moreover, because the firewall was at the network boundary, its own design flaws are inevitably exposed to attackers, firewall  only is hard to resist the variety of attacks. Therefore, in order to guarantee the security of network system, one kind of technology that able to discover and report unauthorized or abnormal behavior was needed in the system, namely invasion detection system (IDS). In order to make IDS more efficiently and more fully and improve the efficiency and accuracy of intrusion detection, the data mining technology was introduced.

II INTRUSION DETECTION TECHNOLOGY INTRODUCTION  Intrusion detection technology was divided into two categories:  A Misuse Detection  Misuse Detection: Misuse Detection identify illegal invasion by the known attack methods and system vulnerabilities.. The main disadvantages of the methods is: because all known intrusion model have been implanted in the system, once any form of unknown intrusion appear, it cannot be detected. But detection efficiency of this method is high.

B Anomaly Detection  Anomaly Detection: Anomaly detection identify illegal invasion or authority exceeding by checking whether the current user behavior has been deviated from normal behavior profile established. The advantage of this method is no needing on understanding the defect of system, good adaptability. But the possibility of error is high.

The user behavior of intrusion detection system was showed by data form mainly. According to different sources of data, intrusion detection system can be divided into those ___________________________________      based on the host and those based on the network. The former?s data comes from the audit data of operating system and the latter?s data comes from packets through the network. Because the user's actions were showed by data, how to deal with the collected data correctly and effectively and draw conclusions are the core of problem.

III THE DATA MINING TECHNOLOGY  A  Data mining  Data Mining is to extract knowledge interested by people from large database or data warehouse, the knowledge is implied, unknown and potentially useful information.

Extracted knowledge is represented as concept, rule, law and model. The purpose of data mining is to help the decision-maker to find potential association between data, found neglected elements which are perhaps very useful for trends and decision-making behavior.

B Common data mining method and technology  a) Correlation Analysis: correlation analysis was also called association rules, it is to find item set model knowledge frequently appeared from given data set, the purpose is to excavation the relationship that was hidden in data, for example, the customers that buy computer will buy some software, this is an association rules.

b) Sequential patterns: it is similar with correlation analysis, the purpose is also to excavate connection that between data, however, time series analysis focused more on the relationship of data in times, for example, 80% people among printer buyer will buy printing paper after three months.

c) Classification: classification is to find model or function that can describe the typical characteristics of data set, so that it can identify ownership or categories of unknown data. Typical classify models have the linear regression model, the decision tree model, the model based on rule and the neural network model.

d) Clustering: Data was divided into a series of meaningful subset according to certain rules. In the same cluster, the gap between the individual is smaller, and in the different cluster, the gap is greater.

e) Deviation analysis: to find abnormal data from the database.

f)  Forecast: to find law according historical data, establish model, and to predict types, characteristics of the future data, etc based on the model.

IV INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM BASED ON THE DATA MINING TECHNOLOGY  A. Implementation process  The data mining technology was used in intrusion detection system, user?s behavior character was extracted and disciplinarian of intrusion behavior was summarized through the analysis for the historical data. Complete rules database established was used in intrusion detection. This process mainly divided into the following steps:  ? Data of test system that data collection based on network comes from network, the tools can be used have TCPDUMP etc.

? Accuracy of that user?s characteristics was extracted and rules was deduced was affected directly by quality of training data of data preprocessing in data mining, if behavior of intrusion was included in data that be used to establish model where in intrusion system, then, latter detection system was established can not make any behavior for this intrusion behavior, so causing omission. Therefore , data that be used train must not contain any intrusion, and was formatted into the form that could be dealt with by data mining algorithm .

? Data mining is the character or rules of user behavior was extracted from data was preteatmented, following to incorporate and update the rules that was gained, so the rules storeroom was established.

? The behavior of current user was detected by rules in rules storeroom that intrusion detection based on, and different handle means was adopted according to the results of getting.

B. Implementing case  Intrusion detection system was constructed based on correlation analysis method of data mining, this system is mainly used for anomaly detection. Steps are as follows:    a)  The data sources of this system is based on network, user?s data packet would be fetched through sniffer was emplaced in the network, then the protocol analysis method was introduced, the packet is discarded, the only header section was saved, data that was acquired after pretreatment according to specific methods include seven fields: time, source IP, the source port, purpose, the destination port, connect IP of ID, connection status.

b)  Because of three times handshake process was included of the TCP connection establishment, so some connection that was established unsuccessfully was included in all training data was collected , it would produce negative impact for the process of data mining later, so should be removed, and only save those of data that can reflect normal network. There is not exist this problem for UDP, only each UDP packets was regarded as a connection.

c)  APRIORI algorithm was used for data mining.

APRIORI algorithm is used in the analysis of shopping basket; it was used to find rules about that the "90% of customer when purchase goods A and also can buy goods B".

It was usually divided into two series: the form for output of rules is I1 & 12aI5 (support=2%, confidence=60%).

d)  Before the network traffic data that was collected was formated the input formats of APRIORI algorithm, with connection ID instead of customer ID , other attributes alternative goods purchased.  After be given support and confidence, can get a set of rules: 192.168.0.50 & 202.117.80.8 a80 (support=6 confidence 95 ) .

Meaning of rules is that IP of the source and destination is respectively 192.168.0.50 and 202.117.80.8 port of purpose is 80, support of the rules is 6% and credibility is 95%.

e)  Sampling of a period could not completely user behavior, so multiple sampling and repeat the process is necessary, then the merger method was used to incorporated rules set of many times get up until no longer generate new rules. The method was used and can extract more than 100 rules (support 2%, credibility and found 85 percent) from the data of network flow (28.8M),but many of them was found meaningless obviously, it needs administrator to streamline through personal experience, finally get the rules that can be used to test. So far, the rules generated can describe fully  behavior of users. The rules were used for intrusion detection. For example, one rule of the rule is 192.168.0.50 & 202.117.80.8 a80 (support=6 confidence 95 ), and in the process of test found source IP address connection in network data is 192.168.0.50 and purpose IP address is 202.117.80.8, access ports is 1000, this was explained violation of the rules of low probability events occurred, suspicious degree of the connection is increase. In the actual process, abnormal connection from the same IP address may violate many rules, when the number of suspicious degrees more than a threshold the alarm is produced by system.

Two groups of data were discussed for the system. One group is normal data that be known does not contain any attack (50M ,approximately 40 million record), this data was used for training system, and the introduced method above was adopted, in the confidence of setting that support is1% and credibility is 85% , the 17 inspection rules were got.

Then the rules was used to detect another group data known containing attacks (54M, including 63 million records), the experimental results showed that the method can effectively detect PROBING attack.

V CONCLUSION  With the rapid growth of the network bandwidth, means of hacker attacks have become increasingly diverse, existing intrusion detection system the reaction slower and less real time when network was intrusion. Therefore, how to instantly process the mass data in network and timely discover attack will become the next studying focus of intrusion detection system. The data mining technology was applied to the intrusion detection system, analysis based on historical data, the behavior of users was extracted, and the rule of intrusions behavior was summarized, more comprehensive knowledge base was established to intrusion detection. Experiments have proved that new attack type was detected effectively by intrusion detection system that data was data mining through APRIORI arithmetic, knowledge base was updated automatically, reliability of created rules is more high, so the efficiency and accuracy of the intrusion detection system was improved, and security of the network was enhanced.
