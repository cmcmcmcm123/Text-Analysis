Discovering Temporal Similarity Pattern Based on Metamorphosis Data

Abstract   This paper discusses a metamorphosis method for temporal data mining. We propose definition of temporal type and time granularity to divide into segments for time, then build an event temporal space which may describe something change of data over time. We give the conception of metamorphosis data in event temporal types space so that it is easier to discover valuable knowledge, but it is not clear to do it if original data are not metamorphosis. By metamorphosis data, we study a problem of knowledge discovery of temporal similarity pattern based on the temporal type is given. A method based on self- organizing map (SOM) to find similarity pattern is proposed.

1. Introduction   The temporal data mining has a wide spectrum for knowledge discovery, such as periodic patterns of stock movement, a temporal association rule of the two products, frequent sequences of  car manufacturing to signal jam detection. John and Myra introduced a framework for reviewing research related to temporal mining and have reviewed research contributions related to various aspects of the temporal data mining and knowledge discovery in detail [1]. The temporal data in the many fields is so complex that it is very difficult to mine useful knowledge. A feasible method is often used to reconstruct phase spaces, which can solve the prediction of complicated time series events [2].

Large amounts of time series data is produced routinely in a number of application areas, such as finance, economy, process industry, experimental  sciences, medicine, and monitoring of electrical distribution network disturbances. The analysis of such data is an important task to discover pertinent knowledge in data and hence time series data mining assumes significance and usefulness. There are many researches of similarity patterns in the field of molecular mechanisms (biology) [3], language acquisition (linguistics) [4], cancer diagnosis (medicine), etc[5]. But, papers of similarity patterns of temporal data mining are few. Dash, Nayak, Senapati and Lee did data mining for similarities in time series data by using wavelet-based feature vectors and neural networks [6].  Wang and Megalooikonomou discussed a dimensionality reduction technique for efficient time series similarity analysis [7].

Similarity pattern is a particularly interesting feature that could be used for understanding temporal data and predicting future trends. Similarity pattern mining should be an active research in the fields of data mining. It has wide applications, such as stock, consumption, weather, e-business and so on. In this paper, we define temporal data space as reconstructing phase spaces by metamorphosis data. In the metamorphosis temporal data space, we can discovery similarity pattern for complex time event to extend full or partial periodicity patterns.

2. Temporal Type and Time Granularity   There exist the temporal record in many real-world databases, and the length of time has a great impact on   DOI 10.1109/CIS.2009.71     the validity of the temporal association rules, cycle length and similarity sequence patterns.

Time in the real world is deemed to be limitless without beginning and ending. Time can be regarded as a real number axis, each point of which represents some moment, just like that described in physics. The interval from one point to another point can be viewed as some time. As a result, we call the moment in real world as absolute time tick (ATT), all of which constitute a real number set R (or time axis). In order to decide the real numbers which represent moment, we choose January 1, A.D.1 00:00:00 as the origin of the axis R and precision of every point on R is second or more precise unit. The interval from one point to another is called absolute time interval (ATI) which is a set of ATTs. For example, February 2, 2000 02:03:50 is an ATT and an ATI can be from February 2, 2000 00:00:00 to February 2,2000 24:00:00.

Now, we give a definition of temporal type as follows.

Definition 2.1 Let ?  be a mapping from a t to an  ATI ( )t? , i.e., 2RR ? , Rt ? , ( ) 2Rt? ? ? ( )t t?? . If  all of the following (1)-(4) are satisfied, then ?  is  called a temporal type and )(t?  is called the temporal factor of the temporal type ? .

(1) (Non-empty) ( )t? ? ? , for )(tt ?? .

(2) (Monotonous) For 21 tt <  and  1 2( ) ( )t t? ?? = ? ? then arbitrary  1' ( )t t??  and arbitrary 2" ( )t t?? , ' "t t<  holds, which is denoted by  )()( 21 tt ?? < .

(3) (Identical) For each ' ( )t t?? , ( ') ( )t t? ?=  .

(4) (Limitary) For each ' ( )t t?? , +?<'t .

The definition of temporal type in this paper is in several respects more general than the time models used in other papers. Obviously temporal type is clustering to time axis R and each temporal factor is an interval. Second, minute, hour, day, week, month and year which satisfy the above properties can be used to classify time axis R, and thus they are temporal type. If  )(t? ( Rt ? ) is only one point (i.e. time tick), then ?  is called atomic temporal type, otherwise ?  is called non-atomic temporal type. The temporal type usually used in our daily life is Non-atomic. The following properties are obtained according to the Definition2.1.

Property 2.1 If 21 tt ? , then ,)()( 21 ?=? tt ?? or )()( 21 tt ?? = .

Property 2.2 Let ?  be a non-atomic temporal  type and n  an integer. [ , ']T T  is a given absolute time interval. Then there exist n  real numbers 1 2, , , nt t t  with 1 2 nt t t< < < , which satisfy )(]',[ ?  n  i itTT  =  ? ? ,  therein whenever , {1, 2,... }i j n? with ji ? ,  ?=? )()( jtit ?? .

Property 2.3 For any Rt ? , sup ( )t?  and inf ( )t? , then inf ( )t? ?? it sup ( )t?  for all  ( )it t?? .

Then, we present the length of temporal factor ( )t? with the formula )(t? sup ( ) inf ( )t t? ?= ? . Clearly,  the actual measure of time axis depends on the time unit used in application under consideration. A year may be partitioned into 12 months, and also into 365 days. Which partition is more applicable? For example, in a geological database on sediments, days will be too fine as a time unit. So day is used to partition the time interval there. Basic temporal type helps to solve the aforementioned problem. Then, we give the definition and properties about basic temporal type.

Definition 2.2 Let ??,  be two temporal types. If  )(|)(| tt ?? <  holds for any t R? , which is called temporal type ?  less than temporal type ? . For any temporal factor )(t? of ? , if there is only one temporal factor of ? , noted as )'(t? , such that  )'()( tt ?? ? ,  then ? is called a basic temporal type of ? .

Obviously second is the basic temporal type of minute, hour, day, week, month, quarter and year. That is, each second falls entirely within one minute, one hour, one day and so on. Likewise hour is the basic     temporal type of day, week, month, quarter and year.

The rest may be deduced by analogy. Whereas week is not the basic temporal type of month due to the overlap of temporal factors, i.e. a month can start in the middle of a week. For example, the fifth week of January 2003, i.e. from January 26, 2003 to February 1, 2003, falls in January   and February.

Property 2.4 Let the temporal types ? be a basic temporal type of ? . Then for any )(t?  of ? , there exist n  real numbers 1 2, ,..., nt t t  with 1 2 nt t t< < <  such that )()( ?  n  i itt  =  = ?? , where ?=? )()( jtit ?? ,  , {1, 2,... }i j n?  with ji ? . ? =  = n  i itvt  )()(?   holds.

Definition 2.3 Let ? be a non-atomic temporal type and ?  a basic temporal type of ? . And  )()( ?  n  i itt  =  = ??  therein 1 2 nt t t< < <  and whenever  , {1, 2,... }i j n?  with ji ? , ?=? )()( jtit ?? . So  the relative length of  ( )t?  to v  is n , which is denoted by Re ( ( ))llen t n?? = .

Definition 2.4 Let ?  be a non-atomic temporal type and ? a basic temporal type of ? . Then we have the following definitions:  (1) If the lengths of all temporal factors of ? are equal, ?  is called a time granularity.

(2) If ? is a time granularity, then ? is called a basic time granularity of ? .

(3) If all temporal factors ( )it? of ?  can be classified as finite classes in accordance with the length of ( )it? , ?  is called a coarse time granularity.

(4) If ? is a coarse time granularity, ? is called a basic coarse time granularity of ? .

Any time granularity is coarse time granularity.

We can conclude the following corollary according to the property 2.2.

Corollary 2.1 Any given time interval can be covered by finite time factors of any coarse time granularity.

So, the temporal types often used in our daily life such as second, minute, hour, day and week are time granularities, while the temporal types such as month, quarter and year are only coarse time granularities because the lengths of all their temporal factors are different. Obviously second, minute, hour and day are the basic time granularities of month, quarter and year.

Basic time granularity is often used to measure other time granularities or coarse time granularities. For example, in stock statistic second and day are often used as basic granularities to describe the trend of stock fluctuation. Also we can use coarse time granularity to measure other time granularities or coarse time granularities. Month has four different lengths, i.e. 28 days, 29 days, 30 days and 31 days. A quarter which has four different lengths has three months. A year which has two different lengths has twelve months or four quarters.

3. Discovering Temporal Similarity Pattern in Event Temporal Types Space   Let A be a set of objectives, denoted by  ),,,( 21 mAAAA = , where each iA  (i=1,2?,m) has  the same attributes 1 2{ , , }qS S S S= , and each  attribute iS  (i=1,2?q)  includes many values e. The value e may be finite or infinite number (or symbol). A  value ie  ( i =1,2,?,q) of attribute iS  is called a state  of iS . All values ie  of state are denoted by a set Ei.

Let ),,,(~ 21 qeeee = , qEEEE ???= 21 , then  ( ,iA e ) is called an event. Then ( A ,E) is called event types space of objective A which consists of all event  types ( ,iA e ). Let ?  be a temporal type, then  ))(,~,( tveAi  is called a temporal event for objective  iA  at temporal factor )(t? .  ( A ,E,? )  is called event temporal types space.

For example, some stock can be defined as objects sets. Each stock has some attributes such as opening price, closing price, selling deal and so on. Each price  has real number. ))(,~,( tveAi =(Stock A,     (10.00,10.12,45000),20/08/2006) means that Stock A has  as opening price 10.00, closing price 10.12, selling deal 45000 on August,20,2006.

In fact, a temporal event may be a record in database. We can discover some knowledge by mining these temporal data. But,  there are too many anomalistic data in temporal database so that it is very difficult to discover  valuable knowledge, such as the price of stock. We need change value of attribute into other value so that we can easily find out some valuable knowledge, such as temporal associate rule, approximate period.  We give definition the metamorphosis of data.

Definition 3.1 Let  ( A ,E,? )  and ( A ,E?, ? ) be event temporal types space, where ?  is a basic temporal type of ? . Let a map i?  : i iE ?? ,  where  i?  is also state value of each attribute iS . All values  of state i?  is denoted by a set  Ei?, )',,','(' 21 qEEEE = .  Then ),,,( 21 q???? =  is  called a metamorphosis of data from E to E? for ( ,? ? ). When  v ?= ,  ),,,( 21 q???? =  is called a metamorphosis of data from E to E?.

Let A={A1, A2, ?, Am} be a set of finite attributes. Suppose that v is a temporal type, an event that an attribute Ai happens in state e at the temporal factor v(t) is represented as (Ai, e, v(t)).

Let a set  1 1 2 2( , ) {( , , ( )), ( , , ( )), , ( , , ( ))}i i i i J JA e v A e v t A e v t A e v t= ( 1 2 Jt t t< < < ) denotes an event sequence for state  je  to  attribute Ai  at  v(tj), j=1,2,?,J. All event  sequence set is denoted by ( , )e vA .

Definition 3.2  Let any two ( ', '), ( ', ')i iA e v A e v  ( , )e v? A  . Let a metamorphosis map : [0,1]E? ? .

For given number ? , let  1 2( ) ( ( ), ( ),x e e e? ?=  ...., ( ))Je?  and 1 2( ') ( ( '), ( '),...., ( '))Jx e e e e? ? ?= ,  ( ) ( ')x e x e ?? ? . Then  ( ', ')iA e v  is called temporal  similarity to ( , )iA e v  for ? . Let a set  TSJ( ( , )iA e v ) be  temporal similarity pattern to ( , )iA e v  for ? , where  each ( ', ')iA e v  in  TSJ ( ( , )iA e v ) is temporal similarity  to ( , )iA e v  for ? , when number of  element in  TSJ  ( ( , )iA e v ) is enough big.

When 1 2 Je e e= = =  , each ( , )iA e v  in  TSJ( ( , )iA e v ) is a repeated sequence to occur. Each  event sequence in TS( ( , )iA e v ) means similarity law of  continuous state under different temporal factors if there is not any temporal factor between ( )jv t  and  1( )jv t +  for all j=1,2,?,J-1. If there are all same  number of temporal factors between ( )jv t  and 1( )jv t +  for all j=1,2,?,J-1, TSJ ( ( , )iA e v ) is a similarly period  pattern. On the other hand, let  pjj+1 be number of temporal factors between ( )jv t  and 1( )jv t + . If p12 =  p23 =?=pJ-1J, then TS( ( , )iA e v ) is a similarity period  pattern when all state are same in TSJ ( ( , )iA e v ).

We propose a method based on self-organizing  map (SOM) to find similarity pattern in ( , )e vA . The SOM consists of disciplinarian neuron of two dimensional matrix m?m, which a weight vector from a  input vector Xi (= ( )x e ) to each neuron or connected unit j in output layer is defined as a vector wij, where the dimension value of Xi is equal to that of wij. The number of neuron from ten to thousand decides efficiency and validity of the SOM. The  training algorithm of SOM is as follows:  Step 1. Give a training set ( , )e vA  and ? , a metamorphosis map : [0,1]E? ? , then we obtain set  { ( )x e }.

(a) In each step of the iterative training, choose an  event sequence Xi { ( )}x e?   as input vector and compute distances from vector Xi to all units of SOM so that  the winner unit, denoted by wib, is obtained.

Here, wib is the closest vector to Xi  among all vectors { wij }, i.e.,  ||Xi-wi b ||= minj ||Xi-wij||                         (1)  (b) Select weigh value wij of point in the neighborhood of the winner b to close input vector by training SOM. The iteration equality is satisfied in grid as follows.

wij(k+1)=wij(k)+ ? (k)[Xi-wij (k)]                   (2) where k is the number of iteration, ? (k) is learning rate in (0,1). Additionally, wij approaches to Xi , when k increases.

(c) Then, we repeat  (a) and  (b) till all event sequences are trained.

(d) Get all mapping structure set {wij} of all input  vector Xi with corresponding to  ( , )e vA  which is  equal to classification Cij.

Step 2.  Find all temporal similarity patterns  TSJ( ( , )iA e v ).

(a)  Let i=1, j=1, TSij( ( , )iA e v )= ? .

(b)  For all ( , )iA e v ? Cij, if  ( ) ijx e ?? ?w /2,  then  ( , )iA e v  is added into set TSij( ( , )iA e v ).

(c)  For i?i+1,j?j+1, repeat  (b) till i=j=m.

According to the above algorithm, TSij( ( , )iA e v )  is a temporal similarity to ( , )iA e v  for ? , because  ( ) ( ') ( ) ( ')ij ijx e x e x e x e ?? ? ? + ? ?w w .

Let denote TSJ( ( , )iA e v )={TSij( ( , )iA e v )}. For given different ? , we may obtain different temporal similarity patterns TSJ( ( , )iA e v ).

4. Conclusions   This paper proposes definition of temporal type and time granularity to divide into segments for time. We build an event temporal space which may describe something change of data at temporal type, such as similarity pattern. We give the conception of metamorphosis data in event temporal types space so that it is easier to discover valuable knowledge. And we present the similarity pattern on the basis of temporal type. And lastly, we discuss a clustering  algorithm based on self-organizing map to detect temporal similarity pattern. The algorithm of this paper has discovered some similarity patterns in the web data. It is very significant in the practical application in the web page couldn?t be commonly found. A future work direction will be to extend the work that looks for other pattern on multi-attribute and multiple time granularities. Another interesting extension of our work will be the development of the algorithm to raise its efficiency.
