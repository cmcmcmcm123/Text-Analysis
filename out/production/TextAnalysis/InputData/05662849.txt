I.  INTRODUCTION  With the development of GIS, GIS data grows rapidly. In order to achieve the full utilization of the information, how to share and interoperate data becomes a serious problem.

The mapping from geodatabase to the Geo-ontology could provide context-sensitive semantics for different geographic data, and thus the interoperability in heterogeneous geographic data become truly.

Recently, the ontology becomes more concerned and the research of Geo-ontology graphical has many results. It?s mainly concentrated on geographic information integration, discovery and retrieval, etc. However, the study of building Geo-ontology is still in the phase of hand-building, auxiliary building. To achieve the automatic construction of  Geo-ontology, this article starts at the difficulty of building Geo-ontology ? studies the mapping from geodatabase to the Geo-ontology, makes mapping rules from the geodatabase to the Geo-ontology which adapted to the geographical area based on the analysis and comparison of mapping method from a relational data model to the ontology, and takes spatial database of river basin as an example to illuminate the construction of Geo-ontology.



II. THE RESEARCH OF FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC  As the important role that Geo-ontology plays was recognized, foreign and domestic research institutions and scholars started to pay attention ontology research, and there are lots of results in the data model and ontology mapping research. As the complexity of geographic data?s relationship, there are more research in relational database model and inter-ontology mapping.

A.  Foreign  1) On behalf of the early research about relational database schema and ontology mapping is: Vrije University of the Netherlands developed a web-based access method mapping tools in 2004--FDR2#Kit [2].

The map building process can be divided into three steps:  a) According to the relational database to establish the corresponding relational database schema;  b) Automatically change the relational database schema into ontology in the form of expression;   DOI 10.1109/WISM.2010.127     c) Users manually build a relational database model and simple inter-ontology mappings, and expressed in the form RD Map in the end.

2) Onto Grate [3] was developed at the University Oregon  United States in 2006, which was a relational database model and inter-ontology mapping system. It consists of six mainly functional modules: syntax converter, map generation module, reasoning module, learning module, excavation module, the user interface module. Its implementation process as following: At first use the syntax converter and convert relational database models and ontology to the middle of the model which uses Web-PDDL language to describe respectively, and then complemented by human involvement, built the mapping between the two intermediate models by mapping generation module.

B.  Domestic  1) MASON [5] was developed as a common inter-relational database models and ontology mapping tool in Southeast University, 2006. It is to use pre-defined transformation rules firstly, convert the relational database schema and the ontology to the intermediate model, then take in the string compare-based mapping algorithm and the structure-based of SF algorithms, at last search between the simple corresponding in the elements and output.

2) Zhuo-Ming Xu [6] given a semantics-preserving way from the ER model to OWL DL ontology. This method limits single inheritance between the entities based on the formalized representation of ER model, and establishes the corresponding concept between ER model and OWL DL ontology. It achieves mode conversion by an algorithm which in accordance with a predefined set of mapping rules, and develops ER2WO.

C.  Analysis and Comparison  From the above research situation between foreign and domestic, generally the mapping between relational database schema and ontology can be divided as follows:  1) Directly extract the ontology from the relational database. Its advantages and disadvantages: Directly extracted ontology from a relational database, had a high degree of automation, the transformation between the data  model and ontology can be achieved by just make a database mapping rules. The relationship between the data model which implicit in the entities can be able to demonstrate clearly, and the database data change into ontology instances. However, as the database schema and the ontology structure is not completely consistent, direct extraction ontology is not necessarily able to obtain the required one. It?s mainly applicable to the automatic ontology building in a small amount of data.

2) Convert through intermediate models between relational databases and ontology. Its advantages and disadvantages: The conversion method that through intermediate model between relational databases and ontology, which can truly achieve the semantic representations between the database schema and the ontology. However, it is more complex and less automated, and requires a pre-given correlation exists between the ontology and database. It?s mainly applied to the area to switch between different data models.



III.  GEO-ONTOLOGY AND GEODATABASE  A.  Geo-ontology  Ontology is a philosophy, information science concept, which is introduced to the geographical area of science, Geo-Ontology refers to the geographical areas of knowledge, information and data are abstracted into one common nature of an object or entity, and makes a treatment of clear definition and conceptualization, ultimately, gives formal expression of the theory and method [1].

In general, Geo-ontology includes: geographic areas of concepts (classes), a concept as well as the geographical characteristics of the relationship between the data (instances). The concepts which exist in Geo-ontology are not isolated between them there is a certain level of relations and semantic relations. Geo-Ontology not only has the general properties of identity, but also has the unique spatial characteristics. In addition to need describe the attribute information, the Geo-ontology also need describe the geographic information in spatial information, as the location relationship, topological relationship, and the relationship between part and whole.

B.  Geodatabase  Geodatabase refers to a region on the characteristics of a certain geographical elements of data collection. Spatial data are generally stored as vector data, raster data, as well as in the traditional sense of the property sheet. An RDBMS table can be used to store an element of the collection, and each row in the table is to save an element, which the Shape field is, storage space for elements of geometry or shape information. However, Raster and image data are stored in relational tables.



IV.   BUILDING THE GEO-ONTOLOGY BASED ON THE GEODATABASE  Traditionally, the ways of building the ontology mostly rely on handcrafted tools to achieve after analyzing the database structure and table content, it is possible in the case of small amount of data. However, geographic data has a great amount of complex spatial relationships, building corresponding Geo-ontology is an extremely complex, time-consuming and labor-intensive process following the traditional method. Building the Geo-ontology should be creating a new approach according to the characteristics and storage of geographical data. Automatic building ontology becomes a new direction for building a Geo-ontology because of greatly reducing the workload in the process.

Below, we analyze the existence of difficulties on the automatic building process, set down mapping rules between geodatabase and Geo-ontology, and initially achieve the automatic building of Geo-ontology by programmed algorithm according to the rules.

A.   The difficulties of Semantic Association  There is a certain link between geodatabase and Geo-ontology. Geodatabase contains multiple data tables, which has 1 vs. 1, 1 vs. multiple, multiple vs. multiple relationships. Each data sheet is made up of a number of fields, and records are the field value in the table; Geo-ontology contains more than one class, and there is a certain level of relationship among classes; each class has multiple attributes, and instances are the collection of attribute values.

Figure1 the relation of the geodatabase and the geo-ontology  This provides the basis for mapping from geodatabase to the Geo-ontology. However, geodatabase and Geo-ontology model are not entirely consistent; there are still many difficulties to truly realize the corresponding semantic association despite of a simple mapping. The main difficulties are:  1) How to select Geo-ontology concepts (classes) from multiple tables in the geodatabase, and establish the hierarchy of concepts.

2) How to determine the relationship among concepts (classes). It is mainly the spatial relationships between concepts, namely, topology, location relationship.

3) How to obtain instances for building the Geo-ontology from vast amounts of geographic data in the geodatabase.

B.  Establish the Mapping Rules  OWL is an ontology language, which is defined and instanced, and it use object-oriented approach to describe the domain knowledge, describe the character and relation of classes and attributes through axioms and constraints.

According the ability of expression and calculation, OWL can be divided into three seeds Language: OWL Lite, OWL DL and OWL Full. OWL DL support users that need the strongest expression in the reasoning system, which can guarantee the integrality and decidability of calculation.

Considering further study after building the Geo-ontology, this paper uses OWL DL as Geo-ontology description language.

Based on the above understanding, we can use OWL language to describe and express the concepts and their relationships, and establish the mapping rules from the geodatabase to the Geo-ontology:     1) Analysis geospatial data table in geodatabase, study out the table name as the important concepts of the domain, and select the key concept to express the domain knowledge as much as possible. In the concepts, refer the categories of basic geographic information to determine the level of their relationship; finally, the selected concept will be mapped Geo-ontology class or sub-class:  A data table T ?<owl:Class  rdf:ID= TName/>; Many data tables (for example, two data tables) T1, T2,  there is "father-son" relationship, T2 is T1 sub-categories ?<owl:Class  rdf:ID="T2Name">  <rdfs:subClassOf> <owl:Class  rdf:ID="T1Name"/>  </rdfs:subClassOf> </owl:Class>  2) In the geodatabase, the attribute information is stored in the data tables in form of field; field is mapped to Geo-ontology?s data type property:  Field that contains the attribute information F ?<owl:DatatypeProperty  rdf:ID="FName/">  3) Spatial relations can be mapped to object properties in the geodatabase, and it describes the spatial relations of geographic elements by defining the domain and range of attribute:  Field that contains the spatial relationship F, geographical factors A1, A2 exist spatial relationships ? <owl:ObjectProperty  rdf:ID="FName ">  <rdfs:domain  rdf:resource="A1?A2?" /> <rdfs:range  rdf:resource=" A2?A1?" /> </owl:ObjectProperty> In addition, the spatial relations can also describe by the  multi-nested structure of OWL ontology. It is able to express clearly the spatial relationships of geographic factors, but there are many difficulties to achieve, especially a large amount of data.

4) In the geodatabase, records are mapped to Geo-ontology instances. Field names are mapped to the name of ontology instance, attribute data are mapped to the DatatypeProperty value of ontology instance; the spatial data are mapped to ObjectProperty value.

C.  Building River Basin Geo-ontology  According to the mapping rules from the geodatabase to Geo-ontology, using water spatial database of river basin as an example, we can build river basin Geo-ontology by the Java programming language and Jena tools. Specific methods: firstly, obtain the geo-ontological structure from water spatial database of river basin based on the mapping rule; and then use the ontology building tools to optimize the structure of Geo-ontology; finally, records which were stored in the database are mapped to instances of Geo-ontology. Therefore, the appropriate river basin Geo-ontology creates.

The description is that tables of spatial database of river water correspond to the Geo-ontology class:   The description is that fields of water spatial database of  river basin correspond to the Geo-ontology properties (including spatial relations):   The description is that records of water spatial database of  river basin correspond to instances of Geo-ontology:      ?????? In Protege3.4, display the water Geo-ontology of river  basin:

V.   CONCLUSION  The building of Geo-ontology is a huge and complex process. At present, there are not yet fully mature in theory and in practice, and we need to further research and development. Based on geodatabase, Geo-ontology theory, we analysis the current mapping method from the relational database to ontology, try and put forward the mapping rules from the geodatabase to the Geo-ontology and build the  corresponding Geo-ontology by the rules based-on water spatial data of river basin. This is only the first step of solving GIS application in interoperability, more research and work will be done on the semantic reasoning and search of the GIS applications in the future.
