Interpolation Results in the Split Inversion Neural Network Algorithm

ABSTRACT  An advantage of a neural network over a look-up table is the ability to  act as a higher form of associative memory.

For example, a network in addition to giving correct results for the pattern examples that are used to train the network, can also perform sophisticated interpolation. In this paper neural networks trained with the split inversion neural net- work algorithm are shown to provide complex interpolation when used as associative memories. The neural network is applied to the design of a beam-truss-spring structure.

The results obtained using the neural network algorithm are shown to be superior to those of a look-up table.

INTRODUCTION  obtained with the neural network algorithm and the look up table are discussed, compared and the superiority of neural networks illustrated.

SPLIT INVERSION LEARNING ALGORITHM  The concept for the split inversion algorithm was ex- plained in reference [a].  The considerable speed advantage of this algorithm over the backpropagation algorithm was described by the author in reference [3]. The split inversion algorithm in contrast to the backpropagation algorithm [4] computes the weights for both the output and the hidden layers so as to  minimize the square error at the output of the network [ 5 ] .

A least square solution for a weight update-increment vector Aw may be computed for all weights at the same time using conjugate gradients [5] from  AAw = d (1)  where A is computed from derivatives of the outputs with respect to the weights and d is an output error vector. The weights are updated at  the I th iteration  Computer aided engineering design tools are good for analyzing a hypothesised design but are of little help in cre- ating the design in the first place. Expert systems could be applied to  the design task but these are proving to be wiuij(l+ 1 )  = W i j ( 1 )  + Awtj(1) (2)  APPLICATION T O  BEAM-TRUSS-SPRING DESIGN  cumbersome. This is because whenever an expert increases his expertise, new rules must be added to the existing sys- tem that do not conflict with them. Addition of more rules makes the system slower and less efficient.

Neural networks have advantages for engineering design.

The concept of associative memory which is an integral part of human expertise is inherent in neural networks [l]. As- sociative memories unlike conventional memories can asso- ciate a new situation with previous ones. The neural net- work provides a higher form of associative memory than a look-up table because of its ability to provide complex interpolation.

It will be shown in this paper that the split inversion neural network algorithm can exhibit this higher form of associative memory when applied to the design of engineer- ing systems. An example from structural design, a beam- truss-spring, is used to illustrate this property. The results  A beam-truss-spring is considered from structural engi- neering, figure 1. It is simple to compute the deflections U under a loading p for a specific structure for which the lengths of the members I and their stiffnesses s are known.

In general the solution is not unique and may not be computable. The rea- son is that  the design parameters are distributed throughout the equations and may arise in a complicated manner, e.g.

length arises with powers in B, figure 2. The uniqueness issue is bypassed by fixing certain parameters.

B(1,s)u = p (3)  Input  Load IP, to P,) lection (U, to U,)  A neural network may be constructed and trained to perform the inversion or design problem. The sequence of actions taken to train the neural network are as follows:  1. Compute the matrix B in equation (3), figure 2, using a selected stiffness vector s and length 1 .

2. Use equation (3) with load vector p to compute cor- responding deflection vector U.

3. Repeat 1 and 2 with other design parameters s and I and with other load vectors p.

4. Associated vectors are determined where load and de- flection vectors are concatenated to form an input vec- tor and the corresponding stiffness vector and length form the output vector.

5. The network is trained using the split inversion algo- rithm for these sets of input and output vectors.

The network will now provide at  the output a length and stiffness vector given a deflection vector and load vector at the input. Further, the deflection vector and load vector need not be one of those used for training. The network will interpolate to  handle those that fall between training cases.

The network is trained with four design examples. In the recall phase, if the network is given any input pattern that it has been trained with, the net- work responds with the corresponding output pattern. The question addressed next is the behavior when an input is provided that was not one used in training.

In order to demonstrate interpolation, the stiffness of the structure and the load were kept constant and the length 1 is the only design parameter to be estimated. Let us consider  two input training patterns, say pattern two and pattern four, named because they correspond to a design length of two and four respectively. The rms values of the deflection vectors corresponding to patterns two and four are plot- ted against their corresponding design lengths as the dark squares a t  the extremeties of the lines in figure 4.

Now assume that we wish to estimate a design length for a deflection that is midway between that for pattern two and that for pattern four. We consider every element of the deflection vector t o  be midway between those for the two pat terns.

If a look-up table is used, a length midway between that for pattern two and pattern four would be selected, that is three. This is shown as a linear interpolation by the dark square labelled linear interpolation in figure 4. It is obvious from the beam-truss-spring design equations (3) and the matrix, figure 2 that the deflection vector is not linearly related to the length so that this solution is not likely to be very good.

If the midway deflection vector is input to the trained neural network, a different design length is obtained, la- belled neural network output and marked with an open box in figure 4. This can be shown to be superior to the lin- ear result as follows. The design length obtained is used to determine the matrix B, figure 2. Equation (3) is used to compute a deflection vector. The rms of this deflection vector is computed and plotted as the actual value in fig- ure 4. The result is close to the nonlinear interpolated re- sult obtained from the neural network. This shows that the network produces a better interpolation than that obtained from the linear interpolation with the look-up table.

In practice it is always possible to determine the accu- racy of the interpolation by using the interpolated design with analysis tools to see how well the resulting design meets its specification.

CONCLUSIONS  This paper showed that the split inversion neural net- work algorithm can provide accurate interpolation for non linear situations that would be difficult to obtain with a look-up table. The nonlinear relations need never be known.

The network learns these from training with representative examples. The discretization of the parameters used in ob- taining training samples and the nature of the underlying equations determine the accuracy of the interpolation. This approach was shown to be valuable for engineering design where expertise is often dependent on association with pre- vious designs rather than by following a set of rules.
