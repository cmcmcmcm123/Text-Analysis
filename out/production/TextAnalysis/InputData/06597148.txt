Characterization of 3G Data-plane Traffic and Application towards Centralized  Control and Management for Software Defined Networking

Abstract?With the wide deployment of 3G/4G cellular data networks there is a tremendous growth of mobile Internet access worldwide. We conduct a detailed measurement study about user behaviors, application usage and location patterns of users. We present a methodology that correlates different network attributes and user information together. For user behaviors we classify all users into four groups by time division and investigate the behaviors of different types of users. For example, we find that midnight users consume tremendous network bandwidth. We categorize applications into several groups and provide insights of each type of application usage about up/down flow user numbers and user request times. We also analyze the location information of users that reveal the relationship between network usages with user mobility. Our study successfully provides network operational insights with the details of network usage or the user remarkable behaviors that can help network planners and operators to plan and adaptively adjust network capacity assignment and flow or application management. Most importantly it will help service providers to reduce their operating cost and offer more flexible and variety of services to meet the needs of today?s mobile clients without the need of increasing capacity in congested areas. Finally, our analysis will enable much more efficient routing and resource allocation management applications in the recent endeavor for software defined networking that will put such responsibility into the logically centralized controllers.

I. INTRODUCTION Third-generation and fourth-generation mobile  networks are becoming an increasingly important component of the global telecommunications infrastructure. The functional complexity inherited from the cellular paradigm, coupled with the openness of the TCP/IP world [1]. There are many types of devices that enable mobile Internet access, such as tablet computers, laptops with WiFi or attached data cards, and smartphones. On the other hand, the number and popularity of mobile applications has been rising dramatically due to the accelerating rate of adoption of smartphones or pads. For example, Android has 150K apps and 350K daily activations [2]. Moreover, 3G deployments continue to evolve: network equipment undergo regular software and hardware upgrades to increase capacity and add  new features, users? behavior changes significantly with the broad acceptance of new applications [3]. Compared to traditional wire networks, cellular networks not only have relatively limited data-plane link capacity, but also have higher control-plane overhead that increases the loading of the network core [4].

The emergence of software defined networking (SDN) has sparked significant interest in rethinking classical approaches to network architecture and design. By providing a well-defined programming interface to the network (e.g., Open-Flow [5]), SDN separates data forwarding with the control logic that traditionally resides inside individual routing or switching devices, and centralize the routing and other control in the centralized controller [6], and running other management applications on top of the controller. On the other hand, Network management involves two important stages: (1) measuring the network and then (2) adjusting the control of the network accordingly. While there have been many efforts on designing the right APIs for network control, little thought has gone into considering measurement and analysis. Since control and measurement are two important halves of network management, it is important to measure and analysis the traffic characterization of network.

From the perspectives of network operators, it is important to understand the traffic patterns of different applications and usage patterns. Since HTTP is the dominant protocol in mobile Internet applications, we specifically study characterization of user behaviors and applications in such an environment. Understanding those characterization and traffic patterns can shed light on how to provision network resources, and enable much more efficient routing in the recent endeavor for software defined networking that will put such responsibility into the logically centralized controllers. These findings can also suggest that cloud platforms that host mobile application servers leverage distinct usage patterns in classes of apps to maximize the utilization of their resources.

In this paper, we conduct an in-depth measurement analysis on the traffic of different users and applications of a commercial 3G UMTS network deployed in a southern city in China. At the core of 3G network, we collect and analyze a 24x7 hour span IP data packets, which correspond to data- plane. In contrast to previous work, we use signatures based on HTTP headers to distinguish the traffic from different  2013 IEEE International Congress on Big Data  DOI 10.1109/BigData.Congress.2013.44     apps. Due to the format of User-Agent in HTTP headers when mobile apps use standard platform APIs, this technique gives us the ability to gather statistics about each individual app, not just categories of network traffic characterized by port number. We identify more than 2M users per day on average, as well as different IP applications. The extensive scales of our datasets allow us to conduct comprehensive analysis. In summary, we make the following three contributions: ? We analyze the dataset in four parts: overview, user  behaviors, application characteristics and locations. We compare different day?s network usages and reveal the common scenarios and differences. We category users into four groups by time span division and make the observations in user behaviors of each kind. We conduct a classification in application types by distinguishing the content type. Correlating the application types to other attributes like data flow and user?s id, our study shows the key difference of application services in several perspectives.

Furthermore, we identify that users who use mobile Internet service in more different locations will have more traffic contribution and thus more consumption of network bandwidth. By clustering base stations, we present some features of location from flow and account aspects.

? When we monitor a large volume of traffic data for detailed statistics, a long period or a large-scale network, it is difficult to handle Tera or Peta-byte traffic data with a single server. Our data preprocess is implemented by using Hive, a data warehouse system for Hadoop that facilitates easy data summarization and the analysis of large datasets stored in distributed Hadoop compatible file systems. This allows us to parallelize the data extraction and group operation.

Moreover, we use Mahout to implement parallel data mining method like K-means clustering algorithm.

? The data set that we use to study traffic characterization is significantly more diverse geographically and in user base than previous studies. It converse hundreds of thousands of smart phones in this 3G network. This allows us to make more generalizable conclusions about smartphone usage patterns.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related work on 3G traffic measurement. In section 3 we present our traffic analysis framework. In section 4 we describe the datasets and preprocessing. Section 5 presents our findings from the datasets. Finally, a few concluding remarks are given in Section 6.



II. RELATED WORK There have been a small number of studies focusing on  Internet traffic in 3G mobile networks. Svoboda et al. [7] analyze various aspects of GPRS and UMTS traffic using anonymous header traces. They study traffic volume per user and protocol mix. In terms of protocol mix, they find that HTTP is the dominant protocol with 40?60 % of traffic.

They discover that the global traffic composition is relatively  stable on a daily basis, with some moderate differences between weekends and working days. Heikkinen et al. [8] analyze P2P usage from passive UMTS header traces in Finland from 2005?2007. Web traffic accounts for 57?79% of bytes from mobile hand-held devices, email for 10?24%, and P2P is not noticeable. However, they point out that a notable growing trend for computer-based P2P file sharing traffic is visible in GSM/UMTS networks. Ridouxet al. [9] collects data from a CDMA2000 network, and compares the similarities and differences with wire line data traffic.

Williamson et al. [10] analyze packet/data call event traces from a CDMA2000 net-work from 2004. They focus their analysis on link-layer behavior, session properties, and user mobility. Their results also identify power-law properties in several traffic characteristics.

Several studies have analyzed TCP performance and low-level traffic characteristics in GPRS and CDMA data networks [11]. Other studies analyze the content requested or available for mobile devices. Kilpi and Lassila [12] analyze the round-trip times of TCP flow data collected at a GPRS/UMTS network. Using data from 2000, Adya et al.

[13] analyze the Web server logs of a major commercial site and study the requests of mobile clients. They find that stock quotes, news, and yellow pages were the most commonly accessed content in their traces. The DARWIN group collects IP packets at a GPRS/UMTS core network, and analyzes various issues such as TCP performance [14].They find that the frequency of re-transmission events is a powerful indicator for the specific type of bottleneck under study, and it can be used to provide early warning about future occurrences of similar events. Verkasalo [15] studies how Symbian phone features are used by instrumenting the handset. He finds that the camera feature and games are the most common multimedia applications. Timmins et al. [16] use active measurements to crawl the Web for sites offering specialized content for mobile devices.

Several studies analyze web-application usage and data traffic behavior in 3G networks. Trestian et al. [17] analyzes mobility and web-application usage in a 3G network from a metropolitan area. They characterize web-application usage by counting the number of HTTP request and find that social networking, music, and e-mail are the most common web.

However, they do not asses who many users utilize a particular application. Huang et al. [18] propose a tool called 3GTest, which runs on thousands of smart phones over a wide geographic coverage. Each 3GTest-enabled device generates probe traffic to measure the network performance.

They also design a set of experiments to quantify how application performance, in particular web browsing, is impacted by various factors, and where the performance bottleneck is. Falaki et al. [19] study the smart phone traffic and identify the differences of user behavior based on the traces collected from a number of individual devices. They find that browsing contributes most traffic, lower layer protocols have a high overhead due to small transfer sizes, and packet loss is the primary bottleneck for traffic throughput. Gember et al. [20] compare handheld and non- handheld devices in a campus WiFi network. They study of the differences in the content and flow characteristics of     handheld versus non-handheld traffic. Xu et al. [21] analyze the IP data traffic collected inside a tier-1 network core, and study the usage behavior of a variety of smart phone applications from the operator's perspective. They identify traffic from distinct marketplace apps based on HTTP signatures and present aggregate results on their spatial and temporal prevalence, locality, and correlation. He et al. [22] analyzes the data/control-plane performance of different device types using massive traces collected from the core of a 3G UMTS city-wide network. They present a methodology that studies the interactions of different data/control-plane datasets, and make several key observations from their analysis. They well used the control-plane dataset but what they find is lack of location information and their dataset is from 2010 which cannot match the nowadays mobile network situation very well. Our work complements the prior studies by also analyzing the data-plane performance.

Specifically, we study data traffic behavior in HTTP level including location information and our dataset is very new.

Visualization  Physical and Virtual Network Infrastructure  User behaviors  Application  Location  Overview  Figure 1.Analysis Framework To better show our analysis process and the position in  SDN network we here put Figure 1 to make an illustration first. The whole system consists of physical and virtual network infrastructure and SDN-enabled network controller layers. The real network state and information are generated in physical and virtual network infrastructure and our analysis dataset is just a subset of them. SDN controller (such as the Smart Openflow Controller (SOX) [6]) centralizes the network intelligence and maintains a global view of the network. They offer a flexible software defined network management in a simplicity and reliability way.

The main work in this paper is about a traffic analysis to support the services modules in the controller.

The main analysis components involve: big data preprocessing, analysis methods library, combination and mining and visualization.

A. Big Data Preprocessing In Internet traffic measurement and analysis, flow-  based traffic monitoring methods are widely deployed throughout Internet Service Providers (ISPs), because the volume of processed data is reduced and many convenient flow statistics tools are available. After storing flow data from flow probes on the local disk, we move the raw flow files to the cluster file system, HDFS. As the current  Hadoop mapper supports only text files for the input format, we convert flow files to text-format ones. As the size of text-format flow files is much larger than that of binary- format ones, we need to support binary flow files to the inputs for Mapper.

B. Analysis methods library Analysis methods library mainly contains classification,  clustering and association rules.

Traffic classification, the process to find out what type of application protocols used by the end users, is an essential component for network management. The traditional method is port-based, which inspects the transport-layer port number fields in packet headers and then identifies the application-layer protocols according to the well-known port. However, this method has become increasingly inaccurate. Deep packet inspection (DPI) can either match signature patterns in packet payloads or validate application- layer protocol message formats. However, DPI approach has high computational overheads and requires some up-to-date knowledge of the target protocols beforehand. BLINC[23] introduces a new approach for traffic classification. The basic idea of BLINC is to look at the communication pattern generated by a particular host, and to compare it to the behavior patterns representing different applications.

BLINC is able to accurately associate hosts with the services they provide or use. Therefore, we can identify new appearing applications such as P2P and VoIP in order to understand the make up of traffic in application level.

Traffic Clustering, the aim of cluster analysis is to partition a set of objects into groups or clusters in such a way that profiles of objects in the same group are similar, whereas the profiles of objects in different clusters are distinct.

Generally speaking, cluster analysis methods are of two types: hierarchical and partitioning methods. K-means clustering [24] is a clustering analysis algorithm that groups objects based on their feature values into K disjoint clusters.

In this paper we use K-means clustering method to partition users based on their network usage patterns.

C. Combination and Mining As input to the data mining process, we make use of  flow records. In this context, a flow is defined as a unidirectional stream of IP packets identified by a common IP five-tuple (protocol type, source IP address, destination IP address, source port, destination port). Apart from the IP five-tuple information, a flow record contains statistical information such as the number of packets and bytes observed in a certain period of time. First, flow records are classified according to the transport protocol and predefined port numbers which are typical for commonly used services.

Distinguishing flows by their protocol and service-specific port numbers thus allows applying the K-means clustering algorithm separately for different services identified by their (protocol, port) pairs. Separately for each class, we aggregate and transform flow records into datasets for     equally spaced time intervals, considering the start time of each flow.

D. Visulization For data mining to be effective, it is important to  include the human in the data exploration process and combine the flexibility, creativity, and general knowledge of the human with the enormous storage capacity and the computational power of computers. The basic idea of visual data exploration is to present the data in some visual form, allowing the human to get insight into the data, draw conclusions, and directly interact with the data. Visualizing the clustering results can help to quickly assimilate this information and provide insights that support and complement textual descriptions or statistical summaries.

For example, we quickly wish to know how well defined are the clusters, how different are they from each other, what is their size, and do the observations belong strongly to the cluster or only marginally.

The following sections will analyze the dataset in four aspects: overview, user behaviors, application service and locations. All of what we do is to make some useful analysis results to support the SDN controller managements and decision.



IV. DATASETS AND PREPROCESSING  A. Datasets We capture traffic in data plane from a commercial,  city-wide 3G UMTS network in a metropolitan in China.

The simplified topology of the 3G UMTS network we consider is pictured in Figure 2. Based on GN signaling monitoring we are able to capture all mobile users? data traffic. By using the optical equipment we create a traffic image from the GGSN. And then we apply a deep packet inspection (DPI) module to parse the data and finally generate user access data traffic logs. The original data set contains 32 attributes including phone number, capture time, IMEI (SV), URL, content type, up flow, down flow, location, etc. The volume of data set is about 1.8T and time span is covering 7 days. To simplifying the analysis and focus on some important problems we extract part of the all 32 attributes. The vital attributes that we analyze later is shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Description of part attributes of data set Attribute Name Description  CAPTURETIME Start Time. Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.xxxxxxxxx  MSISDN Mobile Subscriber International ISDN/PSTN number (Phone Number) URL Error rate is less than 0.001%  CONTENTLEN The length of the content CONTENTTYPE The type of the content  RESPDELAY Response delay. Unit is a millisecond DURATION The duration of a link  FLOW The sum of up flow and down flow UPFLOW The up flow of a link  DOWNFLOW The down flow of a link LAC location area code CI CI/SAC: Cell Identity/Service Area Code  RATTYPE RAT Type. ?1? is 2G, ?2? is 3G The 7-day span of data traffic set is collected from  March 11, 2013 to March 17, 2013. Considering the time of data set we can see that this data set can reflect the latest user behaviors and URLs distribution. This ?up to date? feature will bring us valuable nowadays data traffic using situation.

We expect that the dramatic growth of the mobile network development, continuing upgrade of Smartphone operating system and evolution of web service demand the data set of real-time.

It is possible to find more interesting result from this data set than what we have done in this paper because the attributes consist solid information and each other has a potential correlation that can predict some other meaningful regular pattern.

Figure 2. A simplified architectural view of a 3G UMTS network  B. Preprocessing Preprocess Implementation. Our data preprocess is  implemented by using Hive. Hive is a data warehouse system for Hadoop that facilitates easy data summarization and the analysis of large datasets stored in Hadoop compatible file systems. Hive provides a mechanism to project structure onto this data and query the data using a SQL-like language called HiveQL. This allows us to parallelize the data extraction and group operation. And Hive dramatically reduces the amount and difficulty of our work in processing with data set of big volume. Our Hadoop platform consists of one namenode and nine datanodes.

Each server has 16 CPU cores and 48G memory. The average time of Hive operation is less than ten minutes.

To utilize the benefits of Hive in dealing with massive data we implement five different operators by HiveQL: Select, Groupby, Sort, Count and Sum. These basic operators are well covering the main data processing and save our much time and effort.

C. Limitations One limitation of our work is that we have not standard  criteria to classify the service type. And it is also difficult to classify user behaviors by URL patterns since URLs are various and some of them are presented as IP addresses that hard to decrypt. Another limitation is that we only have one data set and are lack of information about control-plane information and detail of network framework like topology and traffic strategy. This makes us unable to go deep in giving suggestions to network operators from our observations and conclusions.



V. MEASUREMENT RESULTS  A. Overview Since we have not only one-day data set we first give a  general overview of our all captured data traffic. Beside the traffic volume distribution in each day time we also focus on other attributes such as user numbers, request numbers and response delay. Only one or two attributes are not convincing enough that traffic distributions of each day are stable. The interest of what we are looking for is more in the difference than the common ground.

Figure 3. User number (per hour) over three days  Figure 4.Average request times per userover three days We compare user number and average user request times variation trend over three days: March 15, March 16 and March 17 in 2013. March 15 is Friday and March 16, 17 are weekend of China work tradition. From Figure 3 we can see from 0:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. user number trends are correlative over three days but from afternoon to 24:00 the user number trends are not consistent. Therefore user number trend can be different in each day.  We also compare the average user request number in Figure 4 and find the change of request number trends are similar over three different days.

In the following analysis, we only focus on the 1-day traces on March 17, 2013 for analysis simplicity purpose.

To classify users is an effective method not only can reduce the data set volume but also more significantly discover user behaviors, which can be meaningful to understand the whole network utilization. However, there is not only one criterion to categorize users and it is hard to choose the best one. Therefore, we put users into four categories: morning users, afternoon users, evening users and midnight users by dividing the 24 hours into four splits.

According to Figure 5 we choose a series of time spans and the break point is the time with big change of the user number. Table 2 presents the details.

B. User Behaviors Characteristics  Figure 5. User number distribtuion in one day Table 2. Time spans of user categories  Time Span Description 1:00 a.m. ~ 7:00 a.m. Midnight user 7:00 a.m. ~ 2:00 p.m. morning user 2:00 p.m. ~ 6:00 p.m. afternoon user 6:00 p.m. ~ 1:00 a.m. evening user  Figure 6 presents behaviors of four different kinds of users. Picture (a) shows the request number per user of four kinds. We can see evening users have the highest average request number than others. Ignoring the number of midnight users, we can discover that midnight users are frequent network user. Users in afternoon type have the lowest average request number and this result conform to our intuition that people are usually busy and tire in the afternoon. Picture (b) reveals the total up flow and down flow usage patterns in different types of users and otherwise picture (c) reveals the average of up flow and down flow usage. The interesting finding is that the midnight users have second highest down flow but the up flow is not remarkable difference with other three categories of users.

We can infer that midnight user has common up flow usage behaviors and particular high down flow usage in per user dimension.

C. Application Characteristics Table 3. Description of content types  Content-Type Description  Application  The application content type allows for the transmission of application data or binary data, effectively allowing for specific handling of application data.

Image The image content type allows standardized image files to be  Text The text content type is used for message content that is primarily in human-readable text character format.

Audio The audio content type allows standardized audio files to be included in messages.

Video The video content type allows standardized video files to be included in messages.

Multipart Multi-part Content-Type headers identify multipart messages.

Other The CONTENTTYPE attribute is unable to put into any types above.

From the dataset, we can get all users? URLs they have visited and the content type of a certain user request. In this paper we characterize the applications by classify the content type. The content type is MIME types, which are specified in two parts. The top-level media type declares the     general type of media, and the subtype defines the specific format for that media. Here we select the top-level media type and category the application into seven types. Table 3 shows the application types considered in our analysis.

In Figure 7 (a), we can see image and application types occupy the most part of down flow. Text and video types account for 10% and 6%. Compared with (a) the distribution of up flow is very different in (b). Application type dominates the majority of the up flow. Text, image and other types each accounts for nearly 20% up flow. In Figure 7 (c), each segment means the number of users that use a certain application type a day. In addition, to a user he or she might be included in not only one segment in the same day. Figure 7 (c) implicates that most of users use application type and the following type is text, other and video. The usage request distribution is displayed in Figure 7 (d). The request number of image type is near the same with the application. Considering the user number of image type is much less than the application user number, we can see the image type user use image type application more frequently than users of application type.

Figure 6. User behaviors characteristics result   Figure 7. Application characteristics  D. Location Characteristics One prominent feature of mobile network is the user  equipment (UE) can be portable that means any user can move to several places in a day. Hence, the movement ability in this paper is a critical dimension taken into consideration. Each log in the dataset consist the user location presented by LAC and CI. By combining the LAC and CI we can identify a unique location point. We define a user?s movement ability as the number of location points he or she visit in a day.

Figure 8. User number distribution in movement ability Figure 8 shows that during day time the number of users visited only one location account for 75% of total  user number. 18% users visited two locations and only 5%     users in three different locations used data service.

Other users which visited more than four locations  account only 2% of all users. This result implicates that a  great number of users do not like to use mobile Internet  in many different locations. However, the proportion of  user number cannot express all facts related with the  location dimension.

We also statistic the data flow usage per user in different movement abilities and we discover that users which visited three different locations has the largest average down flow from Figure 9. The flow unit is byte.

And to average up flow the three different locations user and other users have very high amount in a day. We should notice that ?other? users? number only account 2% of all users. Therefore, we can conclude that users with high movement ability are more likely to use mobile Internet service and contribute more data traffic flow than other users.

Figure 9.Flow per user distribution in movement ability Figure 10 can further implicate those users with more  locations use the mobile Internet more frequently. In addition, those users only stay in one place do not use data service frequently like others.

Figure 10.Request number per user distribution in movement ability By grouping dataset into parts according to base  station (BS), we depict a BS with its total up flow and total down flow during a day. Each BS could be presented as a specific point in Figure 11 where the X-axis represents the total up flow and the Y-axis represents total down flow.

We use K-means algorithm to cluster base stations and those BS sharing similar flow characteristics are put into a same cluster. In Figure 11 a bubble represents a cluster and the number of BS in the cluster determine the radius of the bubble. For the visualization reason the two largest down flow clusters are not display in the Figure 11.

Table 4 shows the center and the total number of each cluster. From Figure 11 we can see some interesting distribution and variation from clusters. First, the minimum  flow cluster account for 14.25% and the largest three clusters all account 29.43%. They account for near a half of the BS. Second, the larger flow clusters are more scattering than others are. Third, the mini flow BS clusters show a continuity, that is, the flow features do not change intensely.

VI. SUMMARY, IMPLICATIONS, AND CONCLUSIONS This section gives the summary our key observations  and describes some implications from the analysis results.

Conclusions involve the measurement results and our possible future work.

By grouping users into four parts, we find the midnight users have remarkable heavy usage of network. Although the number of midnight users account for a small portion, in average user usage perspective midnight users have second highest down flow data traffic and similar up flow volume with others. Another discovery is that midnight users have more average request times than afternoon users. Since midnight user category is not of big amount, we suggest they have some kind particular behavior pattern.

We also classify applications by identifying each log?s content type. From different aspects, we can see different application types have particular user usage. Video types account for 6% of total down flow volume. Application and image occupy most down flow volume and to up flow application, image, text and other all account for an equally important portions. User number distribution is very similar to up flow distribution and number of users that use other application account for remarkable 22% of all certain application users. User request distribution shows that image and application types both account for 30% and text     type comes to third place. These results reveal that application type dominates a significant part and down flow distribution is different from up flow distribution.

We analyze the correlations between user movement ability and other attributes. The number of users only with one location a day occupies 75% of all users and users with more than two locations only account for 2%. However, when we come to the average user usage high movement ability users have relative high up flow and down flow. And to request number per user they have the highest value than others. By clustering base stations, we find that the largest and minimum BS clusters account for almost 1/3 of the BS.

The mini flow clusters show more continuity than those scattering large flow clusters.

This paper analyzes the data-plane characteristics of a 3G UMTS city-wide network. From different dimension, we present a whole picture of user behaviors, applications and location characteristics. The observations from our analysis could be of interest to network operators and researchers to investigate more details information about 3G UMTS network. Understanding those traffic patterns of different applications and users, enable much more efficient routing by controller of software defined networking. Since our dataset is very new, our measurement results can reveal some characteristics of the latest UMTS network user behaviors and application service. We only discuss data collected in a specific city. However, considering the city location does not influence the user behaviors much seriously we believe that one city data analysis is applicable and useful to others. Our future work will go deep in some specific user behaviors and network usage patterns.
