Evaluation of Memory-Efficient 1-bit Compressed Sensing in Wireless Sensor Networks

Abstract?Wireless sensor networks generate big-data which  leads to overwhelming traffic in the networks. Compressed sensing (CS) can exploit signal sparsity to reduce the amount of traffic. We evaluate the performance of 1-bit CS with a circulant random bipolar measurement matrix. The results show that 1- bit CS can decrease traffic at higher degree in wireless sensor networks compared to the conventional CS. Moreover, applying a circulant random bipolar measurement matrix overcomes the limitation of memory in sensor nodes. The scheme is studied in terms of reconstruction accuracy and memory consumption by using real sensor data. The implementation on sensor nodes validates the viability on a practical system.



I. INTRODUCTION  Compressed sensing (CS) [1] exploits signal sparsity to reduce the amount of traffic generated from a big-data tech- nology e.g., wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The sensor data usually exhibits correlation among data which can be represented as sparse data in some domain. Lower power consumption for data transmission and server storage memory can be expected by applying the CS-based data compression.

1-bit CS can improve the performance of traffic reduction in wireless sensor networks while applying a circulant random bipolar measurement addresses the limitation of memory in sensor nodes.

CS conventionally represents high-dimensional signals in the form of smaller number of measurements by using ran- domized, linear, non-adaptive measurements. The conventional CS assumes that the measurements are real valued and have infinite bit precision. However, in practice the measurements are quantized into finite number of bits. In an extreme case, Boufounos et al. introduced ?1-bit CS? which uses only 1- bit quantization representing sign of the measurements [2].

Although more measurements are necessary in 1-bit CS, it can finally decrease the number of bits from the original high resolution quantized bitstream.

WSNs are composed of large number of distributed nodes, which capture huge amount of data and communicate with each other via wireless communication. The small sensor nodes usually have limited processing power, limited energy, and scarce memory. This work focuses on applying CS without violating the memory limitation which is crucial because it determines the feasibility of a desired application. A mea- surement matrix used in the CS measurement is stored in sensor nodes? limited memory, and it is accounted as main memory space consumption of CS data processing algorithm.

Since 1-bit CS requires more measurements which result in larger memory consumed by a measurement matrix, a circulant structured matrix [3] with entries randomly generated by  Fig. 1: Block diagram of compressed sensing.

Bernoulli distribution is introduced to cope with the memory issue.

In this paper we evaluate the performance of memory- efficient 1-bit CS which adopts a circulant random bipolar measurement matrix by using real sensor data including tem- perature, relative humidity, and illuminance. The results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the traffic and save significant amount of memory compared to the conventional CS under same conditions. Furthermore, the experiment on real sensor nodes is also conducted to verify our scheme.



II. CS BACKGROUND  When the original signals can be expressed as a large number of zero or nearly zero values and a small number of non-zero values, the signals are said to be ?sparse.? CS is a state-of-the-art data compression and reconstruction theory that exploits the fact that many natural signals are sparse or compressible in an appropriate basis such as Fourier, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) etc [1], [4].

Figure 1 shows the block diagram of CS. CS measurement is performed in data sources which is sensor nodes in our consideration. A measurement vector y which is an outcome of CS measurement is transmitted along the network to a root node to reconstruct the original signal. The root node which is usually a relatively high performance computer firstly finds a sparse solution s according to l1-norm minimization problem and then transform the sparse solution to a reconstructed signal corresponding to a sparsifying basis.

Unlike thresholding-based transformation compressions which also exploit the signal sparsity in some domains by  IEEE R10-HTC2013 Sendai, Japan, August 26-29, 2013     extracting high coefficients as an output, the encoding part of CS is universal among sensor data. The same encoding process can be done even when different sensor data are sparse in different domains. The sensor nodes do not require a knowledge of which domain the data is sparse. In another aspect, the reconstruction performance of CS is improvable ceaselessly. Given CS measurements stored in a server, the discovery of better sparsifying basis for the data can be applied at the reconstruction process to improve the reconstruction performance.



III. 1-BIT CS WITH STRUCTURED MEASUREMENT  A. 1-bit CS  When reducing traffic at high rate, the conventional CS suffers from insufficient measurements and results in high distortion from reconstruction. Therefore, we are interested in 1-bit CS where each measurement is quantized into one bit of sign information. At a given target number of bits of compressed data, 1-bit CS can increase the number of mea- surement. Despite of low resolution quantization, the additional measurements which may even exceed the number of original signal can improve the reconstruction accuracy and therefore lower distortion by 1-bit CS can be expected.

Let a length-N signal vector x be represented as a sparse vector s with the relationship x = ?s where ? is a basis matrix. In 1-bit CS measurement, the original signal vector x is compressed by an measurement matrix ? as follows  y = sign(?x) (1)  where y denotes the length-M acquired CS measurement vector. sign() function returns 1 for positive numbers and ?1 for negative numbers. Note that the conventional CS assumes that the measurements y are real valued and have infinite bit precision. Therefore Eq. (1) becomes y = ?x. However, in practice measurements y have to be quantized to a discrete value over some finite range before being further processed.

Let a system quantization be B bits. A total compression rate including quantization Rc is defined as the ratio between the number of bits required for a compressed and an original signal such that Rc = Mconv/N for the conventional CS and Rc = M1bit/BN for 1-bit CS.

Although the amplitude information is lost during 1-bit measurement stage, the reconstruction method [2] was pro- posed to enforce that the sparse solution s lies on the unit sphere and the l1 norm minimization problem becomes  min ?s?1 subject to y = sign(??s), ?s?2 = 1. (2)  As a comparison between the conventional and 1-bit CS, 1-bit CS can increase the number of measurement to BRcN compared to that of the conventional CS at RcN at a given target number of bits of compressed data. However, due to larger measurement matrix, memory requirement of 1-bit CS are increased by a factor of B to store the larger measurement matrix.

B. Structured Measurement  Generally, we require that coherence between the measure- ment matrix ? and the basis ? is small enough. A good choice for the measurement matrix ? is random matrices. In this work we consider two classes of sub-Gaussian distribution measurement matrix, namely Gaussian and bipolar random matrix. Since entries in bipolar random matrix are only 1 and ?1 which can be represented by only 1 bit, the use of bipolar random matrix as a measurement matrix can save some memory.

Instead of storing the fully random measurement matrix which occupies large memory space, applying partial random structured matrices as measurement matrices is encouraged. It has been shown that circulant random matrices with entries generated independently from the same distributions are also sufficient to satisfy the RIP (restricted isometry geometry) with high probability [5]. Given a stem vector c = (c0, ..., ci)T where i = max (M,N), the circulant matrix can be drawn as  C =  ? ???  c0 ci?1 ? ? ? c1 c1 c0 ? ? ? c2 ...

...

...

ci?1 ci?2 ? ? ? c0  ? ??? . (3)  In the conventional CS, we are interested when a number of raw signal N is larger than a number of measurement M , the measurement matrix will be a row submatrix of C. However, in most cases of 1-bit CS, a number of measurement M grows larger than a number of raw signal N . The constructed measurement matrix will be a column submatrix of C.

By using the circulant matrix, the memory required for storing measurement matrices is reduced significantly. The memory for storing conventional CS measurement matrices is reduced to O(N), unlike fully random matrices which occupy O(RcN  2). In the M > N 1-bit CS case, structured matrices consume O(BRcN) memory, while fully random matrices use O(BRcN  2). This comparison is done based on a given fixed number of target compressed bits so that we can compare between the conventional CS and 1-bit CS.



IV. EVALUATION  We evaluate the performance of 1-bit CS with circulant random bipolar measurement by using real sensor data includ- ing temperature, relative humidity, illuminance of visible light (320 nm to 730 nm). The raw data is sensed by using TelosB wireless sensor nodes [6].

A. Simulation  We compare the introduced scheme with the conventional CS and a fully random Gaussian measurement, and their combinations. The conventional CS uses B = 16 bits for quantization. GPSR [7] and BIHT [8] are used as reconstruc- tion algorithms for the conventional and 1-bit CS, respectively.

DCT basis is employed as our sparsifying basis. The eval- uation is done in MATLAB by using 10-day data collected from 83 sensors. The data are compressed and reconstructed independently every hour (120 samples). It is worthwhile to notice that the signal vector x is consistently removed the DC  IEEE R10-HTC2013 Sendai, Japan, August 26-29, 2013     0.02 0.06 0.1 0.14 0.18 0.22 0.26 0.3  0.05  0.1  0.15  0.2  0.25  0.3  0.35  0.4  Total compression rate including quantization  A ve  ra ge  te m  pe ra  tu re  e rr  or (  ?C )     1?bit circulant bipolar Conv circulant bipolar 1?bit fully Gaussian Conv fully Gaussian  (a) Temperature  0.02 0.06 0.1 0.14 0.18 0.22 0.26 0.3 0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4  0.5  0.6  0.7  0.8  0.9  Total compression rate including quantization  A ve  ra ge  r el  at iv  e hu  m id  ity e  rr or  ( %  R H  )     1?bit circulant bipolar Conv circulant bipolar 1?bit fully Gaussian Conv fully Gaussian  (b) Relative humidity  0.02 0.06 0.1 0.14 0.18 0.22 0.26 0.3            Total compression rate including quantization  A ve  ra ge  il lu  m in  an ce  e rr  or (  lu x)     1?bit circulant bipolar Conv circulant bipolar 1?bit fully Gaussian Conv fully Gaussian  (c) Illuminance  Fig. 2: Average absolute error comparison in terms of compression rate.

Figure 2 shows the accuracy performance in terms of average absolute error at a corresponding compression rate of all three evaluated data. The results of different kinds of sensor data all agree to the same conclusion. As mentioned in Section III-A, the convention CS undergoes inadequate number of measurements that further lose more degree of freedom when using the structured matrix. As a result, applying the circulant random matrix to the conventional CS is undesirable option unlike using it with 1-bit CS. In 1-bit CS the distortion is slightly enhanced. In particularly, when the compression rate is 0.1, the distortion increased from when using fully random measurement matrix to when using circulant measurement matrix is elaborated as the following numbers: from 0.06?C to 0.08?C for temperature, from 0.18%RH to 0.24%RH for humidity, and from 11.7 lux to 12.9 lux for illuminance. There- fore, it is worthwhile to obtain significantly more compact measurement matrix.

B. Experiment  The implementation of the proposed scheme illustrates the feasibility on real sensor nodes. We implemented it on TelosB nodes whose ROM memory is 48 KB. A sensor acquires the data from an outdoor environment every 30 seconds and transmits by using reliable data collection protocol [6]. At compression rate of 0.1, the proposed scheme consumes only 24 B for storing a measurement matrix, while the fully random Gaussian measurement matrix occupies up to 2.9 KB and 46 KB in case of the conventional and 1-bit CS, respectively.

Figure 3 shows an example of 1-day data with its reconstruc- tion. The maximum absolute errors of each sensor data are 0.37?C, 0.42%RH, and 79 lux for temperature, humidity, and illuminance, respectively. In short, the scheme decreases 90% of traffic without significant effect on memory consumption and accuracy.

C. Discussion  Table I summarizes the characteristics of the conventional CS and 1-bit CS with different measurement matrices ac- cording to the calculation in Section III-B and the evaluation in Section IV-A. Notably, 1-bit CS with the structured mea- surement matrix achieves memory-efficient with sufficiently low distortion which suits to memory-limited applications employing small sensor nodes.

In this work, we evaluate the reconstruction accuracy in terms of distortion which is measured in absolute difference in real world unit because it can give an idea on real application and also be comparable to a sensor performance. The TelosB wireless sensor nodes are equipped with an SHT11 humidity and temperature sensor. The SHT11?s temperature sensing can provide ?0.5?C at 25?C accuracy with ?0.1?C repeatability,  IEEE R10-HTC2013 Sendai, Japan, August 26-29, 2013            T em  pe ra  tu re  (?

and the accuracy of ?3.5%RH along with the repeatability of ?0.1%RH for the relative humidity. The results show that the CS-based compression and reconstruction can achieve the same order of error with the sensor performance. The  reconstruction of temperature and relative humidity data are considerably accurate enough for most monitoring applica- tions. On the other hand, the fluctuating illuminance data cannot be recovered precisely at the abrupt peak. The sharp peak results in low sparsity in DCT domain, and therefore the illuminance data has least degree of compressibility compared to other two data.



V. CONCLUSION  This paper shows an empirical study of 1-bit compressed sensing with a circulant random bipolar measurement on real sensor data which consists of temperature, relative humidity, and illuminance. The evaluation results demonstrate that in case of resource-limited wireless sensor networks, one may consider the circulant bipolar measurement matrix operating in 1-bit CS scheme as an outstanding candidate. The imple- mentation on real sensor nodes also reveals the feasibility of the introduced scheme practically.
