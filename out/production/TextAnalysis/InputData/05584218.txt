Abstract?Addresses are one of the most popular geographical reference systems in natural language. Addresses are considered as the most effective approach to bridging the gap between business data in management information system (MIS) and GIS, which supports geospatial information visualization and spatial analysis. One significant problem in Chinese address geocoding is the irregular address expressions, which makes it impossible to get a nationwide address content standardization. In order to solve this problem, this paper presents an approach to automatically extraction and visualization of address models. In this approach, we focus on the binary relationship between two address elements rather than address templates. Based on the classification of address elements and splitting of large- scale Chinese addresses, we use boolean association rules to induce address models. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is more flexible and practical in analyzing Chinese address structures for geocoding service.

I.  INTRODUCTION Address geocoding, often abbreviated as geocoding, is  defined as the processing of converting street addresses into map coordinates [1]. Therefore, the aim of geocoding process is to generate a geographical location (longitude and latitude) from street address information in the data source.

Once geocoded, the data can be used for further processing, in spatial data mining projects, and it can be visualized and combined with other data using Geographical Information Systems ?GIS?[2]. So the process of geocoding forms a basic fundamental component of spatial analysis in a wide variety of research disciplines and application domains.

Generically, geocoding works in three stages [3]. First, the input address data must be analyzed and structured according to some template (this is also called address model), in a parsing stage. Second, compares the structured address data with the contents of the addressing database, using several different geocoding methods. This is also called matching part. Third, a location is determined according to the results of the matching stage.

All the three parts are well solved in many western countries and are now a standard functionality of commercial GIS softwares (e.g. ArcGIS and MapInfo). However,  geocoding in China has been a persistent problem ever since 1990s [1]. One of the big challenges in Chinese geocoding is the complexity in the Chinese address structures, which hindered the geocoding work in the first step (the parsing step).

Here we present a method to analyzing the structure of address components which is also called address models.

The models we get can serve in address standardization, parsing and matching works.



II. BACKGROUND Addresses are used to uniquely identify particular points  of interests, to access and deliver to specific locations, and as a means of positioning geographic data based on location.

They are widely used by the state and local government and the public. Most organizations maintained their own list of addresses on their own usage purpose. In order to facilitate the exchange of address information, the federal geographic data committee (FGDC) had passed an address data content standard [4], which clearly defined address metadata, address structure, address type and so on.

Address models are constructed on the basis of address elements which are discrete units of address information. In western countries, address components are clearly grouped , like: street name, street type, direction, unit number, zones, door number, building number, neighborhood, city, state, country and so on[3]. Address models are often been considered as simple hierarchical structures. In ArcGIS? Geocoding package, there are totally 32 address locator styles, from single field locator to addresses with zip and altname locator. The rich choice on locator styles makes the geocoding system more flexible and adaptive to different addresses formats, more practical in different geocoding service.

Unlike the situation in western countries, Chinese addresses have evolved over hundreds of years, under the control of thousands jurisdictions, stored in different formats and database files, all these factors lead to the particular complex geoprocessing and modeling works. Therefore getting address templates from complex address datasets is a big challenge. Research has been done during all these years.

The idea of changing the whole address naming systems aims to solve the irregular address naming problem at the root [5]. However, it is not operative considering time and costs. Some used finite automata to imitate the transition from one address component to another [6]. And it is a good  This paper is funded by the ?863 Project? (2007AA12Z221) and the National Science Foundation project (40971231). Corresponding author: Xueying Zhang. Email: zhangsnowy@163.com     approach, but still needs transition information first. Some used rule based method to find address templates and it is proved to be useful [1]. Considering the diversity in Chinese addresses, the manual rule based method is time and energy consuming.

So find a more practical way to construct address models is essential in Chinese geocoding. Here we use Boolean association rules to construct address models.



III. PREPARING WORKS  A. Classification Of Address Elements In foreign countries, an address record always contains  some fixed address elements, including ?door number?, ?street name?, ?street type?, ?directions? and so on.

Classification in address categories is simple and clear.

However in china classification is an indispensable part before analyzing address structures. All the classification work in china is based on address keywords.

Address keywords, also known as address suffix, like ?? ?city?, ??county?, ??raod?, ??number??, are the signs for the sort of address elements. Compared to the western countries, Chinese addressing systems are more complicated for the country?s long history and rich culture.

In 2008 State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping released surveying and mapping industry standardization technical documents (CH/Z 9002-2007) [7]. According to this file, address elements are divided into 6 categories and some regulations are made in address expressions.  Because it did not consider the details, we should enrich it in our practice.

Summarizing the address keywords in Nanjing and referencing the country? s administrative division code (GB 2260-1995), we classified the address elements into 10 categories : RD (administrative divisions)(including RDPROV(province), RDCITY(city), RDDIST(district), RDCOUN(county), RDTOWN(town), RDCSID(countryside), RDVILL(village), RDGROU(group), RDTEAM(team)), PC(organizations and symbol buildings), LS(alleyway),LR(main road), RS(residential place),RJ(settlements),RZ(natural features), PH(buildings), PU(units), PD(door number).

B. Dataset Parsing The parsing results are the fundamental data sets that  address models are extracted from. Chinese addresses like many eastern language based addressing systems, do not have delimiters between words. This poses the work of segmentation. In theory, Chinese address resolution is similar to word segmentation in Chinese natural language processing.

We used rule based parsing method [8] with the combination of machine learning method (e.g. conditional random fields) [9] to parse Chinese addresses.

For example, the input address records are as follows: ?????????? 5 ?(No.5 Hebin Park Xiongzhou Town Luhe  District)  ????????? 108 ? (No.108 Chaotian Street Xiongzhou Town Luhe District)  After the segmentation process, the outcomes are as follows:  ???/RDDIST ???/RDTOWN ????/RS 5 ?/PD (No.5/PD Hebin Park/RS Xiongzhou Town/RDTOWN Luhe District/RDDIST)  ???/RDCOUN ???/RDTOWN ???/LR 108?/PD (No.108/PD Chaotian Street/LR Xiongzhou Town/RDTOWN Luhe District/RDCOUN)  Space splits addresses into address elements, the annotations after the character ?/? represent the categories of address elements.  As shown above, the annotation ?PD? stands for the door number part in addresses.

After the parsing work, the address records are parsed into single address elements. These works provides data for model construction.

C. Address templates When the addresses are successfully parsed, we get many  annotated records. Following the traditional way, we get address templates from the vast address data sets using statistical methods?like city-town-street-door number in the example above.

We get so many address templates, such as  city ?district ?organization  city ?district ?street?door number  city ?street ?door number  ?  The idea is proved to be right, but the results we get are not satisfying. First, the probability of each address templates is very low, there are no predominant address templates.

What?s more, the quantity of the templates are numerous, if only one element in the template is different from the existing one then it will considered to be a new template.

Third, the amount of the templates is very sensitive to the changes in address elements? granularity. The smaller the address elements? granularity the larger the amount of address templates would be.



IV. ASSOCIATION RULES  A.  Boolean Association Rules Association rule mining is a method that used to find  frequent patterns, associations, correlations, or causal structures among sets of items or objects in transaction or relational databases, and other information repositories [10].

It can be defined into three categories: based on the types of values, based on the dimensions of data and based on the levels of abstraction [11]. Here we introduce the first category---Boolean association rule mining.

Two important parameters in association rules:  Support: s% T  N   T X YT  N   T D (1)  Confidence:c%    X Y   X              (2)     ?D? stands for the total transactions. ?X? different properties. So s%  represents the ?X?Y? contains in ?D?, while c%  represents probability that the transactions have ?X? also h  B. The Mining Process In ArcGis? geocoding package, address  divided into 32 categories, from ?single fiel Range? [12]. Followed this way, in some address geocoding applications, researchers some commonly used address templates and geocoding practice. Founder Digital Corpora 17 categories of address templates in the Map And in the collaboration project between Science and Technology co., Ltd and Beijin Resource Management Center-Beijing addr database system construction, 28 kinds of add are applied [13]. However, these address regional restricted, besides the deficits t explained in our temptation to get useful add So they can?t be widely used.

According to our work, address elements r not simply in a hierarchical structures, but in n address models are represented as the b between every two address elements, then the more clear and analyzable. So we used Boole rules to extract the binary relation between add  In this case, the parameters in the equation Boolean association rules have their o meanings. ?D? stands for the total number records. ?X? and ?Y?   represent different add What?s more, ?X?Y? contains sequential me be put right after ?X? in the address records.

?S% ?stands for the probability of address pair in ?D? and ?C%? stands for the conditional p ?Y? is shown after ?X? when ?X ? is showed.

?C%? represents the transference probability element ?X? to address element ?Y?.

Min-sup and min-conf are the minim ?Support? and ?Confidence? respectively. For pair, if the support and the confidence are above the minimum, it can be extracted.

The sequential information between address elements is showed as the lines connect different parts of oval-shapes: when the line is connected to the oval-shape?s bottom then the oval-shape is the previous address elements and when the line connected to the top of the oval-shape, the oval-shape is the next address element.

Setting different minimum parameters (min-support and min-conf), we get different mining results. Association rule mining can help us get rid of redundant information in addresses, and extract the information we want. The larger the amount of the address records the greater help the association rules can bring.



V. CONLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we used the principle of association rules to  construct Chinese address models and make the models in a visual form. It represents a new perspective to analyzing Chinese addresses--binary relationship between address elements.

We currently used the Boolean association rule which is the simplest in three association rules. As the work developed we thought that dimensional association rules may be more suitable, because we have found the dimensional features in the address elements classification. So this would be our next effort.

Address models can make the complex address structures more clear and analyzable. As we extracted the useful models from the parsed address records, the next step is to put it into the geocoding practice: standardization, parsing and matching.
